<p class="redbar"><a id="why" name="why"></a>Why The General
Strike?</p>
<p>Every intelligent person now realizes that there is something
radically wrong with the social system under which we are living.
Everyone, excepting the beneficiaries of this system, agrees that
something ought to be done about it. The trouble is that people
at present seem unable to agree on any common program of action.
Some accept their unhappy lot with a patience and fortitude
worthy of a better cause, others theorize ineffectually and do
little, while still others complain bitterly and strike out
blindly. Nearly everyone rushes hither and tither seeking escape
but without having any clear-cut objective in view. Considering
the control of the press and all media of misinformation and
propaganda by the present ruling class this situation is not to
be wondered at.</p>
<p>Let us examine briefly the things people in general are saying
and doing about the desperate situation now confronting society:
One group says: "Let us be patient until pressure of public
opinion brings about a change or at least a betterment of
conditions." Another group says: "As long as we have the ballot
let us use political action to bring about whatever changes are
necessary." Still another group states: "We cannot wait any
longer. Only a violent upheaval . . . armed insurrection!"</p>
<p>These groups, regardless of their differences of opinion, are
composed of men and women who have given some thought and study
to the subject. They deserve credit for trying to find a solution
for the baffling problem confronting them. No matter how mistaken
they may be their efforts are at least directed toward making the
world a fit place to live in. Unfortunately a majority of the
population have not gone this far. The majority still lives and
suffers in a condition of unthinking bewilderment. They simply do
not know what it is all about. Just as they have done, for ages
past, they are content to work like robots or starve like dumb
beasts without daring to organize to put a stop to the system
which is crushing them. And, what is worse they are actually
misled into supporting this system.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/agitators/modern/others/general_strike.jpg" /></p>
</center>
<p class="redbar"><a id="economic" name="economic"></a>Economic
Illness, Economic Cure</p>
<p>But there is still another and far more significant group.
This group represents the viewpoint of the awakened and
class-conscious working class. Its opposition to the present
order is unalterable and its methods and objective distinctly
those of the world's revolutionary proletariat. This group takes
the position that, in the face of the present disintegration of
the profit or wage system, public opinion, political action and
armed insurrection are too unweildly, too uncertain and too
unscientific to serve in so great an emergency. This group
advocates a General Strike of the world's army of production and
its managerial staff as the means of putting an end to
capitalism, and inaugurating in its place an era of scientific
industrialism and industrial democracy.</p>
<p>The argument for the General Strike is based on the persistent
and very logical working class conviction that the ruling class
will refuse to permit itself to be dispossessed by any power
weaker than its own and that public opinion, political action and
insurrection therefore will not be permitted to be developed or
used to any appreciable extent. It is further based on the firm
belief that Labor alone can save the world from chaos during and
following the period of transition. As long as the production of
goods under any system depends on the disciplined solidarity of
the producing class it is evident that this solidarity alone is
capable of stopping the operations of the old order or of
starting and continuing those of the new.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="opinion" name="opinion"></a>Public
Opinion</p>
<p>In this sense the General Strike is not only the hope of
Labor; it is the hope of the human race. It is the one method
which will be found trust-worthy when all other methods fail. If
it is true, as many believe, that the economic maladjustments of
modern society can be remedied only be economic measures, then
the General Strike will become increasingly important with every
passing day. The necessity of the collective ownership and
democratic operation of socially necessary machinery is now
conceded by technician, economist, student and class-conscious
worker alike. There is diversity of opinion as to how the change
is to be made, but there is no lack of unanimity as to the
advisability of the change. In this regard the program of the
General Strike is too important not to be seriously
considered.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact any power less potent than that of a
General Strike is bound to be of doubtful efficacy. Public
opinion in America at its best is merely a means of registering
the disapproval or indignation of an intelligent minority. At its
worst it is all that the Powers that Be could expect of it-- mass
hysteria and mob violence to be directed at will by those
affluent enough to buy it on the market like any other commodity.
Any public opinion which ignores the basic fact of the class
struggle is bound to be a hypocritical gesture. In this regard
the liberals are among the worst offenders. The weak cry of the
conventional liberal for peace in a peaceless world is one of the
most convincing evidences of the innate sterility of the liberal
attitude. Due to their hopelessly restricted outlook these middle
class muddlers are unable to see the inevitability of struggle
and strife as long as society is divided into two classes with
irreconcilable interests.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="reformers" name="reformers"></a>Reformers</p>
<p>Unless the class struggle is used as a key, human history will
remain a matter of guesswork. Unless the evolution of society is
studied in the light of social science, social changes will
remain inexplicable. How much clearer and less confusing is the
position of the Industrial Workers of the World as expressed in
its Preamble,</p>
<blockquote>"The working class and the employing class have
nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and
want are found among the millions of the working people and the
few, who make up the employing class have all the good things in
life."</blockquote>
<p>This is submitted as a clear-cut statement of undeniable
fact.</p>
<p>Reformers of all types are and must be primarily concerned
with the patching up of the decayed and historically
unjustifiable capitalist system. They are unable to see society
as a process of change under economic pressure-- a continuous
evolution from one stage of development to another, based on the
iron law of economic determinism. Under chattel slavery or
serfdom these myopic gentlemen would have believed as they do now
under capitalism that the existing system was permanent,
preordained and historically unassailable. To them riches and
poverty are not the result of definable and remediable social
maladjustments but the normal condition of human life. The
invention of labor-saving, profit increasing machinery, as they
see it, was not a part of an evolutionary process; they prefer to
believe it was merely a convenient and very profitable accident.
They are childishly amazed that their right to to monopolize the
earth and her resources should ever be contested. There are even
authors, editors and professors who support them in this
fantastic illusion. On this point the position of the I.W.W. is
as startling as it is scientifically sound:</p>
<blockquote>"Between these two classes a struggle must go on
until the workers organize as a class, take possession of the
earth and the machinery of production, and abolish the wage
system."</blockquote>
<p>If any liberal is capable of seeing that far he is already
cured of his liberalism.</p>
<p>Public opinion being largely at the mercy of the predatory
interests through their control fo the press, radio, etc., is
therefore largely out of the question as a means of effecting
fundamental social change. Even the unusual program and
personality of Ghandi would be helpless in the face of the
private control of public opinion which exists in the U.S.A.
Within a fortnight the mild-mannered Mahatma would be heaved into
the hoosegow charged with planting a bomb or engineering a
pay-roll robbery. Such things have happened before with the
public being far from unconvinced.</p>
<p>And so the capitalist control of the machinery of publicity
coupled with the economic ignorance of the much divided and long
misled masses makes public opinion as the sole method of ending
the nightmare of capitalism somewhat remote. Unless crystallized
into definite and determined action of some sort or other, about
all we can expect from public opinion is the registering of
belated and somewhat pathetic disapproval.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="politicos" name="politicos"></a>Politicos</p>
<p>Political action as a method of obtaining control of the
machinery of production seems also peculiarly unconvincing. Only
the most naive of politically-minded revolutionists believes that
the ballot or constitutional amendments will induce the Vested
Interests to give over control and title to the privately owned
machinery of production. It is manifestly absurd to expect the
class which has stained the pages of history red in countless
labor struggles to give over complete control because the
electorate (whom they despise) have seen fit to demand it. The
parasite class of the U.S.A. can be relied upon not to relinquish
their sacrosanct rights to 'property' until they are confronted
with a power greater than that which they have at their command.
Anything less will be scoffed at.</p>
<p>What is more probable, in the light of past experience, than
their capitulation is that the right of sufferage will be revoked
or curtailed the moment it threatens to be used for any purpose
other than the customary horse-swapping. Even with the menace of
the ever-present potential fascist dictatorship removed, there is
little reason to believe that the rich will ever hand over their
property to the poor just because the poor have decided to vote
for it.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="insurrectos" name="insurrectos"></a>Insurrectos</p>
<p>The program of armed insurrection is open to as many angles of
criticism as that of political action. First of all the workers
as a whole are not only unarmed, but they are untrained in the
use of arms. Twelve airplanes can destroy a city and it is quite
unlikely that a city of armed workers could control even so small
a force of capitalist mercenaries. The technique of modern
warfare has made the rifle and the side-arm, and even grenades
and machine guns obsolete in the face of tanks, poison gas,
planes and heavy artillery. The advocacy of armed insurrection is
fatally misleading because it induces workers to believe that
what was done in a backward country can be duplicated in a
thoroughly modern one. In America the chances of mobs defeating
highly trained troops are anything but even. Then there is the
danger of premature revolution precipitated by fanatics or stool
pigeons.</p>
<p>The advocacy of armed insurrection is misleading also because
most of its protagonists, being politically minded and
politically-trained, are more determined to capture State power
than to capture the industries. The politician is utterly
incapable of thinking in terms of industry. He is incompetent
either to control or direct industrial processes. In a country
like the U.S.A. with 48 state and hundreds of municipal and
county capitals in addition to the federal capital in
Washington-- all adequately guarded-- the problem is almost
hopelessly complicated. At the worst an attempt at armed uprising
would result in a series of unprecedented massacres, at best in
an overtowering and very stupid bureaucracy or an equally stupid
and far more cruel dictatorship of politicians.</p>
<p>It is far more probable that neither the ballots of the
politicos nor the bullets of the insurrectos will ever have an
opportunity to 'get to first base.' With the final struggle
impending it is very probable that all weapons save that of
economic action will have been taken out of their hands. For this
reason it is more necessary for Labor to study and prepare itself
for the General Strike than to trust its fortunes to either
ballots or bullets as a sole means of effecting its deliverance
from the toils of wage slavery.</p>
