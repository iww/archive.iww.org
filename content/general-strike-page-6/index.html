<p class="redbar"><a id="job" name="job"></a>The One Big Strike
on the Job</p>
<p>It may be argued however that the General Strike might prove
to be as difficult to control and, due to the possible paralysis
of transport, equally productive of privation as civil war. If
State power were not captured by the workers would not the armed
forces of the master class crush the strike with military power?
Would not the result in the long run be the same as far as mass
starvation and disorganization are concerned?</p>
<p>The answer is that, as the I.W.W. conceives of the General
Strike, it would be so perfectly organized by workers and
technicians and effectually used that the feeding, supplying and
transportation of armed mercenaries would be practically
impossible. The strikes at Seattle and Winnipeg gave some
indication of the ability of strikers to organize, picket and
police their strike and, at the same time arrange for the
adequate distribution of food stuffs to the population. As for
machine guns, tanks, airplanes and bombs of asphyxiating or
incendiary character, it is well to remember that such things are
only available when they are manufactured and transported by
labor and would be more difficult to use against workers
stationed in and about the nation's widely spread industries than
against mobs massed together in the labor ghettoes of the great
cities.</p>
<p>According to the modern idea of the General Strike it would
not be at all necessary, during a well organized class movement
of this sort for the employed workers to leave their assigned
places in industry at all. On the contrary, the effort would be
made to get workers into the industries instead of out of them in
order to keep the wheels of production going. The General Strike,
in other words would be a means of feeding rather than of
starving the people.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with the I.W.W. program of STRIKING ON THE
JOB. The only difference would be that the factory doors, under
the direction of the technical managerial staff of the productive
forces, would be thrown wide open to absorb the millions of
unemployed. The wheels of industry would operate in their
customary manner only for the purpose of supplying human needs
instead of the enrichment of a profit-greedy Kept Class.</p>
<p>The General Strike therefore would simply mean that the army
of production under competent technical and managerial direction,
would continue to man and remain in the industries, producing and
transporting goods for consumption but refusing any longer to
yeild up surplus value to the parasite class. The General Strike
would be a General Lockout against these idle drones who now hold
as their `private property' the machinery upon which the human
race depends for life.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="opposition" name="opposition"></a>Mass
Opposition to Exploitation</p>
<p>The General Strike is conditioned upon the WILL of the workers
to make it effective and their stubborn determination to put an
end to exploitation by producing goods for USE instead of PROFIT.
Unlike the small strike the General Strike does not necessarily
depend on the complete withdrawal of productive effort from
machinery, but rather their ability to withdraw or withhold only
such effort as will put a complete stop to the profits of the
parasitic 'owners'.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the General Strike as regards wages is to
give each producer the full product of his labor. The demand for
better wages becomes revolutionary only when it is coupled with
the demand that the exploitation of labor must cease. Labor is
exploited at the point of production, and it is at the point of
production alone that Labor can stop the idle, absentee drones
from receiving any more than they produce. Only the complete
disallowal of any share whatever to nonproducers will guarantee
economic justice to the working class. Working conditions under
capitalism have occasioned many bitter controversies but even the
most necessary demands for their betterment could hardly be
called revolutionary. Even under Industrial Democracy such things
will be matters of expediency and consistently sustained
improvement, in keeping with recognized needs.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="short" name="short"></a>Short Hours, THE
Revolutionary Demand</p>
<p>The demand for shorter hours however is decidedly a
revolutionary demand. On the basis of an eight hour day less than
three hours are all that is necessary for the worker to earn his
wage; the rest of the day he is employed in producing surplus
value for the boss. Each hour of the shortened workday means for
the employer one hour's less profits from every man employed--
one hour less opportunity to exploit. This accounts for the fact
that the worker's demands for shorter hours have always been
contested more vigorously than demands for better conditions or
even increased wages.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious: The difference between the six hour day
and the eight hour day is the difference between the three hours
and five hours given to the employer in which to sweat profits
from the hides of his help, each hour of reduction being made at
the expense of the exploiter. The difference between the six hour
day and, say, the three hour day is the difference between three
hours of profit-sweating and none at all. Therefore, if the
employer wishes to continue to live off the labor of his wage
slaves he must (and does) guard jealously the length of the
toiler's work day. Upon it depends not only the amount of his
unearned income but also the continuation of his privilege to
live without producing.</p>
<p>The chief demand of the General Strike would therefore
logically be a demand for an average workday of not longer than
three hours or whatever length of time is technologically
necessary to carry on production on a non-profit basis. This is
the most revolutionary of all demands because it dries up the
possibility of class exploitation at its source. Under a planned
industrial system and with the perfected machinery of modern
production placed at the disposal of the human race even with the
present staff of competent directors there is no reason at all
(apart from the profit system) why anyone should be forced to
work longer than two and a half or three hours per day. Any
workday longer than that required to do the actual necessary work
of the world simply serves to fatten the already hog-fat
parasites of industry. The General Strike for the three hour day
would not only put the millions of unemployed back to work, but
it would also put the Thieves of Big Business to work alongside
of them. In this regard it is well to remember that I.W.W.
loggers in the northwest won the eight hour day by the simple
expedient of blowing the whistle at the end of eight hours and
then walking off the job en masse.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="picket" name="picket"></a>The General
Strike and General Picketing</p>
<p>The I.W.W. is credited with having introduced two outstanding
tactics of industrial warfare into the American labor movement--
the strike on the job and mass picketing by the unemployed. Both
of these are of utmost importance to the successful operation of
the General Strike. In fact the success of the move (apart from
competent technological direction) would depend upon the
solidarity existing between employed and unemployed workers. In a
class strike this solidarity is indispensible, because only by
joint action and common understanding of this sort can the hours
of labor be shortened to permit all to return to work. The effect
on the capitalist system of millions of unemployed picketing the
factory gates for a shorter workday can easily be imagined. By so
doing the jobless would not only be hitting at the root cause of
unemployment (long hours) but they would also be hitting at the
root cause of exploitation (the private ownership of socially
necessary machinery).</p>
<p>It may be objected that, admitting the General Strike to be a
good thing, there is still but slight possibility that it will
ever be used. The answer is affirmative. There is every reason to
believe that a victory by the General Strike is far more probable
than a victory by either ballots or bullets. It must be admitted
however that its possibility is impaired by the insistent
promulgation by politicians, insurrectos and reformers of
non-industrial methods, just as it would be helped by an
aggressive educational campaign along revolutionary industrial
union lines. Unless a great effort is made to direct the growing
discontent of the working class along industrial lines for the
attainment of Industrial Democracy by means of the General Strike
many other things are likely to happen. The only other
alternatives appear to be mob disorders and dictatorship of one
kind or another. Workers should make every effort to get what
they want, but they should be mighty sure they want it.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="society" name="society"></a>The New
Society Not Inevitable</p>
<p>The capitalist system, rotten as it is, has resources which
cannot be overlooked. The armed forces of the state are not
nearly so formidable as the venal press and other avenues of
publicity and class mis-education. The capitalist press and
class-controlled radio are perhaps the very strongest bulwarks
for the established order. By means of these, labor hatred and
mob frenzy can be lashed to fever heat at any time and against
any individual or group which dares to challenge the capitalist
system. It will be recalled however that newspaper workers have
at times, notably in Seattle, refused to set-up or print
slanderous and inflammatory anti-labor editorial matter. So here
as well as in the manufacture and transportation of war material,
the economic power of the workers can be used to advantage.</p>
<p>The system of exploitation is still strongly entrenched and
deeply rooted in the economic ignorance as well as in the habits,
customs and imbecile individualism of the groove-minded
electorate. But regardless of these obvious advantages the
upholders of the present order are fighting a losing fight.
Capitalism has outlived its usefulness as a social system. It has
become a curse to the entire human race. There is no further
historical justification for its existence. It has become an
obstacle to further social progress. It is doomed by the iron law
of inexorable change. Just as chattel slavery yeilded to serfdom
and serfdom to wage-slavery, so the latter is forced by
evolutionary and revolutionary pressure to make way for
scientific industrialism-- Industrial Democracy. But even this is
not inevitable, for the present ruling class shows unmistakable
willingness to plunge the entire world into disorganization and
chaos. They may succeed unless steps are soon taken to stop
them.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="may" name="may"></a>Let Come What
May...</p>
<p>Already the world is a tumult of disorder and rebellion due to
starvation and misrule. No individial or organization can predict
with blue-print precision what course events may take in each of
the civilized countries, during the last days of the expiring
social order. All that we are able to see in the light of social
science is that the industries must be taken over by the ones who
use them and need them and be operated for use instead of profit.
The socialization of the means of production, transportation and
exchange is now necessary for the survival of the human race.
Only the workers are in a position to do this and it is their
duty AT ALL COSTS to see that it is done. Properly organized and
disciplined no power on earth can stop the aroused working class
from coming into its own.</p>
<p>The scientifically sound and thoroughly constructive character
of the I.W.W. program has never been stressed more forcibly than
in the concluding paragraphs of its Preamble:</p>
<blockquote>"It is the historic mission of the working class to
do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized
not only for the everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to
carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown.
By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the
new society within the shell of the old."</blockquote>
<p class="redbar"><a id="shall" name="shall"></a>"Labor Shall Be
All"</p>
<p>"Seize the industries," is at present a discredited slogan,
for, by inference, we are led to understand that this means to
seize the industries from the outside. But, frankly, is it
necessary for workers to "seize" something they already have?</p>
<p>Every day, on the job, workers are in possession of the
industries. The problem is not how to "seize" them, but how to
keep from giving them up. The scientific modern General Strike
would have a much simpler slogan and a much more sensible
program: For the employed: "Retain the industries, but refuse to
produce for profit." For the unemployed: "Picket the industries
and refuse to scab or to let anyone else scab."</p>
<p>It is vitally necessary for the present "owners" that
machinery and resources be manned by labor. It is equally
necessary, during the revolutionary transition, that labor refuse
to relinquish its hold on machinery either to "owners" or to
their scabs or mercenaries.</p>
<p>That labor will defend its own interests goes without saying.
The I.W.W. has taught and is teaching workers to fight, not to
beg-- to demand, not to plead for what they want. And in this
final struggle to free the world from social parasitism, courage,
clear-thinking and fearless fighting spirit are needed as never
before.</p>
<p>Realizing that the control of industry can only come into the
hands of the producing class when the producers have sufficient
power to keep and to hold this control, the I.W.W. advocates the
General Strike on the job reinforced by formidable, determined
revolutionary picket lines of unemployed. The change from private
to social ownership being inevitable, only thus can the danger of
serious destruction and bloodshed be minimized.</p>
<p>The workingclass should bend every effort to this end. The
full current of the revolutionary movement should be directed
from the streets to the industries. The revolutionary struggle
should be thought out and fought out in terms of industrial
action-- control, defense, operation. The class struggle, in the
last analysis, must be a struggle to control the means of
production, transportation and exchange. It will probably be a
bitter fight, but one that can have but one ending-- complete
victory for the workers in the world's industries.</p>
<p>Let come what may, no worker should count the cost. Even at
the worst a General Strike could scarcely entail more privation
and suffering than one of capitalism's many and all too frequent
depressions. The General Strike is saner than insurrection and
surer than political action. And beyond it-- after the storm-- is
a scientifically planned and ordered world based on peace, plenty
and security for martyrized humanity. What other thing is more
worth striving for by courageous men and women than the ideal of
this classless Industrial Democracy for which the I.W.W. has
battled so valorously and for so many years?</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
