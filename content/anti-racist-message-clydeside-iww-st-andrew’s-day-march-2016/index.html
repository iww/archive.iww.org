<p><strong>By Edinburgh Wobbly - <a target="_blank" href="https://iwwscotland.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/anti-racist-message-from-clydeside-iww-st-andrews-day-march-2016/">IWW Scotland</a>, November 25, 2016</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../../sites/default/files/images/iww-no-borders_0_0.jpg" align="right" alt="" />Now more than ever we need organising that is:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong>anti-racist</strong></li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong>anti-fascist</strong></li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong> internationalist.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory in the US elections, following the recent Brexit vote, creates a whole new political climate in the West.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, working class people have suffered a massive attack with the loss of traditional industries, in favour of low-paid service jobs, and the destruction of the labour movement.&nbsp; The neoliberal model that was created was based on growth through the financial sector and it led to the 2008 economic crisis.</p>
<p>When the UK government bailed out the banks it forced us to shoulder the cost through austerity, cutting vital services and targetting the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The left responded to post-crisis austerity first through mass protest around the world, and then the rise of several populist movements seeking parliamentary power.&nbsp; One by one, they have been defeated or have so far been unable to provide any real challenge.</p>
<p>And now things are about to get worse.</p>
<p>There are many uncertainties &ndash; what will Brexit mean? how will Trump govern?&nbsp; What we can expect in the UK is that austerity will go on, even if the aim is no longer to cut the deficit, and real wages &nbsp;will continue to decline.</p>
<p>Both Brexit and Trump&rsquo;s presidency are a victory for the far right.&nbsp; Immigration to the UK will be curbed and border controls will become even more cruel.&nbsp; Racism against ethnic minorities will be reinforced by the tabloid media as the nationalist dream fails to appear.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that <strong>migrants don&rsquo;t lower wages &ndash; bosses do</strong>.</p>
<p>From a capitalist perspective, immigration is essential for growth and running services like the NHS.&nbsp; It was never migration that caused a decline in living standards but capital&rsquo;s pursuit of profit through outsourcing and financialisation.</p>
<p>For many in Scotland, the prospect of a second Independence referendum is seen as the chance to escape the Brexit nightmare.&nbsp; But we shouldn&rsquo;t be complacent.</p>
<p>Scotland is unlikely to become independent before the UK leaves the European Union.&nbsp; The Scottish Government would then have to make even more cuts.&nbsp; And although the SNP are in favour of immigration, they want to control it with a points-based system which is likely to become more strict as times goes on.</p>
<p>Across Europe, including the Nordic countries which many Scots wish to emulate, we have seen the growth in popularity of anti-immigrant and far right parties.</p>
<p>Against the squeezing of working class living standards, and the racist divisions created among us, we should not trust in a &lsquo;better nationalism&rsquo; whose social democratic facade is fading.&nbsp; We need a return of militancy and of workers&rsquo; solidarity across borders.</p>
<h3><strong>What can we do?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Migrant solidarity</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already important groups in Glasgow, run from the bottom up, who provide solidarity to all migrants.&nbsp; <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://unitycentreglasgow.org/">The Unity Centre</a></strong>&nbsp;offers practical support and advice to asylum seekers and migrants, including those detained in UK Detention Centres.&nbsp; They receive no funding and would really welcome your donation.&nbsp; You can also train to volunteer there, or support their appeals to protest deportations.</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/wewillriseglasgow">We will rise</a> </strong>is a group of asylum seekers, migrants, and allies who campaign to end immigration detention in the UK.&nbsp; They have organised several protests at Dungavel Detention Centre and we can expect more in the future.&nbsp; The UK government&rsquo;s plan to build a new detention centre at Glasgow Airport was recently rejected by councillors after protests.&nbsp; We need to make sure that any new attempts to build detention centres are stopped, and that resistance to detention is increased.</p>
<p>You can also provide accommodation for refugees, even if only for a short time, by contacting groups such as <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.paih.org/">Positive Action in Housing</a></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resisting the far right</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to take seriously the growth of the far right.&nbsp; This covers everything from the more &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; anti-immigration politics like UKIP to actual fascist groups.&nbsp; In this climate, their message will be amplified if we don&rsquo;t resist them.</p>
<p>We must respect that a diversity of tactics will be used to counter them, including the usual marches, as well as disrupting their meetings and direct action.&nbsp; Left groups and workers&rsquo; organisations should work from below to co-ordinate effective actions, rather than allowing any one front organisation to dominate.&nbsp; We should also challenge the tabloid media who fuel a hatred of migrants, and support alternative grassroots media.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organise</li>
</ul>
<p>However difficult it can sometimes feel, the most important thing we can do is to organise as workers in our workplaces, and in our communities, for concrete demands.&nbsp; It is through militant &nbsp;collective action, without relying on bureaucrats or politicians, that we will bring about real change.&nbsp; Without regaining our power to disrupt capitalism we will be defenceless, and even &lsquo;social democratic&rsquo; electoralism will be under no pressure to provide the reforms it promised.</p>
<p>But we shouldn&rsquo;t wait for an election or a referendum sometime in the future for the changes we need now.&nbsp; Our demands should be universal:&nbsp; homes for all, sanctuary for all, food for all, properly funded healthcare for everyone &ndash; whether you are a &lsquo;citizen&rsquo; or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; What&rsquo;s stopping us?</p>
<p>Capitalism is internationalist, and so should our resistance be.&nbsp; The stronger our links with militant workers across Europe and around the world, with the capacity to block supply chains and spread our struggles, the more of a threat we&rsquo;ll be.</p>
