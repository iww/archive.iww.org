<p><strong>Production Services Collective declaration to the ownership of Sound Stage Systems:</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="320" align="right" src="../../sites/default/files/images/IWWBalloonWindow.jpg" alt="" />For nearly a year, as fellow workers, we have organized ourselves, put forth proposals, met and negotiated with you, the ownership and management of Sound Stage Systems. We have done these things in an attempt to create a democratic work place and a functional system of working that is inclusive, promotes creativity, compensates fairly and sees the value in cooperation rather than the unsustainable spiral of competition.</p>
<p>Our proposals have been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm and hostility. Weekly staff meetings have been attempted and some proposals implemented. Some workers have negotiated better wages on a one on one basis only to find the overtime they expected was now unattainable. Profit over substance has become the mode of operation. Clients' needs have been swept aside as cost over runs are hurriedly &ldquo;funded&rsquo; and new avenues of profit are exploited. New hires have been intimidated with the threat of firing during probation periods. Workers old and new have been &ldquo;talked to&rdquo; regarding trivial matters in an apparent attempt to intimidate. An atmosphere of intolerance for dissenting views, alternate methods, procedures and social/work culture is present daily.</p>
<p>We find ourselves in a continuous cycle of emotional and economic boom and bust. Daily we experience the torturous trickle down from a system that disregards our contributions and rights to self-determination and fair compensation. We have determined the only way out of this cycle and into routine control of our lives and movement forward lies in solidarity with workers locally and around the world who struggle daily to form the structures of a new way to work and live within the shell of the old.</p>
<p>It is with this in mind that we proudly declare ourselves members of the Industrial Workers of the World and move to build a work environment that fairly addresses the needs of client, worker and owner.</p>
<p>Before we can continue work on existing projects and before the discussion of work on new projects, we demand that you, the ownership and management of Sound Stage Systems, recognize us, the workers of Sound Stage Systems, as members of IWW IU630 (The Industrial Workers of the World, industrial union 630) and allow us the space to create a more democratic work place.</p>
<p>With a fresh prospective from this new owner/worker dynamic, we can discuss the details of the following additional demands;</p>
<ul>
<li>1) that as members of IWW IU630 we are given access to and input in every aspect of our role as workers on any project.</li>
<li>2) That as members of IWW IU630 we are the first to be responsible for the training, review and assignment to departments of any member or new hire for any project.</li>
<li>3) That as members of IWW IU630 we receive equal pay for equal work based on a four tier pay scale.</li>
<li>4) That travel project notifications will be a minimum of two weeks prior to booking.</li>
<li>5) That an open system for review and conflict resolution is established with no less than two IWW IU630 members present at any meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are no longer willing to participate in or make excuses for substandard work that is produced by a system beyond our control. We are dedicated to providing the best products and services in this industry. Within this new framework we are confident we can achieve this and create a work environment that will elevate every project Sound Stage System involves itself in, to this level and beyond.</p>
