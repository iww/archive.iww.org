<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>Webster defines the word 'weapon' as, "any instrument of
offense or defense." Surely the machinery of production is
capable of being used for offense and defense both by the
employing and the working class. Every strike, every lockout
proves that the control and operation of modern machinery has
developed a new technique of warfare as well as the most powerful
weapons the world has ever known. We are trying to show that
control of this machinery is the weapon which gives the employing
class dominion over all the world, and that use of this machinery
gives the working class ultimate power over the so-called
owners.</p>
<p>The invention of gunpowder altered the course of human history
and so did the steam engine, airplane and radio. Military science
concedes that the factory behind the lines is as important as the
human cannon-fodder in the trenches for the winning of a war. God
is no longer on the side of of the strongest batallions, as
Napoleon said. He is now on the side of the most perfectly
organized industries. Workers should keep in mind that the real
weapons of the machine age are the machines themselves.</p>
<p>It has frequently been stated that in the next war there will
be no non-combatants. This is but another way of saying that the
machine is as potent a weapon as the cannon. Military forces are
worse than useless unless they are supplied with food, supplies
and transportation. Both in warfare and industry the individual
counts less and the mass more. Individual power is nothing,
collective power, everything. An army in battle that is not
organized is merely a mob. Workers in industry who are not
organized are in the same category. They must be organized by
their technical directors and foremen in order to produce
efficiently. They must organize themselves into industrial
unions, just as they are grouped in the industries, if they ever
hope to use the weapon of economic power in their own behalf.</p>
<p>The day of the small war or the small strike is gone forever.
Labor, without organization and disciplined solidarity, without
unity and singleness of purpose must of necessity remain in its
traditional rut. Labor cannot emancipate itself until it learns
to use the mighty weapons which contact with the machinery of
production has placed in its hands.</p>
<center><img src="../../graphics/agitators/modern/others/factory_strike.jpg" /></center>
<p class="redbar"><a id="revolutions" name="revolutions"></a>Revolutions, Old and New</p>
<p>The onward march of the machine process has not only changed
the method and tactics of warfare, it has also changed our
concept of the methods and tactics of revolution. It has done
this by making old weapons obsolete and by making new weapons
available. Warfare used to be an art; now it is an industry. The
ancient art of arms is now practiced chiefly for sport. Nowadays
a nation does not settle down to the grim business of war until
the wheels of industry start turning.</p>
<p>The onward march of the machine process has completely changed
our concept of the methods and tactics of revolution. Modern
airplanes, poison and incendiary gas, artillery and machine guns
in the hands of highly trained specialists have put the unarmed
and practically untrained worker at a decided disadvantage in the
matter of military combat. But even if the odds were equal it
would be an act of folly for workers in any highly industrialized
country to take as their models the classical revolutions of
1848, the French Revolution, the Paris Commune, or, even Russia.
Labor's power has been transferred from the street to the
industry. Job action has displaced the outpouring of the people
and the picket line the barricades. The supreme act of the
present revolution will not be the raising of the red flag over
the old town hall, but rather the continued and orderly operation
of the machinery of production, transportation and exchange by
the industrial workers functioning just as they function now;
only involving a complete lockout of the parasite class and its
upholders. The General Strike to break the final hold of the
Parasites in Industry!</p>
<p>This is the modern alignment in the world-wide struggle of the
working class to free itself from the curse of wage slavery and
exploitation. The revolution of our day will be an industrial
struggle and the weapons, to be effective, must be industrial
weapons.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="point" name="point"></a>The Point of
Production</p>
<p>Cannons, airplanes, submarines, mines and machine guns are
designed for the use of capitalist class mercenaries. Such
weapons are hardly suitable for the modern economic struggle to
determine whether the workers or the parasites shall control
industry. Here the fight takes place at the point of production
and the workers have this one big advantage in the struggle: they
are the producing army of industry. The machines are utterly
valueless without the brawn and brain of the men who tend
them.</p>
<p>The workers are stationed strategically in industry. Unlike
the profit-grabbing "owners" they are an indispensable part of
the industrial process. Workers are at the machines because they
are needed to keep those machines in operation. By sheer force of
numbers they already have possession of the industries. They are
trained in the use of the machinery of production, transportation
and exchange, upon which all the devices of warfare are
dependent. In addition to this the workers' cause, having for its
objective the extension of human happiness, has the approval of
all right thinking people as compared with the cause of the Kept
Class which of necessity can have no other objective save that of
the continuation of social parasitism. The workers' power is
greater therefore than the power of the capitalist class and its
war-like mercenaries.</p>
<p>Capitalism can continue only so long as the working class
ignorantly gives its consent and approval. The exploitation of
the many by the few can continue only so long as the many do not
know any better than to submit to exploitation. This approval or
disapproval can nowhere be expressed so forcibly as in industry
where the exploitation takes place. The General Strike will
therefore be Labor's economic rejection of its economic
enslavement.</p>
<p>Individually under capitalism the wage worker is weaponless.
If he has a job and doesn't like it he can quit. If he doesn't
have a job he can crawl into an alley and die of starvation. Also
he is free to drink himself to death or to take poison or end it
all with a bullet, thus doing the master class a favor. Any other
private war or revolt of his own against the system is generally
classified somewhere between the meaning of the two words,
'misdemeanor' and 'felony.'</p>
<p>The hope of the modern wage slave is in numbers. In class
warfare only collective weapons count. He can have strength
himself only by combining his individual strength with the massed
strength of his fellow workers in industry. The class struggle
demands class weapons. Fortunately his position in class society
has forced the wage slave to think in terms of 'we' instead of
terms of 'I.'</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="attitudes" name="attitudes"></a>Fighting
Attitudes</p>
<p>The modern wage-slave has been trained to think of power in
terms of numbers. In contrast to the craftsmen of old times,
whose outlook was of necessity limited to that of the individual
or the craft, the industrial worker of today is forced to view
his troubles from the standpoint of the industry in which he is
employed. If he has intelligence at all he can see at once that
his personal problem in industry is identically the same as the
thousands of workers who are employed in the same plant.
Instinctively, when confronted with the greed and ferocity of the
exploiting class he thinks not in terms of voting, shooting,
bombing and bayoneting (as his masters do), but in terms of
striking.</p>
<p>This was true in the beginning when industry was small and it
is true today. The only difference is that it is more difficult
and takes longer to communicate the impulse of motion to a large
object than to a small object. A small strike in the early days
of capitalism was a comparatively simple thing. Any strike today
under super-capitalism is bound to be bigger and more
complicated. The strike impulse, instead of being communicated to
dozens or hundreds of men, is comminicated to thousands or
hundreds of thousands. This impulse, due to the checks and
controls encouraged by the employers, may not always succeed in
putting the large mass into action. But the impulse is always
there and, in the end, large strikes are as inevitable as small
strikes ever were.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="consciousness" name="consciousness"></a>Job Consciousness and Class
Consciousness</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/agitators/modern/others/strike_chalkboard.jpg" align="right" /> From job consciousness to class consciousness,
from job action to industrial action, from the job strike to the
General Strike is only a matter of degree. Every strike under
modern industrial condition, is a General Strike in embryo. Even
the proposed decentralization of industry will merely alter the
tactics and strategy of the General Strike. It will in no sense
do away with the will of the workers to use the strike as a
weapon of ever increasing importance in the class struggle. On
the other hand it will weaken the position of the master class by
giving them perhaps a dozen heavily picketed scab plants, where
they now have but one, to be guarded by their limited army of
mercenaries when the great struggle is finally under way.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much political dissatisfaction may exist at
any given time the worker's bed-rock complaint against capitalism
will continue to be economic. He is robbed at the point of
production and at the point of production he must fight against
continued exploitation. If it can be shown that anything at all
can be done by means of political action to make the workers'
struggle easier so much the better. But workers must not delude
themselves about the efficacy of political action. No matter how
red they vote on election day or whom they elect to office they
will discover that their power struggle is but the shadow of
their struggle in industry.</p>
<p>The danger of overstressing the importance of political action
lies in the fact that the workers are thereby led to trust
someone else (usually not a member of the working class) to do
something for them which, with a little understanding and
determination, they could have done a whole lot easier by
themselves-- and without the danger of betrayal. Confidence in
political action not only robs the worker of the initiative for
independent action, it also leads him into that state of mind
where he is willing to exchange one kind of dictatorship for
another. The ultimate aim of the General Strike is not to
substitute for the yoke of capitalism, the yoke of the red
republican<sup>1</sup>, the fascist, the militarist--or any other
yoke. The General Strike can just as well be used by the workers
to institute real industrial freedom and democracy and to do away
with all yokes save that of necessary social labor which is in
the common obligation of everybody born into the world.</p>
<p>[<sup>1</sup>] <u>i.e. state communist.</u></p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="evolution" name="evolution"></a>Evolution of Industrial Power</p>
<p>In the beginning of the capitalist era the craftsmen were
hired either individually or in small groups by the individual
employer or partnership. At that time there was no vast and
highly specialized industries such as exist today. Neither were
there centralized ownership and control of entire industries by a
handful of plutocrats operating through interlocking directorates
such as we know at present. The plant was a small plant, the boss
a small boss and the strike, of necessity, a small strike.</p>
<p>But the small plants did not stay small. With the growth of
population and the ripening of the capitalist system they became
bigger and bigger. They were merged and consolidated under
pressure of economic necessity. They became vast industries. The
small shop became a factory, the weaving room a textile mill, the
village smithy a foundry. Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit arose
in all their dismal might and the tentacles of Wall Street
reached to the remotest corners of the land. All the while there
were fewer and fewer employers and vaster aggregations of
wage-slaves. The actual direction and management of industry
passed from the absentee owner to the hired technician and both
technician and worker toiled to satisfy the insatiable greed for
profits of the entrepeneur and the absentee parasite class.</p>
<p>Of course, it was not as simple as it appears but, in a
general way, strikes became larger and the industrial power of
the working class proportionately greater. The line-up in the
class struggle was no longer between the small employer and the
small group of workers but between workers in entire industrial
areas and numerically smaller but infinitely more powerful
corporations. The mines, mills and factories spread like a plague
of vast prisons over the land. And the day of the small strike or
small union was gone forever.</p>
<p>All this would have been well if the conscious power of the
working class had grown in proportion to the growth of industry.
Machinery did not perceptibly lift the burden of toil from the
shoulders of the working class; it simply increased the profits
of the parasite owners. The grievances of the wage-slaves became
greater and their strikes bigger and ever more bitterly
contested.</p>
<p>In capitalist society the acceleration of the machine process
not only changes the way men are grouped together in ordetr to
work, it also changes the way they group themselves in order to
fight. In each country workers react to the class struggle
according to the maturity or immaturity of the machine process in
that country. This accounts for the fact that combative
proletarian tactics suitable for instance to a comparatively
backward land like Russia, are of little value to workers under a
highly advanced industrial system like the one prevailing in
North America. This also explains why the I.W.W.-- the world's
outstanding exponent of revolutionary industrial unionism--
originated in the U.S.A. where capitalism had reached its most
mature and perfect form.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
