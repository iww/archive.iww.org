<p>The puropse of industrial unionism is to give the working
class the greatest possible organized power in industry.
Unquestionably the General Strike, either on or off the job, is
the most perfect manifestation of this power. If the craft unions
of today are examined in regard to their adaptability to this end
it will put the revolutionary industrial union movement in an
entirely new light. Also it will reveal clearly the shortcomings
of conventional unionism in general and the craft union movement
in particular. After all, the full measure of power is the acid
test of any labor organization.</p>
<p>A cursory glance at the craft union movement will reveal the
fact that it is constructed in such a way as to divide rather
than to unify the forces of labor. The craft union is not
designed to enable labor to use its full power. This type of
union came into existence during the period of industrial
evolution known as small production when the tools of the craft
and the skill of the craftsman were important things. In those
days the organized power of the tradesman consisted in his having
monopoly on the skill necessary to make the tools of his trade
industrially productive. The withdrawal of this skill during
periods of strikes was all that was necessary to force the
old-time employer of labor to terms. Thus it happened that the
craft union was organized around the, then important, tools of
the tradesmen.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="obsolete" name="obsolete"></a>Tools and
Skills Obsolete</p>
<p>But all this has been changed. The onward march of the machine
process has to a large extent made both tools and skill
unnecessary. This great advance in technical development has made
the old fashioned trades union unable to cope with modern
conditions. Craft unions still carry on as a matter of habit, it
is true, but they are anachronisms in this modern world. Some of
them merely serve as pie-cards for the tired business men who are
their officials and all such unions serve more or less as props
of the existing order. But they are not unions in the modern
sense at all. They are merely the shells of once useful unions
operating to secure advantages for a few favored groups of
workers without regard to the interests of the working class as a
whole. They are organized within the capitalist system which they
have been taught to take for granted, and they have no thought or
program of anything beyond this system.</p>
<p>In relation to the manifest weakness of the trade union
structure and concept the I.W.W. Preamble points out with telling
emphasis:</p>
<blockquote>"We find that the centering of the management of
industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trades unions
unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing
class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows
one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in
the same industry, thereby helping to defeat one another in wage
wars. Moreover the trade unions aid the employing class to
mislead the workers into the belief that the workers have
interests in common with their employers."</blockquote>
<p class="redbar"><a id="notcraft" name="notcraft"></a>Labor's
Problem is Industrial, Not Craft</p>
<p>Labor's problem today is not a craft but an industrial
problem. A labor union at the present time, to be an effectual
instrument of offense and defense, must conform to the structure
of modern industry. It must be industrial rather than craft in
form. But the craft unions have not kept pace with the needs of a
changing world. They have very largely remained just where they
were in the beginning. Far from being the helpful fighting
instruments they were in the old days, they have now become
merely a further means of effecting the enslavement of the class
whose interests they are supposed to serve.</p>
<p>A General Strike of craft unions is an unthinkable
impossibility. Being organized for the sole purpose of enabling a
few groups of workers to "get by" under capitalism, they lack
both the form and the spirit necessary to make possible united
action for a common objective against a common foe. For this
reason, as organized today, they would be of very doubtful help
to any unified effort of the working class to free itself from
wage slavery by industrial means. The modern industrial struggle
demands modern industrial weapons. And in this regard the craft
union is as obsolete as the dodo. Workers who conceive of the
final struggle for emancipation in terms of industrial power will
have to look elsewhere for an organizational form more suitable
for this purpose.</p>
<p>The so-called independent industrial unions are in the same
category. It is true their rather loose industrial structure
makes it possible for them to think of their union in terms of a
given industry. But, as in the case of the U.M.W. of A. [United
Mine Workers of America] and other similar unions, they are
divided into districts if not in crafts and are tied down by
contracts which make it impossible for them to act in unison. In
no case is there evidence of any attempt or desire on their part
to ally themselves for the purposes of solidarity with transport
or other workers on One Big Union lines. Organized railroad,
clothing and many other workers in the U.S.A. are similarly
bound, similarly divided and similarly unable to get together for
united action of any sort.</p>
<p>As far as the interests of Labor are concerned these steps
must be in the right direction. They must not only be distinctly
industrial, they must also be unquestionably revolutionary.</p>
<blockquote>"Instead of the conservative motto, 'A fair day's
wage for a fair day's work,' we must inscribe on our banner the
revolutionary watchword, Abolition of the wage
system."</blockquote>
<p>So states the I.W.W. Preamble. And in this historic slogan is
found the source of the strength and inspiration of the organized
industrial workers of all the world.</p>

<p class="redbar"><a id="parties" name="parties"></a>Political
Parties and the General Strike</p>
<p>Working class political parties, while not unanimous in
endorsing the General Strike, are frank in admitting the need for
economic power in any program of revolutionary reconstruction.
Socialists and Communists alike seem to recognize the importance
of industrial unionism but they don't do much about it. They
can't. Political parties are not organized that way.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion however, particularly in Europe,
both Socialists and Communists have appealed to the workers for a
General Strike. This is a thing which is more than likely to
happen again. The trouble is that these organizations, being
political parties and not labor unions, lack the machinery to put
a General Strike into effect. After all other measures fail they
issue frantic appeals for what they should have thought about in
the first place-- industrial solidarity. Usually they are forced
to appeal to more or less unsympathetic conservative unions with
which their contact has been largely nominal. Such unions,
neither in structure nor spirit were designed to respond
effectively to such demand.</p>
<p>A planned and consciously modern structure is as necessary for
the labor union as is a planned economy for society as a whole.
To expect <i>class</i> action from a <i>trades</i> union is at
least as foolish as to expect revolutionary planks in a
conservative party platform. This haphazard and hit-or-miss
method of making eleventh-hour appeals for a General Strike does
not indicate the strongest possible confidence in the efficacy of
political action. The efforts of the politically-minded
Socialists and Communists of Germany in 1932 to call a General
Strike in order to forestall Fascism is an example in point.
After 1914 they should have known better and should, long since,
have prepared for such an emergency by forgetting about the game
of politics long enough to build up a powerful industrial
movement along One Big Union lines. Then the story would have
been vastly different from what it is today.</p>
<p>The I.W.W. from its inception has held before the workers the
goal of industrial democracy to be obtained by means of the
General Strike. The Preamble, of which hundreds of millions of
copies have been circulated, states in unmistakable terms:</p>
<blockquote>"These conditions can be changed and the interests of
the working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a
way that all its members in any one industry, or in all
industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout
is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an
injury to all."</blockquote>
<p>Has ever a statement appeared indicating more clearly the
organic interdependence, unity and potential power of the world's
producers?</p>
<p>In spite of certain misleading surface similarities, which are
unduly stressed by shallow observers, the European
anarcho-syndicalist movement and the I.W.W. differ considerably
in more than one particular. This was made inevitable by reason
of the fact that the I.W.W. was the result of a later and more
mature period of industrial development.</p>
<p>This accounts for the fact that European Syndicalism, unlike
the I.W.W., is not organized into One Big Union on the basis of
perfectly co-ordinated, centralized industrial departments. It
also accounts for the fact that the form of the I.W.W. is
designed to serve not only as a powerful combative force in the
everyday class struggle, but also as the structure of the new
society both as regards production and administration.
Incidentally the I.W.W. concept of the General Strike differs
almost as much from that of the anarcho-syndicalist as from that
of the political or craft unionist. In form, structure and
objective, the I.W.W. is more all-sufficient, more mature and
more modern than any of its anarcho-syndicalist predecessors.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="technicians" name="technicians"></a>Technicians and the I.W.W.</p>
<p>It may be objected that the I.W.W. has not contacted and
co-operated with the technicians to the extent that the European
Syndicalists have done. If this is true at all it is due not to
any lack of appreciation of the importance of the technician in
the industrial organism but rather the fact that the I.W.W. has
been embattled in the American class struggle to an extent which
has made sustained contact difficult.</p>
<p>The I.W.W. has always held the technician as a vitally
necessary member of the producing class. He is indispensable to
any program of fundamental economic reconstruction. His place, in
the One Big Union Chart, corresponds to his place and his
importance in industry. The I.W.W. conceives of Industrial
Democracy as the technological managerial forces cooperating with
the working productive forces of the army of industry under the
General Administration of the One Big Union in the interests of
the entire human race. Practically from its inception the I.W.W.
has welcomed the engineer into its councils. Some of its
outstanding educators have been technically trained men. The
non-political, anti-entrepeneur, industrially-minded engineer has
always been recognized by the I.W.W. as a blood brother. In 1921
an attempt was made by the I.W.W. to build up a Bureau of
Industrial Research under the direction of a clear-thinking group
of capable engineers with both social vision and a sense of
social responsibility. This ambitious project the I.W.W. was
forced to abandon because so many of its active officials had at
that time been sent to prison. Prior to that time and since, the
I.W.W. has preached and practiced that type of disciplined
solidarity which, according to the technician, is so vitally
necessary to any plan of carrying on production exclusive of the
profit-grabbing Captains of Finance.</p>
<p>The I.W.W. is in full agreement with and committed, by a
policy of nearly a half of a century, to the idea that workers
and engineers are the only indispensable elements in modern
productive processes. The technician is in every sense of the
word a fellow worker. He is the "other self" of the man at the
machine-- the managerial technological force in industry which
counterpoints the productive working forces in the army of
production. Both are equally necessary to any plan of carrying on
production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. Both are
equally necessary to any plan of putting an end to the profit
system by means other than those of bloodshed and destruction.
This point looms big in the I.W.W. doctrine of the General
Strike. It is well for technicians, I.W.W. menbers, and students
generally to keep it in mind.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="common" name="common"></a>Real Rebels
Meet on Common Ground</p>
<p>Nothing could be more natural than this bond of fellowship
between the I.W.W. and other industrially minded groups in the
army of production or among working class movements. It has been
shown that craft and independent industrial unions make the
attainment and use of Labor's full economic power impossible or
difficult of attainment. It has also been shown that
revolutionary political parties, apart from educational and
defensive activities, complicate rather than simplify the
situation as far as the General Strike is concerned. Therefore
the I.W.W. appeals to the workers in the world's industries to
put aside prejudices and differences of opinion as to race,
color, religion or politics and unite their economic power into
One Big Union regardless of national boundary lines in order to
put a final end to the hideous monster of world Imperialism which
has enslaved and degraded the workers of every nation. The
General Strike is ONE program on which all wage workers should
agree.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
