 <title>Chevron: Actively preventing a transition to renewable energy.</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWEUC_0.jpg&quot; /&gt;In 1950, Chevron, General Motors, and Firestone were charged and convicted of criminal conspiracy for their part in the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy&quot;&gt;General Motors streetcar conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;. In this scandal they purchased streetcar systems all over the United States in order to disassemble the industry and create bus lines. They did this to increase the demand for petroleum, automobiles and tires so that they could directly receive business and profits from their scheme. &amp;nbsp;Later Chevron began investing in alternative industries such as lithium car batteries. Chevron began to be limiting access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses. Many suspect they did this to remove a competitor to gasoline and suspicions were affirmed when Chevron began a lawsuit against &lt;a style=&quot;text-decoration:

 <title>Reinventing the Wheel - The REAL Green Jobs Story</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/reinventing-wheel-real-green-jobs-story</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWEUC_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By x356039 - May 2, 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The views expressed here are not the official  position of the IWW (or even the IWW&amp;rsquo;s EUC) and do not necessarily  represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the accepted limits of debate in Washington and Wall Street the main argument by proponents of the fossil fuel industry is the same as its always been: do you want to protect the environment or create more jobs? They argue expanding fossil fuel exploitation, in spite of the proven risks to the environment and public health, is necessary for the sake of job creation. By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57361212/keystone-pipeline-how-many-jobs-really-at-stake/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;building Keystone XL&lt;/a&gt; across the Great Plains, &lt;a href=&quot;http://trib.com/business/energy/environmental-groups-halt-new-powder-river-basin-coal-mining/article_35d8f21e-dc69-5bea-80aa-a65dd8a88a02.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coaldiver.org/coal-diver/Powder-River&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Powder River Basin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/03/wyoming-coal-leases-powder-river-basin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coal interests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/08/offshore-drilling-increase-access-reduce-the-risk-and-stop-hurting-american-companies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nola.com/politics.ssf/2012/07/house_approves_bill_to_greatly.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;offshore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324020504578398610851042612.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drilling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/fracking-revolution-more-jobs-cheaper-energy-worth-manageable-171414515.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opening up&lt;/a&gt; new lands to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midwestenergynews.com/2013/01/10/u-s-chambers-fracking-job-boom-behind-the-numbers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fracking&lt;/a&gt; the fossil fuel dinosaurs claim our economy will recover &amp;amp; energy independence will be achieved. When confronted with the facts on clean energy sources like wind and solar power fossil fuel proponents argue &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cato.org/policy-report/marchapril-2011/high-cost-green-jobs-green-energy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clean energy is too expensive&lt;/a&gt;. They claim it would not be cost-effective to build a green energy economy and that it would lead to a decline in standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite contrary to the boldest of claims made by those dinosaurs the facts show shifting to a clean energy economy would create more jobs, cost less money, and easily exceed all performance needs. Research by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rael.berkeley.edu/greenjobs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Renewable &amp;amp; Appropriate Energy Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; at University of California, Berkeley shows the fossil fuel industry&#039;s claims of better job creation rates compared to green, clean energy are vastly overblown. As shown in this chart below renewable energy sources produce as many if not more jobs per megawatt of capacity as traditional dirty sources of electricity:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The IWW And Earth First!: Part 1 - Establishing Roots </title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-and-earth-first-part-1-establishing-roots</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By X344543 - &lt;i&gt;Industrial Worker&lt;/i&gt;, May 1988. Dedicated to Franklin Rosemont, Carlos Cortez, and Utah Phillips.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWMay1988.jpg&quot; /&gt;Judi Bari was both an Earth First!er and a Wobbly from 1988 to 1993 and during that time there was a close alliance between the two organizations. Although some assume she brought the two together, the truth is more complex. When Judi Bari joined Earth First! and the IWW in the summer of 1988, Earth First!ers and Wobblies were already discussing the idea of forging an alliance. There are many reasons for this, but the overarching explanation is that Earth First! and the IWW are really different manifestations of thesame revolutionary impulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/iww-and-earth-first-part-1-establishing-roots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Capital Blight: It&#039;s Past Time to Get Off the Coal Train.</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/capital-blight-its-past-time-get-coal-train</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Steve Ongerth - April 24, 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW (or even the IWW&amp;rsquo;s EUC) and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWEUC_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;A recent debate took place on my personal Facebook page regarding the matter of jobs and the environment, and there is little doubt that it will not be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may (or may not) be aware, I have been combing various environmental and labor news sources for stories about campaigns where class struggle and environmentalism have some degree of intersection (or conflict, though the latter is almost always manufactured vy the capitalist class). Most of these I have been posting on the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecology.iww.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IWW Environmental Unionism Caucus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;, but since much of that happens while the only means of information transfer is a smart phone, so often, due to the limitations of smartphone apps, I have to engage in some klunky work-arounds, and sometimes that means that certain bits of information wind up on my personal page first, but I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I happened upon a statement from a BLET engineer downplaying the dangers of coal dust drifting from coal trains passing through the southern part of the Seattle metropolitan area, and I immediately regarded this as the thoughts of a scissorbill and I said as much. That statement drew a response from another individual, a Facebook &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; (a former Wobbly turned low-level ILWU leader, by the way), telling me that the coal dust issue was overstated, that the Sierra Club--who was leading the opposition to coal trains there--was hypocritical (due to the latter&#039;s having accepted donations from capitalist Natural Gas interests), and that I was insufficiently &amp;quot;solidaric&amp;quot; with my (business) union brothers and sisters. He informed me that the Sierra Club was only canvassing well-to-do neighborhoods in the area and completely ignoring those working class neighborhoods closest to the potential route, which--by the way--had far more immediate and far more serious environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am a transportation worker by trade (I&#039;m a ferryboat deckhand, iu510 you know), I figured I might have fired before aiming, so I decided to dig a little further (pun not intended) and see just what was up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needn&#039;t have held my fire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Capital Blight - Green Illusions or Malthusian Miasma?</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/capital-blight-green-illusions-or-malthusian-miasma</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Steve Ongerth - April 17, 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW (or even the IWW&amp;rsquo;s EUC) and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://truth-out.org/news/item/15588-power-shift-away-from-green-illusions&quot;&gt;item on truth-out.org&lt;/a&gt;, published on April 8, 2013, features an interview by Steve Horn of Ozzie Zehner, author of the book &lt;u&gt;Green Illusions: the Dirty Secrets of Clean Energy and the Future of Environmentalism&lt;/u&gt; . Titled, &amp;ldquo;Power Shift Away from Green Illusions&amp;rdquo; the interview would have been more appropriately named, &amp;ldquo;Deep Dive into a Vat of Malthusian Miasma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviewee, author Ozzie Zehner, argues that the public is being offered a false choice between fossil fuel based civilization and a renewable energy / clean tech based alternative, and that &amp;ldquo;most environmentalists&amp;rdquo; have &amp;ldquo;jumped on board the bandwagon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/capital-blight-green-illusions-or-malthusian-miasma&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
