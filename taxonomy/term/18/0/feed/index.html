 <title>Activism: Local sweatshop protesters take the fight statewide</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4313</link>
 <description>&lt;span class=&quot;ContentByLine&quot;&gt;BY &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Archive?author=oid%3A41384&quot; title=&quot;Click here for Adam Fleming archives&quot;&gt;ADAM 
FLEMING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU410/GhangiClemente72.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
Earlier this month, Gov. Ed Rendell endorsed an interstate effort to better 
enforce anti-sweatshop policies. Pennsylvania is the first state to pledge its 
support for a proposed anti-sweatshop consortium, made up of states, counties 
and municipalities from across the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Rendell has taken the leadership of states nationally,&amp;quot; says Kenneth Miller, 
who has long been active in local anti-sweatshop campaigns. &amp;quot;He requires the 
disclosure of factory locations. He requires wage disclosure. And he&#039;s taking 
the leadership in consolidating that information with different 
jurisdictions.&amp;quot;

 <title>Stonemountain Workers Score 3-year Contract, Raises, Healthcare!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4301</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/IU410/committee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workers and management at Stonemountain &amp;amp; Daughter, a Berkley California based Fabric Store, have signed a new contract.  Tentative agreement on the contract was reached in the final bargaining session on the night of June 26th, the shop vote was unanimous in favor of the contract, and the contract was officially ratified on July 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains for all the workers in the shop are huge: a raise in the starting wage from $9.25 per hour to $10.60 per hour, employer funded health care for employees working over 24 hours per week, a 35% raise in paid time off, new holidays, and even an easy chair in the break room.  In a win for the campaign to retain the eight hour day, all overtime is now guaranteed to be voluntary, meaning that anyone who chooses to work only eight hours cannot be disciplined for refusing overtime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Written on Martin Luther King Day 2008 for my friends attending the 10th Annual Summit Against Racism&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Greetings from Durban South Africa to all participants in the 10th Annual Summit Against Racism on January 26 at the East Liberty Presbyterian Church.  I made my home in Pittsburgh for many years. I came to Pittsburgh after organizing interracial athletic leagues is Apartheid South Africa and then challenging the International Olympic Committee to ban Apartheid South Africa from the Olympic Games. &lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Disappointment and Tough Questions for the  Pittsburgh Sports and Exhibition Authority</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3740</link>
 <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/IU410/mayday.jpg&quot; /&gt;For Immediate Release&lt;br /&gt;October 31, 2007&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Kenneth Miller 412-241-1339&lt;br /&gt;Download files at &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;www.iww.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, November 1 10:30 AM - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pittsburghcc.com/html.htm&quot;&gt;David L. Lawrence Convention Center&lt;/a&gt;, 3rd Floor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thursday Sports and Exhibition Authority meeting has been rescheduled twice already. If you plan to attend, please call the SEA (412-393-0200) on Thursday morning to confirm the meeting time. You can ask to be included you on a list of people who are notified about meeting time changes. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The Pirates have refused to accept the most basic responsibility for factories sewing apparel with the Pirates logo and, with Major League Baseball, made bogus assertions about their own social responsibility. &amp;nbsp; The SEA Executive Director Mary Conturo clearly understands this but has failed to adequately explain to the Board.&amp;nbsp; John Chalovich said at the last meeting that he &amp;quot;does not think the Pirates are using sweatshops&amp;quot; and that he &amp;quot;wishes&amp;quot; all Pirates merchandise was made in the United States. The actionable item for the SEA is to invite the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC)to Pittsburgh and accept its testimony about factories sewing Pirates apparel.&amp;nbsp; The WRC is the Human Rights organization founded with the help of United Students Against Sweatshops that conducts factory monitoring without financial support of the apparel industry. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Pittsburgh Pirates have failed to engage in a forthright dialogue, The Pittsburgh Anti Sweatshop Community Alliance (PASCA) asked the City Controller to investigate ways that the team can be held accountable to Pittsburghers. &amp;nbsp; Deputy Controller Pokora released an audit on October 21 that answered some of our questions.&amp;nbsp; The most important aspect of the&amp;nbsp;Controller&#039;s audit is that the City has NO checks and balances to ensure that the team is accountable to our shared concerns/values, like honesty and Human Rights. &amp;nbsp; All SEA members should be reconsidering what they have done with this wholesale give away and work with groups like PASCA to demonstrate what can be done in the absence of accountability mechanisms built into the PNC Park lease arrangement. &amp;nbsp; PASCA asks that the Controller&#039;s office follow up on the totality of our request.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/PDF/Sweatfree/PGH_Controller_July_3_Sweatshops_Bucco.pdf&quot;&gt;PGH_Controller_July_3_Sweatshops_Bucco.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The Black Political Empowerment Project (B-PEP) requested the assistance of Board Chairperson John Chalovich in addressing the lack of minority participation/retention in the Building Trades. &amp;nbsp; It is deplorable that the head an important City/County Board has failed to respond.&amp;nbsp; PASCA co-founder Kenneth Miller wrote an information request to the State and Federal Departments of Labor aimed at getting the information needed for a meaningful discussion of equity of minorities and fair share of the state and federal construction subsidies to our region. &amp;nbsp; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/PDF/Sweatfree/PA_dol_oct21.pdf&quot;&gt;PA_dol_oct21.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3740&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Cleaning Up After the Orioles</title>

No, it&#039;s not the Baltimore Orioles limping toward another lackluster finish at their ornate ballpark, famous for selling old-time baseball nostalgia at high-end prices. It&#039;s the scrappy members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unitedworkers.org/&quot;&gt;United Workers Association&lt;/a&gt;, fighting both the resistance of the Maryland Stadium Authority (MSA) and the apathy of Orioles owner Peter Angelos for a living wage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UWA, a human rights group founded by homeless day laborers in Baltimore, represents 800 low-wage workers who make up the pool of the 100-120 people who keep Camden Yards clean. Stadium workers--the people who clean out the bathroom stalls, sweep up the small mountains of cigarette butts and make the Camden Yards experience as pristine as promised--make poverty wages, just $7 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3616&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
