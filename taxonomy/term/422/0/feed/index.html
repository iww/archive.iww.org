 <title>Statements of Solidarity for the Strikes in Mexico</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/statements-solidarity-strikes-mexico</link>
 <description>&lt;p class=&quot;rteleft&quot;&gt;On January 25th, workers in the maquiladora plants in Matamoros, Mexico began a strike to demand a wage increase of 20% and an annual bonus of 32,000 pesos. Since then, the movement has spread to various industries: self-service shops, mining, Coca Cola factories, metal factories, and others. The workers&amp;rsquo; demands are just. We support the movement&amp;rsquo;s demands and express our sympathy and support with the movement in its struggle to improve living conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recently, there have been strong confrontations between strikers and scabs at the Coca Cola and Mecalux factories, which unfortunately resulted in 9 injuries. We stand against any type of harassment of repressive end of the conflict, and send our widest support for the situation to be resolved without violence and in favor of the striking workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/statements-solidarity-strikes-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Occupy the Workplace: Solidarity with Workers of Vio.Me (Thessaloniki, Greece)</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/occupy-workplace-solidarity-workers-viome-thessaloniki-greece</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://libcom.org/files/images/news/viome.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot; border=&quot;10&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The International Solidarity Commission (ISC) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) congratulates the workers of Viomichaniki Metaleftiki (Industrial Mining) for taking control over their factory and restarting production after having occupied it for more than 20 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
After fighting for the payment of their stolen wages since May 2011, the workers have now decided in a direct-democratic assembly to collectively organize production without bosses. They have brought the factory back into operation, shifting to the production of building materials that are not toxic or damaging for the environment. The IWW International Solidarity Commission is in full support of this move.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
As the world plunges deeper into economic and ecological crisis, the workers at Vio.Me have shown us the way forward. Instead of waiting for the state to decrease unemployment, instead of leaving their fate in the hands of the capitalist legal system or state bureaucrats, the workers of Vio.Me decided to take the factory into their own hands and to operate it themselves. The Vio.ME workers have given us all a living example of workers&amp;rsquo; power and have lit the way for all of us in the struggle against capitalism throughout the world. It is now up to all of us to take the next steps in our own workplaces and struggles. Let this be one of millions of workplace takeovers to come across Greece and the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The IWW is committed to a grassroots, global resistance to the employing class. We aim to work with others to build a movement that can defeat the capitalists and construct a new world based workers control of the means of production and a radically democratic economy. We salute the seizure of the Vio.Me factory as a step in the right direction, and pledge our solidarity and our commitment to stand at the side of all workers in the struggle for the emancipation of the working class, for the creation of a world without bosses!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW stands in solidarity with Workers of Neupack Verpackungen!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-stands-solidarity-workers-neupack-verpackungen</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Workers of Neupack Verpackungen GmbH - a German Manufacturer of wrapping materials - are on strike for better working conditions and a labor agreement. They complain about unequal and generally low wages and an arbitrary and disrespectful management style. Even though they struggle for many weeks now, the company&amp;rsquo;s proprietors show hardly any willingness to make concessions. They have hired foreign strikebreakers and attack the striking workers with disciplinary warnings, dismissals and offence reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German IWW supports the workers&amp;rsquo; cause and asks you to show them some international support as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have launched an e-mail campaign and prepared some pre-formulated and addressed e-mails to selected recipient&amp;rsquo;s who have a significant role in this struggle. These e-mails&amp;nbsp; are provided in English too and can be generated with a mouse click. All you had to do is to sign and send them off. You can of course change the content of the mails to personalize them if you like. It would be great if you added information from where you are writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German Wobblies rely on many of you to participate for they are still small in numbers and their only strength is in their internationality. For many long weeks now, the Neupack Workers hold out in front of their factories in a grueling labor conflict. This campaign would only cost you a couple of minutes in front of your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to english section of the campaign site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iww-hamburg.org/#english&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.iww-hamburg.org/#english&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your solidarity!&lt;br /&gt;
Hamburg Wobblies&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW International Solidarity Commission in solidarity with the CGT-Barcelona and Laura GÃ³mez</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-international-solidarity-commission-solidarity-cgt-barcelona-and-laura-g%C3%B3mez</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWPatch1.png&quot; /&gt;The International Solidarity Commission of the Industrial Workers of the World condemns the actions taken by the Mossos d&#039;Esquadra, Catalonia police. Laura G&amp;oacute;mez, the General Secretary of CGT-Barcelona was arrested by the Mossos d&#039;Esquadra for trumped up charges that have no basis in fact. It is obvious that this is nothing more than an act of repression and intimidation in response to the growing workers&#039; mobilizations in Spain. We demand the immediate release of Laura G&amp;oacute;mez and the withdrawal of all charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in solidarity with, and commend, the CGT-Barcelona, Laura G&amp;oacute;mez, and the rest of Spain&#039;s working class for their ongoing struggle against police repression and labour injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity Forever, &lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Solidarity to the striking workers at the Elliniki Halivourgia steel mill near Athens, Greece from the IWW&#039;s International Solidarity Commission </title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/solidarity-striking-workers-elliniki-halivourgia-steel-mill-near-athens-greece-iwws-internat</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;By the IWW&#039;s International Solidarity Commission - March 8, 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Solidarity Commission (ISC) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) sends a message of solidarity to the striking workers at the Elliniki Halivourgia steel mill near Athens, Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a record increase in profits, the company announced its plans to cut the workers&#039; pay by 40%. After a General Assembly of the workers unanimously rejected these cuts, management retaliated by firing 34 workers. Unintimidated, the workers went on strike, occupying their factory and demanding the re-hiring of their co-workers and the cancellation of the pay cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece has become the centre of the global struggle against the capitalist crisis, and the flames of your struggle inspire other workers the world over. Rather then acquiesce to the official lie of a nation united in necessary sacrifice for the common good, you have exposed the truth that the working class are not the cause of the crisis and will not pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISC applauds the brave actions of these steelworkers and urges other workers in similar circumstances to look to the example being set at Elliniki Halivourgia.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW supports Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in support of Palestinian Rights</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5282</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/photos/color/events/HPIM1778.JPG&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - December 2, 2010&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;12/2/2010 The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies) has officially voted to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement in support of Palestinian rights.  The âResolution in Support of the Workers of Palestine/Israelâ was adopted in an overwhelming vote both at the IWWâs convention in Minneapolis and by the membership via referendum.  This vote makes the IWW the first union in the US and the third union in Canada to officially support the Palestinian United Call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, the BDS movement calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel until such time as fundamental Palestinian rights are recognized.  The BDS call is supported by a broad cross-section of Palestinian society, including Palestinian unions.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The resolution to support the BDS campaign comes out of the work of the IWWâs International Solidarity Commission and the IWW Friends of Palestinian Workers Group, a grassroots network of Wobblies supportive of the Palestinian, Israeli and international struggle against Israeli apartheid.  Support for the BDS campaign was also stressed by all the Palestinian workers who met with members of the IWW on the IWW delegation to Palestine, particularly the Independent Workers Federation of Palestine, with whom the IWW shares a close bond of solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5282&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>First Hand Report from France from a Striker</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5245</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/syndicalism/cnt_march460.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=229 height=133 /&gt;I&#039;m exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve spent the last three days going from road block to road block, together with teachers, railroad workers, truckers, nurses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, in our sector, we&#039;ve managed the feat of keeping the Arnages oil depot totally closed since Friday 4 AM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, all the petrol stations in aradius of 70 kms are closed, completely out of gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept 4 hours on Friday night, 6 hours on Saturday, 2 on Monday ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we got the main Teachers&#039; Union to call on all striking teachers to come and help block all the remaining fuel depots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police can&#039;t intervene, because the truckers have established road blocks on the major roads leading to the oil depot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is incredible is that despite the fact that there is no more oil available, and therefore that people are blocked at home, a resounding 71% of the population approves of the strike (according to today&#039;s opinion polls).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movement is set to last at least another week. I spent the whole of Sunday night with transport (railway and truckers) workers playing cards and drinking beer. It was quite cold (2?C) around 4 AM, but the railroad workers brought several truck-loads of &quot;palettes&quot; (empty wooden containers) and we lit a might bonfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking workers from the neighbouring  Renault factory brought firecrackers and we spent the wee hours of the morning lighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers are determined to fight until the bitter end. Workers who chose not to go on strike are being encouraged to donate part of their salary to the workers of the most &quot;strategic&quot; sectors, especialy the Donges raffinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>German IWW pickets against austerity measures outside the Frankfurter Stadtwerke [Municipal Services]:</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5200</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Translated by a member of the British Isles IWW Regional Organizing Committee (BIROC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the IWW distributed the following flyer (image not included) in front of the Frankfurter Stadtwerke [Municipal Services]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Training outside working hours - &quot;but can they do that?&quot;
They keep getting more impertinent!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/classic/union4allclassicsm.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Today, on Saturday, colleges at EUREST have to work, because by now so many people have been made redundant that trainings can no longer take place during regular working hours. The Compass Group has right during the crises made fat profits - on the backs of their workers. Reduced staff, reduced shifts and unpaid overtime, that&#039;s their trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&#039;s not a surprise that trainings are now happening during the weekend. The location of the Stadtwerke is not the first one where this is practiced. But, no manager has put pressure on the workers quite so shamelessly. He doesn&#039;t care, that you have kids you need to care for. He doesn&#039;t even care if you&#039;re on holiday. You need to show up or proof that you already booked some trip. But time off is time off, and to force colleagues who have taken time off to go to work is, simply put, illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person like Tobias Engel does not seem to know, that the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany also apply to Eurest. Therefore, it&#039;s not surprising that the IWW Union  learnt that he recently opened the locker of a worker. How long do you want to take such infringements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&#039;t resist, you&#039;ll soon need to show up every Saturday, for a training, or to clean. And the worst is, that it seems the shop steward agreed to this. Why do the NGG-shop stewards do whatever Eurest wants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, are not just the cuddly unions and shop stewards, who don&#039;t represent the interest of the workers. As a union we can insist on the compliance with legal protections and rights of employees. But their implementation depends on whether the workers in the company resist the dismantling of workers&#039; rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ready, we&#039;ll support you in a big way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5200&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
