 <title>IWW International Solidarity Committee on union label and &quot;sweatfree certification&quot;</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4780</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/globes/IWWunivlabel1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;
The following Motion was passed unanimously by the members of the International Solidarity Committee of the Industrial Workers of the World on July 25, 2009.
&lt;br /&gt;
---
Portions of this Motion are addressed to the SweatFree Communities and the AFL-CIO Union Label Committee.  Both are convening in September.
&lt;br /&gt;
---
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/photos/color/groups/allegheny%20county%20council%20sweatshops.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;251&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Where as… there is a viable global apparel union organizing drive spearheaded by workers in the Export Processing Zones and Free Trade Zones producing apparel for the North American consumer market.  Policies that leverage the high expectations for workers rights in North American communities and the solidarity of workers in North America through licensing and procurement are a necessary component of this organizing drive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Be it resolved… that the ISC of the IWW commend SweatFree Communities on its annual conference to be held in Detroit MI on September 11- 13, 2009 and recognizes that SFC Executive Director Bjorn Claeson has worked persistently to maintain openness and substantive dialogue within the community of North America activists supporting global apparel union organizing. 
Where as… SFC has acknowledged and supported the Pittsburgh Anti Sweatshop Community Alliance’s strategy of Community Collective Bargaining with the Home Team as the only way to leverage the anti sweatshop sentiment of communities working to hold their sports teams accountable for the working conditions in which team apparel is sewn.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Be it resolved that the ISC of the IWW continues to its support of Community Collective Bargaining with the Home Team and urges our colleagues in the North America anti sweatshop movement to reject direct negotiations with any of the major leagues.
&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Onorato Drops the Ball on PA Human Rights Initiative</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4770</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Printed in the July 11, 2009 edition of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onorato&#039;s inaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the first agreement consolidating city and county procurement functions was moved in 2004, County Council jumped to ensure that it would not undermine the city&#039;s ordinance prohibiting the procurement of apparel made in sweatshops. County Manager Jim Flynn assured council that the administration could implement an effective policy. The Onorato administration has failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proud universities like Carlow, Duquesne and Carnegie Mellon use the same standards as those codified by the county to define sweatshop working conditions and monitor their collegiate licensees. The Pittsburgh Anti Sweatshop Community Alliance has presented worker testimony to the county administration from workers sewing clothes in sweatshops for companies from which the county procures. Some of those companies are Gildan, Hanes and Rocky Brands, and, of course, these companies vigorously reject the validity of their workers&#039; testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Baltimore&#039;s Human Rights Zone - Pittsburgh Baltimore Bangladesh living wages now!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4704</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/photos/color/groups/Human Rights Zone 4.18.JPG&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
Ten people from Pittsburgh traveled to Baltimore on April 18, 2009
for a B’More Fair and a Human Rights March hosted by the United Workers
Association (UWA). The United Workers Association is the Human Rights
Organization that organized the Camden Yards cleaners, part time
workers, “temporary” workers hired through a contractor, by putting
pressure on Maryland’s Stadium Authority and Peter Angelos, owner of
the Baltimore Oriels Baseball Club. They coined the terms “SweatFree
Baseball” in reference to the sweatshop working conditions at Camden
Yards at the same time as the Pittsburgh Anti Sweatshop Community
Alliance (PASCA) coined the term in reference to its demand that the
Pittsburgh Pirates accept the testimony of sweatshop workers sewing
Pirates apparel. The UWA came to Pittsburgh for the All Star Game in
2006 and joined with PASCA to make the demand that our local baseball
teams respect the Human Rights of all workers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The UWA interviewed 150 workers at three restaurants in Baltimore’s
Inner Harbor development. The interviews demonstrated systemic
violations of workers’ rights such as poverty wages and sexual
harassment. The UWA has begun to process these worker rights violations
by using the International Declaration of Human Rights like a union
contract. By declaring the Inner Harbor a Human Rights Zone, the
restaurant bosses, the developer, the public officials who provided
subsidies to the Inner Harbor developers and the Baltimore community is
made aware that the workers know and intend to exercise their Human
Rights to remedy violations of their rights. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The enforcement of workers’ Human Rights is different from
traditional union organizing in that it emphasizes workers knowing
their rights and exercising them rather than a union contract. The
emphasis is not on achieving a union contract but on the community of
workers that educate one another and provide support to one another on
a daily basis.

 <title>Activism: Local sweatshop protesters take the fight statewide</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4313</link>
 <description>&lt;span class=&quot;ContentByLine&quot;&gt;BY &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Archive?author=oid%3A41384&quot; title=&quot;Click here for Adam Fleming archives&quot;&gt;ADAM

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU410/GhangiClemente72.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
Earlier this month, Gov. Ed Rendell endorsed an interstate effort to better 
enforce anti-sweatshop policies. Pennsylvania is the first state to pledge its 
support for a proposed anti-sweatshop consortium, made up of states, counties 
and municipalities from across the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Rendell has taken the leadership of states nationally,&amp;quot; says Kenneth Miller, 
who has long been active in local anti-sweatshop campaigns. &amp;quot;He requires the 
disclosure of factory locations. He requires wage disclosure. And he&#039;s taking 
the leadership in consolidating that information with different 
jurisdictions.&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;Should the Allegheny County chief executive help local businesses make connections with overseas companies -- even if those businesses may not meet Allegheny&#039;s health, labor or human-rights standards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a question that county Councilor Bill Robinson is raising with a new piece of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/4194&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
