&lt;p&gt;SAMPLE LETTER:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To: ________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing out of concern over the treatment of Shop Steward Nick  Driedger, who has recently been dismissed. It is my understanding that  Mr Nick Driedger advances the welfare and safety of his fellow workers  in this role. It is hard to believe that someone as honest, positive,  and hard working as Nick should be dismissed, especially in light of the  charge discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Nick Driedger has been accused of stunting, a charge of which he  has not been found guilty. According to eyewitness testimony, he was  merely honking his horn, which could only make him more visible as he  drove through an area with many police and protestors. Also, according  to eyewitnesses, he ceased after hearing shouting from the officers in  question. The eyewitness testimony in his favour is substantial, and it  is disturbing that Canada Post Corporation would find Nick Driedger  guilty in advance of the verdict of a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, ____________________ request that Nick Driedger be reinstated as a  full time mail service courier with no harm to his seniority. I also  request that any targeting of him due to his activities as a CUPW shop  steward come to an immediate end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Pushing the envelope: Postal workersâ€™ struggles with Canada Post and their union over the last year</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/pushing-envelope-postal-workers%E2%80%99-struggles-canada-post-and-their-union-over-last-year</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/u&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The opinions of the author do not necessarily match those of the IWW.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image pictured to the right did not appear in the original article, we have added it here to provide a visual perspective. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is reposted in accordance to Fair Use guidelines. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2011/09/pushing-the-envelope/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Erin Hudson - &lt;em&gt;The McGill&amp;nbsp;Daily&lt;/em&gt;, September 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 22, 2010, nine  weeks after a new, arduous mail delivery system was introduced to  Winnipeg, postal workers simply walked off the job. They had the consent  of neither Canada Post nor their union leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how  Bob Tyre, president of the union&amp;rsquo;s Winnipeg branch, tells it: &amp;ldquo;One of  our temporary workers said, &amp;lsquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t do the new method. I&amp;rsquo;m more than  happy to do work in another depot &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ll deliver the old way &amp;ndash; but this  new way is too much for me and I can&amp;rsquo;t do it.&amp;rsquo; So they suspended him on  the spot and that angered the building. We had four letter carrier  depots in that building together. When the boss wouldn&amp;rsquo;t back off, well,  then, they walked out for a day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walkout would set the stage  for six months of workers&amp;rsquo; struggles, culminating in this summer&amp;rsquo;s mail  strike. But the walkout would also inspire some workers to break with  their union&amp;rsquo;s powerful National Executive and to question the future of  unions. From November 2010 to June 2011, anarchism arrived at the post  office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Canada Post Corporation (CPC) introduced the  Modern Post &amp;ndash; a new method of delivering mail that would begin the  transformation Canada Post believes they need in order to modernize,  become financially sustainable, and maintain relevance in the digital  age where mail volume per address is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Modern Post  plans to motorize letter carriers and implement a two-bundle carrying  method. The two-bundle system will consist of one bundle of presequenced  mail to hold on the forearm, and a second bundle of flyers to be handed  out at each point of call. Instead of letter carriers sorting their  mail in the plant, machines will sequence the majority of mail, which  means that letter carriers will spend more time on delivery routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parcel  delivery drivers will be almost completely eliminated. The Canadian  Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) estimates that in Montreal, Toronto,  Hamilton, and Scarborough, 306 jobs will be cut as a result of the new  system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside a union meeting in Montreal, delivery agent Denis  Auger Delegue said this is his first bad year at the post office in 32  years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Post was first implemented in Winnipeg&amp;rsquo;s Southwest  and Northeast depots. The system came in two waves, beginning the  transition on September 20, and completing it on October 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On  November 4, following a court decision prohibiting workers from refusing  to work under Modern Post, the CUPW &amp;ndash; which represents all Canadian  postal workers &amp;ndash; released a web bulletin weighing in on the matter.  Their message: the union&amp;rsquo;s collective agreement, which was set to expire  at the end of January 2011, would not protect workers who walked off  the job to protest the Modern Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With little concrete action  taken by CUPW&amp;rsquo;s National Executive, workers facing the daily challenges  of the Modern Post took matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
