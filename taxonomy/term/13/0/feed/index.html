 <title>Never Again? Sago Just the Latest Coal Disaster</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2009</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Richard Myers - &lt;a target=&quot;_self&quot; href=&quot;/projects/IW/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industrial Worker&lt;/em&gt;, February 2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/classic/MCMW200sm.jpg&quot; /&gt;One miner is injured in an explosion and will soon die. Twelve miners walk through the mine without necessary information or direction, their lives also in mortal danger.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The communication system has failed and ventilation controls were damaged during an explosion, allowing the buildup of dangerous gases. The emergency response is deficient, it fails to protect and evacuate miners at risk. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But this was not the Sago Mine in West Virginia. This was Brookwood, in Alabama, September of 2001. There had been a methane explosion, injuring four miners. Three were carried to safety. A second, larger explosion took the lives of the miner immobilized in the first blast, and twelve would-be rescuers. It was one disaster in an endless thread of disasters, a continuing calamity across the ages. &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2009&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>The True Cost of Coal</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/1044</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Geoffrey Frost - &lt;em&gt;Industrial Worker&lt;/em&gt;, June 2005.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;Several Wobblies in Pittsburgh and in Appalachia are working to support Mountain Justice Summer. Mountain Justice Summer is a campaign to stop Mountaintop Removal (MTR) mining, an environmentally devastating mining practice. &lt;p&gt;Mountaintop removal is what it sounds like: coal companies blast off the tops of mountains to get at thin seams of coal that are hauled off to fire the power plants. MTR is how the power companies provide &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; energy to the rest of the United States. Of course, it doesn&#039;t really come cheap. Mountaintop removal is the neoliberal vision fulfilled: a handful of poorly paid, non-union workers destroying one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth to fuel power plants that spew out yet more pollution upon the usually poor working-class communities around them, all the while stoking the furnace of global warming that causes the deaths of thousands upon thousands of working people each year and is only growing worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the cheap energy that dooms our children to asthma, mercury poisoning, and perhaps no future at all. This is the &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; energy demanded by our government.s financiers to fuel their uninhibited accumulation of wealth at the expense of all else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/1044&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
