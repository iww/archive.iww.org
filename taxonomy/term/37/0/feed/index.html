 <title>Seattle IWW Local 650 Day of Action Round Up Against Grassroots Campaign</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/seattle-iww-local-650-day-action-round-against-grassroots-campaign</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Seattle IWW - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/seattle-iww-local-650-day-of-action-round-up-against-grassroots-campaign/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, August 13, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow Workers from the Seattle IWW Industrial Union local 650 (IU650) at Grassroots Campaigns (GCI) are facing an illegal office closure by the GCI bosses in retaliation for an Unfair Labor Practice Strike action protesting egregious labor violations. Just under a week after the office closed, Wobblies at the Seattle GCI job branch called for a National Day of Action on Friday, August 10th. Wobblies in other GCI offices around the country are starting to face increased heat from management&amp;rsquo;s aggressive union busting. Most are fighting back &amp;ndash; and winning. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick roundup from each of the seven actions.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW Canvassers On Strike, Nationwide Actions in Support</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-canvassers-strike-nationwide-actions-support</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Seattle IWW - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/iww-canvassers-on-strike-nationwide-actions-in-support/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, July 31, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/xGroup1.jpeg.pagespeed.ic.19IPM4Db9d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Grassroots Campaigns, Inc. (GCI) is a nationwide, for-profit canvassing contractor which fundraises for progressive nonprofits. GCI canvassers can be seen on countless street corners in large cities and college towns, talking to folks about groups like Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and Doctors Without Borders. Despite the company&amp;rsquo;s claims of a &amp;ldquo;progressive&amp;rdquo; platform, its record of worker abuse and union busting is extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years now, GCI workers have attempted to organize with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Building interest has not been too much of a challenge, since idealistic folks get recruited for &amp;ldquo;organizing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;activist&amp;rdquo; jobs, but soon find that miserable conditions lead to high turnover rates. New hires are often sympathetic to any drive to bring about change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger hurdle in the past has been how to navigate GCI&amp;rsquo;s blatant disregard for labor law and the challenges of keeping a campaign going in the face of constant attrition. Past drives in Portland and Ann Arbor laid some of the groundwork for how to organize, but ultimately fell short of their goals and provided valuable insight into the company&amp;rsquo;s strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current campaign, originating in Seattle, has thus far been the most successful. Although workers there have faced countless abuses since going public in February, they have managed to expand the public presence of their IWW IU650 campaign to New Orleans and wider, while building out a network of support and solidarity across the country. A number of small victories so far, such as a $2/hr raise in New Orleans and the resignation of several abusive corporate-installed managers in Seattle, have fueled this rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCI has not made the task of organizing easy. For a week-and-a-half in June, the company illegally locked out its Seattle office in retaliation for a union action demanding better training and onboarding for new hires. The lockout was broken through nationwide direct action and legal threats, but since reopening the company has waged an all-out war on its workers. Workers around the country have been faced with direct sabotage by the company and numerous illegal unilateral changes to working conditions. To top it all off, three workers in different cities were illegally fired in July amidst a cloud of blatant lies and deceptions from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this latest attack, GCI workers across the country were forced to fight back. On Friday, July 27, Seattle IU650 members kicked things off with a strike against the company&amp;rsquo;s unfair labor practices. In seven other cities, actions took place aimed at building the union&amp;rsquo;s shop-floor presence and forcing the company to do right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IU650 members are united in demanding the rehiring of all those impacted by the company&amp;rsquo;s illegal union busting, improvements to the company&amp;rsquo;s harsh quota system, and protections in the case of bad weather, street harassment, and other issues that might force canvassers to drop shifts. In addition, they are working to fight unique local challenges ranging from lockouts to laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dispatch from the Picket Line: IWW Fights Lockouts in Seattle</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/dispatch-picket-line-iww-fights-lockouts-seattle</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seattle IWW - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/dispatch-from-the-picket-line-iww-fights-lockouts-in-seattle/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, July 25, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/Group1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;The union drive at Grassroots Campaigns Incorporated (GCI) has been nothing short of profound. Throughout months of organizing we built an unparalleled culture of resistance and solidarity and a tangible sense that we don&amp;rsquo;t need bosses to get work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of May we realized that something was off. May and June are typically the biggest hiring periods with the office frequently swelling to 40 or 50 canvassers by  midsummer. This year, though, the interim directors sent by corporate were simply not bringing in new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to shop floor agitation and legal threats, we were able to force the company to begin hiring by the end of May, but we soon found ourselves with a new problem. New hires were being made Field Managers (FMs) on their fourth or fifth days. FMs are similar to shift leads at other jobs but with extra paperwork, no real power, and often no increase in pay. When new workers should have been learning the skills needed to canvass, they were instead being asked to supervise other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new hires felt like they were being pressured to quit by being given such responsibilities so quickly. They joined the union to do something about it. We sympathized with their issue and decided to March on the Boss on Friday, June 8 to demand that new hires get at least two weeks on the job before being asked to take on FM responsibilities. We reasonably expected the current director would accede to our demand on the spot, but, because of the company&amp;rsquo;s consistent and blatant lawbreaking practices, we wanted to have the agreement in writing, which was something the company was incredibly averse to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten of us, including all of the recent new hires, entered the director&amp;rsquo;s office shortly before our morning circle. We delivered our demand and, as expected, she agreed verbally. She stated that she would get us something in writing by the end of the day but that she needed to talk to Laurie Owen (the company&amp;rsquo;s General Counsel and chief union buster) to find out exactly what she was allowed to write. She agreed that one of our members could stay a bit late while she waited for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the office went out to canvass, and the hours ticked by. By noon it was starting to become clear that Laurie wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give us anything. The director was told to write  nothing down, although she was assured she had discretion over the policy to ensure all new hires have at least two weeks on the job before taking on FM responsibilities. At lunchtime, one union member pointed out that because we had received a promise to have something in writing by the end of the day, the day couldn&amp;rsquo;t be over until we had it. We all agreed and decided that if we didn&amp;rsquo;t have something by the time we returned from canvassing we would remain on the clock discussing workplace conditions&amp;nbsp;with our manager until she gave us what she had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the afternoon debriefs, seven people found themselves in the director&amp;rsquo;s office. For the next four and a half hours, there was continuous discussion about workplace conditions with the manager interspersed with songs and teach&amp;shy;-ins. We were told repeatedly that no one would have to leave or be forced to clock out. At 9:45pm, we finally received a written notice from the manager that she could not commit policy to writing. Having forced a response that would greatly aid in future legal matters, we left feeling elated at the power of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IU650, the 9th of the month has become something of a harbinger of major events. On March 9, we voted 15&amp;shy;-2 in an NLRB election for federal recognition of our existing union. On April 9, our contract was signed. On May 9, we held a March on the Boss regarding holiday pay that coincided with the New Orleans office filing for an NLRB election. June 9, the day after our sit-&amp;shy;in, proved equally momentous as it turned out to be the first day of our lockout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been preparing for a lockout for the better part of a month. While its immediate arrival was somewhat of a&amp;nbsp;surprise, we were more than prepared to meet it head on. The very first day we received calls from corporate stating that the Seattle office was suspended, but we showed we were more than capable of working even without an open  office. This act struck existential fear into management, who now knew we could do our jobs without them. We also had a solid legal case against them, thanks to their admission that the lockout was retaliation for the June 8 action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical companies might obscure retaliatory actions behind a thin smoke screen. GCI, though, has been so blatant and consistent with its lawbreaking that even the NLRB can&amp;rsquo;t help but find sympathy with our arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued rolling out a campaign of direct action and workplace self-&amp;shy;organization. On June 14th, we launched a phone zap against the corporate office with the aim of getting hundreds, if not thousands, to call GCI&amp;rsquo;s headquarters and demand they end the lockout. Coinciding with this, we began running our own autonomous canvass in the streets of Seattle designed to build support for the union and get people to join in on the phone zap. This powerful collective action gave us a profound sense of what it means to work for ourselves on our own terms and in control of our own labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picketing started that same day. On Thursday and Friday we held spirited informational pickets outside our locked office in Fremont. We drew attention around the neighborhood and the community. Our numbers swelled from 30 attendees the first day to over 50 on the second. Simultaneously, we received solidarity from around the country with pickets at GCI offices in Denver, Raleigh-Durham, Philadelphia, and at the HQ in Boston. Taking to the streets was both a means of catharsis and community building and, when placed in a national context, had the potential to put serious pressure on GCI&amp;rsquo;s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued to organize over the next few days. We fleshed out our plans for a direct action escalation campaign. Fortunately, those plans became unnecessary on  Wednesday, June 20, when almost everyone in the office received a new set of phone calls from corporate: the office would reopen on Thursday. The lockout was over. We had  won.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Burgerville Workers Fight and Win Co-Worker’s Job Back</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/burgerville-workers-fight-and-win-co-worker%E2%80%99s-job-back</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Burgerville Workers Union - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-fight-and-win-job-back/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, July 12, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/1-4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Report from the Burgerville Workers Union of the IWW who recently fought and won the rehiring of a co-worker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet Brookelynn, a longtime Burgerville worker at the Gladstone store  and a strong union supporter. She worked at Burgerville for two years  before leaving the job in December for family reasons. Brookelynn  reapplied shortly afterwards, much to everyone&amp;rsquo;s excitement, and it&amp;rsquo;s  even Burgerville policy to rehire workers who reapply within three  months of quitting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of how strong a union supporter she is, however, Burgerville  refused to rehire her, violating their own policy. The General Manager,  Michael Dawson, hired at least ten other people while Brookelynn kept  reapplying, discriminating against her over and over again for her union  membership. Meanwhile, Burgerville has spent thousands and thousands of  dollars on ads claiming to value their employees and that they do not  intimidate or retaliate against workers for being part of the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of fighting, Brookelynn and the union finally won her  job back! She returned to work today and everyone is thrilled.  Furthermore, the National Labor Relations Board found merit in  Brookelynn&amp;rsquo;s charges of anti-union discrimination, which means  Burgerville will likely face legal consequences for their union busting  activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited about the ongoing contract negotiations, but this just  goes to show how important it is to keep fighting outside the bargaining  room as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, Brookelynn! When we fight, we win!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Fundraiser to Support Members of IU650</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/fundraiser-support-members-iu650</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/Group1.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve received an incredible outpouring of solidarity during and since the end of out lockout. While we may be able to win back the lost two weeks of wages through court battles down the line, many of our workers may have trouble making rent and paying other vital bills this month with the short paychecks. Any support you can give will go a long way towards helping those folks out and making sure we can stand strong as we continue our campaign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/help-illegally-locked-out-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click here to donate to IU650&amp;rsquo;s hardship fund&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which will directly benefit our fellow workers who experience financial hardship as a result of GCI&amp;rsquo;s illegal and immoral lockout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Statement from IU650&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not the first canvassing shop to threaten to Unionize. We aren&amp;rsquo;t even the first canvassing shop to follow up on that threat with an NLRB election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a canvassing shop when you go down that path you always hear the same threat. The Bosses will close down your shop. Thats illegal, so they whisper it, they tell it through innuendo, they imply it with stories about other offices that tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 11th IU 650 Seattle was informed that operations were suspended at the office. We were locked out in response to legally protected concerted action and they were, you know, basically closing the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched into action. We took legal recourse. We reached out to our friends and supporters asking them to help with our call in campaign. We reminded Grassroots Campaigns that we work in the street. You can&amp;rsquo;t lock us out of the street. We organize for a living, they cannot expect us not to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picketed. Wobblies in multiple cities, from Seattle to Boston took direct action on picket lines. Our IU 650 friends in the Deep South stood up for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people called. Eventually they heard us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle office of Grassroots Campaigns reopened its doors on June 21st and the members of IU 650 have returned to work. The terms are still under negotiation, many workers have been forced to change campaigns and it has of course provided cover for yet another round of unilateral changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that office is open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a canvasser. If you organize folks for a living and your boss tells you that you will be punished for organizing with your coworkers. If they subtly imply that canvassing shops get closed down for organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle says they can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for all of your help.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>DC IWW Supports the TPSS Co-Op Workers Union for $15/hour and a Union</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/dc-iww-supports-tpss-co-op-workers-union-15hour-and-union</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Cal - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dciww.org/2017/07/26/dc-iww-supports-the-tpss-co-op-workers-union-for-15hour-and-a-union/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DC IWW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, July 30, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/tpssphoto-624x832.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The DC General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) supports the TPSS Co-op workers in their struggle to unionize. Wages lag behind the rising cost of living in the DC metropolitan area. In Takoma Park, the average cost of living is much higher than in other parts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tpmobilization.org/the-fight-for-15&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, and even a starting salary of $11.50 is unacceptable. A starting wage of $15/hour&amp;ndash;though not ideal&amp;ndash;is a reasonable demand that allows workers the chance to afford rent, transportation, child care and sustenance in one of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We further support the rights of all workers to unionize, ensuring fair and equitable treatment during these trying times. Moreover, a union will foster a spirit of unity and cooperation among workers so TPSS Co-op can continue to be a place of respect, dignity, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPSS Co-op is a member-owned cooperative, and the IWW shares many of the the values and goals of the Co-op: a healthy planet, democratic/cooperative ownership, and community-sourced goods and resources. A fully democratically organized workplace is necessary to help strengthen the bonds between the co-op, its workers, its members, and the community at-large. &amp;nbsp;The financial statements, publically available on the TPSS Co-op website, &amp;nbsp;indicate good financial health through growth, profitability, and the ability to consistently meet its obligations. To remain successful, the co-op must also fulfill its obligations of utmost importance &amp;ndash; paying a reasonable wage to its workers and providing improved working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage the membership, the Board of Representatives, and the greater Takoma Park community to support the workers of the TPSS co-op in creating a truly democratic community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe such a community is in the best interest of everyone and that a productive conversation, centering the workers&amp;rsquo; needs, will build a stronger relationship&amp;ndash;grounded in solidarity&amp;ndash;between the TPSS workers and the Takoma Park Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We the membership of the DC General Membership Branch of the IWW hereby fully endorse the efforts of the TPSS Co-op workers&amp;rsquo; union and pledge our support, solidarity and aid to our fellow workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC General Membership Branch &amp;ndash; Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff members of the Green Party of the United States announce the formation of a union (they get the IWW&#039;s name wrong; it&#039;s in fact &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Industrial&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;--not &amp;quot;International&amp;quot; Workers of the World, but it&#039;s the thought that counts).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Victory as People Power Forces Liverpool Council Homeless Fines U-Turn</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/victory-people-power-forces-liverpool-council-homeless-fines-u-turn</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Admin - &lt;a href=&quot;https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/victory-as-people-power-forces-liverpool-council-homeless-fines-u-turn/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liverpool IWW&lt;/a&gt;, November 5, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://liverpooliww.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/homelessness.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Liverpool Industrial Workers of the World unreservedly welcomes the sensational decision of Liverpool City Council to scrap their consultation on plans to fine the homeless a whole eight days ahead of its planned conclusion. We are delighted that homeless people now no longer face this added threat of being penalised for the social crime of homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Oxford, Hackney and Wycombe authority before them, Mayor Joe Anderson&amp;rsquo;s council has floated the idea, hoping it will go through, only to be overwhelmed by the public backlash against it. In doing so, the council has shown the potential of mass working class action to make changes in the world. Anderson and Liverpool Labour have given way on this one issue, because it risked jeopardising the rest of their austerity agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only yesterday morning, Liverpool IWW started a Facebook event page proposing a demonstration against the homeless fines. Within hours, scores had pledged they would attend, hundreds of people had been invited, and many were leaving comments on the page. Some raised their own demands, such as Joe Anderson paying back the &amp;pound;89,000 of public money he received from the council for legal advice on a private matter (he&amp;rsquo;d been sacked by a school he did no work for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homeless fines threatened to be a &amp;lsquo;straw that broke the camel&amp;rsquo;s back&amp;rsquo;. When asked by the media for a reaction in response to Liverpool IWW&amp;rsquo;s press release, the council retreated a step. The council&amp;rsquo;s deployment of pro-cuts Councillor Rachael O&amp;rsquo;Byrne to the Facebook event page confirms this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liverpool Labour&amp;rsquo;s explanation for the whole affair beggars belief. According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/news-and-comment/plans-to-fine-liverpool-beggars-1000-scrapped&quot;&gt;Liverpool Confidential&lt;/a&gt; , &amp;ldquo;Anderson intervened to have the scheme scrapped after hearing about the proposals yesterday [Wednesday]&amp;rdquo;. Councillor Steve Munby went on, &amp;ldquo;The proposal was not a decision by the council cabinet, but was drawn up by officers following complaints from residents and the BID [Business Improvement District].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are charitable to Anderson, it still looks devastatingly bad. He is the mayor of the city, he is paid a large salary, and he dines with the greedy business owners who were pushing this scheme on a very regular basis. If the official story is to be believed, he was somehow unaware of the council consultation nearly a month after it began on 9th October. He is therefore totally out of touch with the affairs of his own council, and totally incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The far more likely explanation, of course, is that Anderson, O&amp;rsquo;Byrne, Munby and colleagues are simply lying through their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liverpool IWW will continue to fight for the interests of all working class people in the local area, so we can guarantee that this is not the last that Mayor Anderson and all his bloodsoaked poverty pimps will hear of us.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Liverpool IWW Spread Message that Claimant Advocacy is Not a Crime!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/liverpool-iww-spread-message-claimant-advocacy-not-crime</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Admin - &lt;a href=&quot;https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/liverpool-iww-spread-message-that-claimant-advocacy-is-not-a-crime/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liverpool IWW&lt;/a&gt;, October 12, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/scousewobs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This afternoon, members and supporters of Liverpool IWW held an  information picket outside the town centre job centre, on Williamson  Square. We are one of several IWW groups and other activist  organisations holding demonstrations at job centres this week. Scottish  Unemployed Workers Network called for solidarity with claimant advocate  Tony Cox, who faces court in Forfar tomorrow on the ludicrous charges of  threatening behaviour, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/901080539929227/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;refusing to give his name and address and resisting arrest&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested at an Arbroath job centre last January, whilst representing a highly vulnerable unemployed woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scottish Unemployed Workers Network assert that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We believe that this case highlights the climate of fear that is  evident within many job centres, but that it is not only benefit  claimants that are treated with contempt. Welfare advisors are also  being subjected to bullying and intimidation, as in the recent case of  Mike Vallance at High Riggs Job Centre, when they attempt to represent,  often highly vulnerable, benefit claimants. The SUWN will resist any and  all attempts to curb the rights of welfare and citizen advocates to  represent the unemployed, and we ask you to join us in our fight to  ensure that ADVOCACY IS NOT A CRIME.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Liverpool today, we distributed info provided by&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edinburghagainstpoverty.org.uk/node/32&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty&lt;/a&gt;,  backing up with legal statements the fact that &amp;lsquo;advocacy is not a  crime&amp;rsquo;. Claimants visiting the job centre took our advice  enthusiastically, and were generally pleased that someone was taking a  stand against the Department for Work and Pensions, and the bullying  regime inside job centres. Our social networking presence also got a  number of likes and follows during the picket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the response was so positive that we will soon begin a  regular series of job centre info distribution pickets, offering advice,  encouragement and solidarity to claimants &amp;ndash; who represent some of the  most vulnerable elements of the working class.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Twin Cities IWW wins unpaid wages from local daycare</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/twin-cities-iww-wins-unpaid-wages-local-daycare</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Admin - &lt;a href=&quot;http://tcorganizer.com/2015/10/10/twin-cities-iww-wins-unpaid-wages-from-local-daycare/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twin Cities IWW&lt;/a&gt;, October 10, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/TwinCitiesDayCare1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This summer, IWW member Anja was fired from her job at Crocus Hill  Academy, a daycare. She was told that it was for talking to current and  former coworkers about issues with their boss, Imran Khan. Two weeks  later, Anja had yet to receive her final paycheck, her personal  belongings, or a copy of her personnel file, which she had requested.  Three union members from the Twin Cities IWW branch accompanied Anja to  the daycare to deliver a demands letter. Mr. Khan reacted aggressively,  shouting at and threatening the union delegation, accusing Anja of  mistreating children, and calling St. Paul Police. He refused to accept  the letter, and police asked IWW members to vacate the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, a larger group of IWW members leafleted the  daycare. As Mr. Khan yelled from the door, union members talked to  parents about Anja&amp;rsquo;s firing and other grievances. Upon Mr. Khan&amp;rsquo;s  continued refusal to receive the letter, branch members conducted a  call-in and social media campaign against Crocus Hill Academy. Within a  few days, Anja received a call from the school&amp;rsquo;s new director, begging  her to give him a copy of the demands which Mr. Khan refused to accept.  She has since received her final paycheck and an additional check for  $120 to compensate for her personal belongings and personnel file, both  of which Mr. Khan &amp;ldquo;misplaced.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulative, lying bosses like Mr. Khan are a danger to all working  people, especially when they punish workers for protected activity like  talking about work conditions and steal wages. But when we stand alone,  or when we look to the government for help, we give up our power to  fight. When we come together with other working people, we can get what  we deserve. Direct action works and solidarity wins. Get in touch with  the Twin Cities IWW if you have problems at work.&lt;/p&gt;
