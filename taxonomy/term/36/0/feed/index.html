 <title>Burgerville Workers Union Wins Second Victory</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/burgerville-workers-union-wins-second-victory</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Burgerville Workers Union - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-wins-second-victory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, May 14, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/BVWU2018S_0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The following statement was released  yesterday from the Burgerville Workers Union, after another store  successfully won union recognition. The BVWU is the first officially  recognized fast food union in the United States and is a part of the  Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Burgerville workers once again voted overwhelmingly in favor of  the BVWU, this time at the Gladstone location. This is the second NLRB  election the BVWU has won in a month. The first, at 92nd and Powell,  made us the only fast food union in the country, and this one  demonstrates the momentum the BVWU has going into contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gladstone workers in particular deserve extra celebration for their win today. Despite the friendly attitude Burgervi&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;lle  has taken in the press about being willing to work with the union,  Gladstone workers didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything close to friendliness on the shop  floor. During the election, despite all their words of openness and  cooperation, Burgerville was up to its old tricks: retaliation,  intimidation, even straight up lying. Gladstone workers faced down all  of that and STILL won a major victory for the union. Standing up to your  boss like that takes bravery and every one of them deserves applause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win at 92nd wasn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the fight, and neither is this win  at Gladstone. The fight won&amp;rsquo;t be over until Burgerville stops paying us  poverty wages, stops threatening undocumented immigrants through their  use of e-verify, and stops treating us like we&amp;rsquo;re disposable. We demand  respect, and we won&amp;rsquo;t stop until we get it. Gladstone is an important  step in that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember too that the boycott is on until the company signs a fair contract. They&amp;rsquo;re not off the hook yet.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Burgerville Workers Union Becomes First Formally Recognized Fast Food Union in the US</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/burgerville-workers-union-becomes-first-formally-recognized-fast-food-union-us</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Burgerville Workers Union - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-becomes-first-formally-recognized-fast-food-union-in-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, April 24, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/Burgerville.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Burgerville Workers Union has won a  union election in one location, meaning that the company will be forced  to negotiate a contract with the workers. Other stores are expected to  soon come on board. BVWU, a part of the IWW, also becomes the first fast  food chain in the US to be unionized. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won the election. We did it. We made history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today workers at 92nd and Powell overwhelmingly voted yes, making the  Burgerville Workers Union the only formally recognized fast food union  in the country. For a long time people have dismissed fast food as  unorganizable, saying that turnover is too high, or the workers are too  spread out. Today Burgerville workers proved them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight isn&amp;rsquo;t over, of course. We still need to bargain a fair contract with Burgerville, an&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;d  until then the boycott still stands. And we need to remember what got  us to this point: workers taking action for themselves, standing up  against poverty wages and horrible conditions. We got here because of  the strike, union benefits, pickets, and marches on the boss. We got  here through direct action, and that won&amp;rsquo;t change now that we&amp;rsquo;ve won an  election. If anything it&amp;rsquo;s even more important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this moment of victory we want to celebrate, yes, but we also want  to turn our attention to the 4.5 million other fast food workers in the  United States. We want to speak to everyone else who works for poverty  wages, who are constantly disrespected on the job, who are told they  aren&amp;rsquo;t educated enough, aren&amp;rsquo;t experienced enough, aren&amp;rsquo;t good enough  for a decent life. To all of those workers, to everyone like us who  works rough jobs for terrible pay, we say this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to that bullshit. Burgerville workers didn&amp;rsquo;t, and look at us now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our win today isn&amp;rsquo;t just about Burgerville. It&amp;rsquo;s about  history. It&amp;rsquo;s about a movement of workers who know that a better world  is possible, and that together they can make that world real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we became the only recognized fast food union in the country. But we won&amp;rsquo;t be the only one for long.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Portland, OR: Burgerville Singles Out One Worker for Retaliation Following Strike</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/portland-or-burgerville-singles-out-one-worker-retaliation-following-strike</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Burgerville Workers Union - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/portland-burgerville-singles-one-worker-retaliation-following-strike/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, February 16, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/5-13-1068x648.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The following report from the  Burgerville Workers Union states that management has come down against  one pro-union worker of color since the end of the historic three day  strike. To learn more about the strike, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/audio-report-burgerville-workers-union-finish-three-day-strike/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;check out our audio report podcast here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burgerville chose to celebrate Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day yesterday by  retaliating against a union leader. Michelle, a worker at the Convention  Center Burgerville who participated in our historic three day long  strike, was just suspended by management for allegedly taking a chicken  patty without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though retaliation against union members under trumped up &amp;ldquo;theft&amp;rdquo;  accusations is a pattern at Burgerville, Michelle&amp;rsquo;s suspension  demonstrates a particularly disturbing unders&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;ide  to that pattern. Along with Arsenio and Canaan, Michelle is the third  pro-union worker of color to be fired by Convention Center management in  as many weeks, a management which remains entirely white despite the  diversity of the crew. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;In the targeting of union members of  color at the Convention Center, to put it bluntly, we see not only union  busting but outright racism. These attacks on our jobs and our families  by Burgerville corporate are not just against Burgerville workers, but  rather against the rights and power of the Portland community as a  whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BVWU does not take this lightly. In addition to Arsenio, Canaan,  and Michelle, two other pro-union workers at stores that went on strike  have been fired or suspended for similar charges within the last few  months. Though Burgerville claims to be an ethical, locally minded fast  food company, their wages keep workers in poverty, and when those  workers try to better their lives, they are threatened with firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Michelle&amp;rsquo;s suspension, we see Burgerville perpetuating an  atmosphere of fear and racism in order to fight the union, and we are  currently in talks with our allies around Portland as well as our legal  counsel as to how to best proceed. Please stay tuned &amp;ndash; moments like  these, when people&amp;rsquo;s jobs are on the line, are when we need our  supporters the most.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Audio Report: Burgerville Workers Union Finish Three Day Strike</title>

&lt;p&gt;In this audio report, we talked to someone with the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BVWkrUnion&quot;&gt;Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU)&lt;/a&gt;, which is a part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a revolutionary anti-capitalist union founded in 1905. The Burgerville campaign went public in 2016, and in the past several years, has launched a series of strikes, job actions, pickets, and various campaigns in the face of an ongoing anti-union crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this repression, members of BVWU have built relationships with various local groups and unions, who have in turn brought people to walk pickets lines and often serve free hamburgers outside of Burgerville stores during various job actions. To learn more about this back story, check out our previous podcast interviews with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-take-job-organize/&quot;&gt;BVWU members here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-service-workers-revolt/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this interview, we specifically talk about the recent three day strike launched by BVWU, which grew to include four stores in total who were involved in the strike. Over the course of three days, IWW members picketed stores, encouraged customers not to pay patronage to the business across the city, held rallies which were joined in solidarity with other unions, and also announced the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.boycottburgerville.com/&quot;&gt;Boycott Burgerville&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While certainly not the first or only large scale fast-food worker strike, the Burgerville campaign is historic, and represents the growing capacity of rank-n-file workers to self-organize and take action where they are to fight back against their bosses and conditions in a rapidly gentrifying city.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, Burgerville Workers  Union members also announced a public boycott of the store as pickets  continued over the weekend. On Sunday, the union announced that it was  ending its three day strike and that on Monday, workers would be  returning to work, however the struggle would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Burgerville Strike Spreads Into Second Store, Pickets Continue</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yesterday, fast food workers and members of the Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU), a part of the revolutionary anti-capitalist union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), launched a strike at the Burgerville USA chain in Portland, Oregon. Today, they announced that the strike had spread to yet another store. Below are updates from the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/burgervilleworkersunion/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burgerville Workers Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; social media accounts.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/burgervilleworkersunion/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 2nd the union announced&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;td_quote_box td_box_center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;ANOTHER STRIKE! Today at 11:15 a.m. union workers at the 25th and Powell store delegated management and walked off the job on strike. Union members and supporters are out picketing the store now and have been providing pizza to Cleveland High School students and staff who&amp;rsquo;ve joined them on the picket lines! This is the second store to walk out in as many days, and wiith Convention Center workers on day two of their strike, this is now the largest strike in BVWU history! Convention Center workers: we got your back! Special thanks for the purple solidarity we received from SEIU 49!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The Burgerville Workers Union has been hard at work for months now to empower workers and organize a strike. Yesterday, we got to see all those hours of hard work and planning come to fruition after the walkout and strike performed at the Convention Center location. Now is the time for Burgerville Corporate to hear what we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to communicate for years. As workers, we deserve better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 <title>Fast Food Workers in Portland Launch Strike at Burgerville</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/fast-food-workers-portland-launch-strike-burgerville</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Burgerville Workers Union - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/fast-food-workers-portland-launch-strike-burgerville/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, February 1, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/RAFfightracism-1-1068x625_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;In Portland, Oregon, fast food workers with Burgerville USA have walked off the job and launched a strike. In recent months, more Burgerville workers in a variety of stores have joined the union, the revolutionary anti-capitalist Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). What follows is a direct report and announcement on the strike from the Burgerville Workers Union. Follow their social media accounts on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BVWkrUnion&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/burgervilleworkersunion&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for up to the minute updates, and be sure to check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/?s=Burgerville+Workers+Union&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;our past coverage of their struggle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; as well as &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-service-workers-revolt/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;their appearances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-take-job-organize/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;our podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers at the Convention Center Burgerville just walked off the job, launching a strike and kickstarting the biggest weekend of action yet from the Burgerville Workers Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April will mark the BVWU&amp;rsquo;s second anniversary of going public. Since 2016, our demands have largely remained the same: fair wages, consistent scheduling, and affordable health care. We as a union have grown since then. We have found new ways to support each other, and&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;we have won victories in the workplace that make the weight of our day to day lives easier to bear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, however, Burgerville still refuses to negotiate with the union. The company continues to ignore the voices of its workers, prioritizing profits over the human needs of the workers who make those profits possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on strike today because no one deserves to live in poverty. Life in Portland only gets harder &amp;ndash; rents go up, groceries get more expensive, and Burgerville wages stay unlivable.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Portland, OR: Burgerville Workers Union Pickets and Expands Into More Stores</title>

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, January 24th, the Burgerville Workers Union (BWU) held its first picket of 2018 outside of a Burgerville store in Portland. BWU is a part of the revolutionary anti-capitalist union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and in the past year has grown to include workers in a variety of stores across the chain. Burgerville, which brands itself as a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo; large fast food corporation, has refused to negotiate with BWU, and has even hired anti-union goons in an attempt to stop the IWW, as well as firing various organizers over trivial incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New York: Wobblies at Singing Restaurant Win Major Victory</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/new-york-wobblies-singing-restaurant-win-major-victory</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Stardust Family United - October 4, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/Stardust1_0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;In a major victory for the singing servers at Ellen&amp;rsquo;s Stardust Diner, their employer has reached an agreement with their solidarity union, Stardust Family United, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). By entering into the settlement agreement, the company will narrowly avoid a trial on some 19 violations of the National Labor Relations Act, including 31 retaliatory firings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, all 31 employees termina&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;ted over the last year in retaliation for union activity have been offered immediate and full reinstatement, and will receive back pay from the time they were fired. Of the terminated employees, 13 will immediately return to work at the popular Midtown diner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the restaurant is required to mail official notices to all employees, informing them that the company will not violate federal law by engaging in certain unlawful practices such as surveilling and threatening workers, interfering with their use of social media, and discouraging them from taking action to improve working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the singing servers, this has been a long road. The union, which is a branch of the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), initially went public in late summer of 2016. Weeks after making their efforts known to management, 16 active union members were fired. Over the fall and winter, the workers continued to engage in direct workplace action to improve health and safety conditions, as well as pursue other demands. Another mass firing in January 2017 brought the total of terminated singers up to 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Stardust Family United remained active, both inside and outside the restaurant. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled and proud to know our struggle and vigilance over the last year has paid off,&amp;rdquo; says returning employee Matthew Patterson. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to returning and making a positive impact inside the diner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Portland, OR: Fast Food Workers at Burgerville Launch Strike on Labor Day</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/portland-or-fast-food-workers-burgerville-launch-strike-labor-day</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Staff - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/portland-fast-food-workers-burgerville-launch-strike-labor-day/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, September 4, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/3-4-1068x599.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;179&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) launched a strike in Portland, Oregon at fast food chain Burgerville. The strike is the latest move by workers at the chain who have been organizing for months and demanding wage increases, an end to harassment for union activities, better schedules, and improvements of conditions. The group announced the strike on Labor Day with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/burgervilleworkersunion/?ref=br_rs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement on their Facebook page:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;td_quote_box td_box_center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The very first Labor Day was a massive strike and parade organized by thousands of workers in New York City in 1882. The chance for millions and millions of people to spend time with family and community this Monday was made possible by power wielded time and time again by striking workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Ironically, we workers at Burgerville don&amp;rsquo;t get to enjoy this day dedicated to celebrating the power of workers. Working at Burgerville means we can&amp;rsquo;t ta&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;ke proper holidays, since doing so means taking a substantial pay cut or facing retaliation from management. Working at Burgerville means that we spend our holidays working for minimum wage just like any other day, fully aware of all the memories with friends and family we are missing out on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why we are going on strike today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Instead of going to work for poverty wages while corporate bigshots take vacations, we are taking a stand. We are taking back Labor Day for our families, our friends, our coworkers, and ourselves. We are taking back Labor Day because we know that better pay, fair schedules, consistent hours, and healthier work environments have only ever been won by workers standing together and fighting for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;We are the heart of Burgerville and we deserve a change!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strike also takes place as fast food workers at McDonald&amp;rsquo;s in the UK are also on strike. Burgerville workers union writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;td_quote_box td_box_center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;McDonald&amp;rsquo;s workers at two shops in England voted to go on a strike on September 4. These workers are organized through the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU), whose demands include wage increases and more consistent scheduling (Sound familiar?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Immediately after the announcement of a strike, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s stated that by the end of 2017 they will implement a guaranteed hours contract to every McDonald&amp;rsquo;s worker in the UK. The BFAWU&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;plans to carry on with their strike to push for their other demands and to hold McDonald&amp;rsquo;s to their word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victory to the strikers!&lt;/p&gt;
