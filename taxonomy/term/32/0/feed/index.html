 <title>AT&amp;T Workers, You Are Not Alone! Strike Flyer Handout</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/att-workers-you-are-not-alone-strike-flyer-handout</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1zzz-12.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width: 95%;&quot; src=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1zzz-12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;1zzz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this then over 40,000 CWA union members have walked off their jobs as part of a three day strike against AT&amp;amp;T. The strike at the telecommunications giant is just one of the latest in a string of strikes by workers in the industry that have all pushed back against attacks on wages, health care, job outsourcing, and corporate globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite tough talk from both major capitalist parties and Trump in particular, since the economic meltdown of 2008, the only thing that has changed is that billions of dollars have moved out of the hands of poor and working-class people and into the hands of the billionaires &amp;ndash; who are now running the government.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Boston IWW Joins Striking Verizon Workers on the Picket Line</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/boston-iww-joins-striking-verizon-workers-picket-line</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Members of the Boston IWW joined striking Verizon workers for their second day of pickets at the regional headquarters in downtown Boston.   Striking members of IBEW local 2222 were pleased with the show of solidarity as we marched together in the sometimes driving rain. The strikers were in good spirits as they walked the all-day picket line and confronted scabs at the local Verizon Headquarters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workers went on strike after Verizon, taking advantage of the current economy and widespread attacks on the working class, demanded concessions from the workers while the company and its top executives have taken in billions of dollars in profits.  In fact, the company has made more than $15 billion in profits in the past four years while at the same time paying no federal income tax from 2009-2010 and instead receiving over $1 billion in tax refunds. The company was demanding that workers contribute more to healthcare costs, the elimination of pensions, a reduction in sick pay and elimination of Veteran&amp;rsquo;s and Martin Luther King day as paid holidays. Further, the company was pushing to have more work outsourced to non-union workers.  As a result of these demands the negotiations broke down and 45,000 workers from CWA and IBEW walked out, including 6,000 in Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times tensions rose during the picket as scabs exited the building.  At one point food was delivered to the workers inside by the notoriously exploitative Upper Crust Pizza, who previously had their windows smashed on May Day because of their abuse of workers. Picketers attempted to block the delivery of the food while police protected those making the delivery. Tempers flared and at one point 100s of sodas were knocked from a palate and later thrown at the delivery van.  Workers also attempted to encircle and block the van until finally cops and union bosses convinced them to let the van flee the scene. The picketers showed a degree of militancy and class outrage not commonly seen at other pickets and labor rallies.  One Verizon worker who was not familiar with the IWW was given a  flyer explaining the position of the IWW and was very receptive. The Verizon workers plan on being out on the picket lines every day for at least two weeks. The Boston branch plans on supporting them as long as the strike continues while at the same time spreading the idea of revolutionary unionism to the rank and file workers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Workers at AT&amp;T Poised to Strike - Job action would be biggest U.S. strike in recent years, and first under Obama</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4677</link>
 <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/photos/color/events/IMG_6973.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;By x359209 - IU 560 Job Shop (dual card CWA)
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IWW/CWA dual-carders in the heart of the struggle&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
At midnight April 5, 2009 contracts for most of the component groups represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) at the 
telecom giant AT&amp;amp;T have expired. After weeks of mobilizing, around 90,000 
workers are poised to strike one of the largest and most profitable 
multinational corporations. A job action by CWA would be the largest and among the 
most significant labor action in the United States since the UPS strike in 1997. It would also be the first major strike under the Obama regime. 
The brewing confrontation could set the tone for class struggle in the 
U.S. for the near future.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Attack on Healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
AT&amp;amp;T has been pressing hard for major concessions from its call 
center, billing &amp;amp; ordering, and technical workers, especially in the area 
of health care. The company is demanding harsh cost shifting in the form 
of premiums and huge deductables for current employees and even steeper 
cuts for “second tier” workers hired going forward. AT&amp;amp;T is also 
demanding concessions in areas of seniority, over-time, and discipline. Raises 
would be replaced for the first two years by one-time lump payments.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Billions in Profit&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
AT&amp;amp;T corporate PR hacks have been spinning that healthcare must be 
reduced to avoid a repeat of what has happened to the U.S. auto industry. But 
AT&amp;amp;T is not General Motors. It is in a growing, innovative industry - one 
where AT&amp;amp;T bosses made $12.9 Billion in profits in 2008 alone. Besides, the 
U.S. healthcare crisis and its skyrocketing costs are not the fault of 
workers and their families and we should not be made to shoulder its burden. Workers at AT&amp;amp;T are furious that such a rich company would attack 
their families’ access to healthcare.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>A new online battleground for union campaigns</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3156</link>
 <description> &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Eric Lee - &lt;em&gt;Industrial Worker&lt;/em&gt;, February 2007; originally published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ericlee.info/2007/01/a_new_online_battleground_for.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/objects/media2.gif&quot; /&gt;Several years ago, shortly after it was launched I looked into Google&#039;s keyword-based online advertising as a tool for trade union campaigns. I thought it seemed a really good idea, tested it, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ericlee.info/2003/05/google_and_online_campaigning.html&quot;&gt;promoted its use to unions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, I think that more and more unions and campaigning organizations recognize that by using Google ads, we can send out a subversive message about corporations at a very low price to a very large audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3156&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Success to Report</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2843</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;236&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/IU560/local23A.jpg&quot; /&gt;Do Internet campaigns work? Can solidarity be successful? Are the old time values expressed by members of the Industrial Workers of the Word-- &amp;quot;An Injury To One Is An Injury To All&amp;quot;-- still applicable in this era of globalization? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There is a school of thought that the Internet &amp;quot;isn&#039;t real life,&amp;quot; and therefore, isn&#039;t nearly as vital as face to face organizing. While this assessment retains much validity, events this past week in Colorado and, in a sense, all over the world suggest that using the Internet can have a significant impact on the lives of working people. Online activists from Israel, Canada, Turkey, Sweden, Australia, the UK, Portugal, the Czech Republic, and Russia joined Americans to &amp;quot;write&amp;quot; a wrong committed against two American workers, using Internet messaging as their favorite solidarity tool.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On the way to the annual Rainbow Family Gathering near Steamboat Springs, Colorado, Giles Charle of Somersworth, New Hampshire and David Siller of Wayne, Pennsylvania went dumpster diving in the heart of the popular ski resort. Police detained them with a few fruits and vegetables liberated from the trash at Sweet Pea Produce, and promptly jailed them. They bonded out after three days to await trial. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Rainbow Family has a very mixed reputation among the citizenry in upscale Steamboat Springs. The so-called &amp;quot;neo-hippies&amp;quot; are viewed as outsiders, and the fine citizens of middle America tend to be uncomfortable with alternative lifestyles. The Rainbow Family also routinely thumbs its collective nose at authority by ignoring forest service requirements for camping permits. Some clashes with authorities were reported at this gathering, as in the past, so the Assistant District Attorney prosecuting the dumpster diving case wanted to &amp;quot;make examples&amp;quot; in order to &amp;quot;send a message to the community.&amp;quot; Under the circumstances, defense lawyers advised the two men to accept a misdemeanor plea bargain with a six month jail sentence, in order to avoid much more serious felony charges resulting from a reported, but non-existent burglary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Individuals from the Rainbow Family were incensed with the penalty and began to deluge city officials and the Steamboat Springs newspaper with emails and phone calls. The Drudge Report linked to the community newspaper&#039;s website, which momentarily crashed as thirty thousand people tried to read the story. Meanwhile, one of the co-owners of the produce establishment spoke out in support of the two men, and against their sentence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Yet the Routt County District Attorney&#039;s office aggressively defended their actions. On Tuesday District Attorney Bonnie Roesink and her assistant met before county commissioners and appeared pathologically obsessed with the idea that the only &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; facts in a prosecution case are those described in the initial police report. The D.A. also decried the media attention, calling it misguided and ill-informed, and lashed out at the owners of Sweet Pea Produce for not supporting the lengthy sentence after having (mistakenly) reported a burglary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There seemed to be every indication the D.A. planned to stick by the outcome of the case. But more than anything else, that September 6 presentation to the county commissioners called into question the accuracy of a police report riddled with false allegations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Fellow Worker Richard Myers has never been to a Rainbow Family event, but his awareness of this year&#039;s gathering was heightened when he performed some bindery work for the group&#039;s membership guide at an IWW print shop in Denver.&amp;nbsp; An experienced graphic designer and denizen of the Internet, he elected to play a role in this drama. Myers believed that in order to be successful, the protest needed to go well beyond the Rainbow Family, so he launched an Internet campaign to free the two from jail. On Sunday afternoon, two days before the District Attorney&#039;s office went public, Myers set up an online petition, created a web page calling for action, and bombarded cyberspace with hundreds of emails, initially circulating the alarm on nearly fifty email lists. FW Myers reports having spent several eighteen hour days at the keyboard to get the word out. Wobblies, peace and justice folks, SDS&#039;ers, Food Not Bombs, and many other activists joined the Rainbow Family protest, responding to the simple declaration that &amp;quot;Hunger Is Not A Crime!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In Tuesday&#039;s Steamboat Pilot, ski resort spokeswoman Riley Polumbus alluded to the industry&#039;s growing concerns about a possible boycott. On Wednesday morning Rocky Mountain News Columnist Bill Johnson picked up on the protest campaign and observed that &amp;quot;something&#039;s rotten in the story of the &#039;stolen&#039; trash,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;somewhere, somehow, someone is flat lying their face off.&amp;quot; Also on Wednesday, the Steamboat Pilot editorially recommended reversing the plea agreement. Steamboat Springs residents and a couple of city council members had become vociferous in their criticism, and the Pilot reported that &amp;quot;several community members have started a group to recall District Attorney Bonnie Roesink.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Under intense public pressure, the district attorney volunteered to set up a citizen&#039;s oversight committee to watch over her department&#039;s activities. On Wednesday afternoon the Assistant D.A. finally caved to the outcry and released the two young men, citing &amp;quot;what the public believes&amp;quot; as partial justification for his decision. Altogether, the pair served just ten days of their 180 day sentence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FW Myers has since met David and Giles and describes them as polite, thoughtful and articulate. They&#039;re interested in careers in social work and teaching, but their thoughts are also turning with interest to this world of solidarity and activism that helped to spring them from jail. Meanwhile&amp;nbsp; the struggle to free them is recounted on the webpage used to rally the Internet campaign:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rebelgraphics.org/coloradofreedom.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.rebelgraphics.org/coloradofreedom.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The KPFA Labor Collective has been producing labor programming at KPFA for more than three years. The collective has members from SEIU 1000, NALC 214, SEIU 616, IBT 70, IUOE 39, SEUI UHW, and other locals.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;At present, KPFA has 20 minutes a week of regular labor programming. The San Francisco Labor Council, the Contra Costa Labor Council, SEIU 790, SEIU 616 and other locals have endorsed calls for more labor programming. Hundreds of trade unionists have signed petitions for a weekly one hour labor show called &amp;quot;Workweek&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;For more information and background on the Program Council and the KPFA  Labor Collective, see my statement below, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kpfalaborcollective.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.kpfalaborcollective.org&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;redbar&quot;&gt;Upcoming KPFA ELECTION MEMBERSHIP DEADLINE - September 1, 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;Elections for the KPFA Local Station Board (LSB) will be held at the end of this year. Ballots are scheduled to be sent out October 16, and must be received back by Pacifica (NOT postmarked) by November 15.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;More urgently, to vote, or to be a candidate, you must be a KPFA member of record on September 1. Make sure your membership is current!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;To join or renew your membership, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kpfa.org/pledge&quot;&gt;http://www.kpfa.org/pledge&lt;/a&gt; , or call 800-439-5732 or  510-848-5732.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;Although most of the world allows same-day registration for voting, and the federal government requires registration 30 days before an election, the Pacifica bylaws require listeners to be members 45 days in advance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;redbar&quot;&gt;SI SE PUEDE! - A statement by Riva Enteen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2812&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
