 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the Northeast Ohio Industrial Workers of the World - March 13, 2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Northeast Ohio Industrial Workers of the World, we salute the Cleveland Teachers Union and the students and families of Cleveland, Ohio in their stand against Mayor Frank Jackson&amp;rsquo;s school reform initiative simply referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Cleveland Plan.&amp;rdquo; This plan, if one can call it such, has no data or research showing how any of the &amp;ldquo;reforms&amp;rdquo; would increase student learning or make the Cleveland Municipal School District (CMSD) any better. Scapegoating teachers is a failed tactic, especially in a district such as Cleveland where teachers have lowered their own pay by $25 million and pushed for innovative reforms in teacher evaluation and collaborative work environments. The problem in the CMSD is not the staff, it is poverty. It is not only economic poverty destroying so many communities, but also the craven poverty of spirit that seeks simple answers to difficult questions and uses Cleveland&amp;rsquo;s children as pawns yet again in another untested reform package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/northeast-ohio-industrial-workers-world-resolution-behalf-teachers-cleveland-municipal-schoo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
