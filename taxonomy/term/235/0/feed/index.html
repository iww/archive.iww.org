 <title>Local Worker-Owned Restaurant Joins Historic Labor Union: Act signifies workers&#039; real desire for change, not just rhetoric</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/local-worker-owned-restaurant-joins-historic-labor-union-act-signifies-workers-real-desire-c</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;May 9, 2010: Grand Rapids, MI - Bartertown Diner and Roc&#039;s Cakes--a raw, vegan/vegetarian restaurant opening in a couple weeks in downtown Grand Rapids has decided to go &quot;wobbly.&quot; The seven member team which constitutes the worker-run establishment have all decided to join the old and storied Industrial Workers of the World labor union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It just seemed like the perfect fit for us. After meeting with members of the IWW it was clear that we all want the same things and being that we really don&#039;t want to be just another restaurant it seemed logical,&quot; said Ryan Cappelletti cook at the new Diner.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Bartertown Diner and Roc&#039;s Cakes, which will be located at 6 Jefferson St., joins a growing list of worker-owned IWW shops. The Red and Black Cafe in Portland, Oregon and Just Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin being two others.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are very happy that Bartertown and Roc&#039;s Cakes has decided to go IWW and believe it can only help in our larger campaign to raise the standard of living and benefits for all food and beverage workers in Grand Rapids, said Shannon Williams, Treasurer of the local IWW branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/local-worker-owned-restaurant-joins-historic-labor-union-act-signifies-workers-real-desire-c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>IWW holds Solidarity picket in Grand Rapids for Jimmy John’s workers</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5181</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://griid.org/2010/09/06/iww-holds-solidarity-picket-in-grand-rapids-for-jimmy-johns-workers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;By Jeff Smith - GRIID, September 6, 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU640/jj1.jpeg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Today, 10 members of the local chapter of the IWW and a few supporters stood in the rain outside of the Jimmy John’s restaurant in Eastown today to show support for a new national effort to unionize fast food restaurant chain in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IWW members received primarily positive responses from people walking and driving by the Jimmy John’s location on Wealthy Street near the intersection of Lake Dr and Wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite sending out a Media Release to dozens of local news agencies, the only coverage of the solidarity picket came from Indy media sources, &lt;i&gt;GRIID&lt;/i&gt; and a citizen journalist with the &lt;i&gt;Rapidian&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;WZZM 13&lt;/i&gt; did run a story about the planned picket yesterday, but no commercial news agencies showed up today, despite the obvious tie in to Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>I.W.W Union to picket in front of Wealthy St. Jimmy John&#039;s on Labor Day</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5169</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wzzm13.com/news/news_story.aspx?storyid=130011&amp;catid=14&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;By Brent Ashcroft - WZZM13.com, September 6, 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU640/fists-raisedsm.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Grand Rapids, Mi. (WZZM) - Demands for improvements to working conditions have some Jimmy John&#039;s employees unionizing around the nation. One West Michigan location will be a test-ground on Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About twenty I.W.W (Industrial Workers of the World) members, from the Grand Rapids chapter, will picket in front of the Wealthy St. Jimmy John&#039;s Monday from noon to 1pm, representing the franchise&#039;s employees across the nation who feel they&#039;re underappreciated in the workplace, in support of the Jimmy John&#039;s labor dispute in Minneapolis which started it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of Jimmy John&#039;s workers are asked to work one and two hour shifts, or are expected to put wear and tear on their vehicles without compensation,&quot; says Cole Dorsey, Grand Rapids organizer of the I.W.W. &quot;It&#039;s difficult to get sick days or to get job-related workman&#039;s compensation [from Jimmy John&#039;s management].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Dorsey and the rest of the Grand Rapids I.W.W. will represent area Jimmy John&#039;s employees in protest Monday. Leafleting and picketing is planned for 32 of the 39 states in which Jimmy John&#039;s operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minneapolis Jimmy John&#039;s co-owner, Mike Mulligan said in a statement last week: &quot;We are very proud of our employment record in Minneapolis and take issue with the claims of the I.W.W. We value our relationship with our employees and offer competitive wages and good local jobs. We are dedicated to providing a fair, equal and diverse workplace environment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorsey, and his I.W.W. members, don&#039;t see it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sexual harrassment, better pay, benefits for non-managerial employees - that&#039;s what the union workers, the sisters and brothers in Minneapolis, want from us on Labor Day,&quot; says Dorsey.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Grand Rapids Wobbly Participates in Occupation of Senator Levin&#039;s Office in Response to Troop Escalation in Afghanistan</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4870</link>
 <description>

Why We Occupied Senator Levin’s Office

Today, we occupied Senator Carl Levin’s office in Grand Rapids as a protest against the current administration’s decision to escalate the US war in Afghanistan. We do this not simply because we are against war, but because this decision by the Obama administration is unjust.


The US is not in Afghanistan to bring Democracy – Since 1979, the US has supported anti-democratic forces such as the Mujahadeen, the Northern Alliance, the Taliban and a variety of individual warlords. The US has also supported the current regime of Karzai, knowing full well that his administration has been corrupt from the beginning.

 <title>Starbucks Settles ULP Charges Over Firing At Michigan Store, But Union Refuses to Sign</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4587</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/u&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The opinions of the author do not necessarily match those of the IWW.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image pictured to the right did not appear in the original article, we have added it here to provide a visual perspective. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is reposted in accordance to Fair Use guidelines. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/d16_article1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
A National Labor Relations Board regional director in Detroit Jan. 16 
approved a settlement agreement with Starbucks Corp. resolving allegations of 
unfair labor practices by the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU), an affiliate of the 
Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), filed with NLRB Region 7 (Starbucks Corp. 
d/b/a Starbucks Coffee Co., N.L.R.B. Reg. Dir., No. 7-CA-51190, settlement 
approved 1/16/09).
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The NLRB regional office in Detroit had found sufficient evidence to 
establish an employer violation of the National Labor Relations Act at a 
Starbucks store in Grand Rapids, Mich., according to Stephen Glasser, NLRB 
regional director for Region 7.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) filed several charges April 
15, one of which NLRB found to be a possible violation of the act. On behalf of 
fired worker Cole Dorsey, SWU claimed Starbucks illegally fired a worker who had 
been involved in union activities.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Glasser said NLRB concluded there was sufficient evidence to establish 
Dorsey was fired for his union activities and support for the union. &amp;quot;We thought 
we could prove that,&amp;quot; he told BNA Jan. 9. Starbucks had said it fired Dorsey for 
attendance issues, Glasser said.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reinstatement Not Required.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Under the settlement, reached one day before a trial was to be held, 
Starbucks will expunge record of the termination from the employee&#039;s personnel 
file and will post a notice for 60 days at the Grand Rapids, Mich., store 
outlining employees&#039; rights under the NLRA.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Under the settlement, Starbucks is not required to reinstate the employee 
or issue back pay. Although the union had sought Dorsey&#039;s reinstatement, NLRB 
determined that it would not be appropriate, Glasser said.
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Starbucks Caves in to Avoid Today&#039;s Trial on Fellow Worker Dorsey&#039;s Termination</title>

&lt;strong&gt;By Melissa Allison - &lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt; business reporter, Jan. 6, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Starbucks has reached a settlement in principle over a Michigan barista 
whom the National Labor Relations Board said was fired in June because of his 
union activities.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
An administrative trial that was scheduled for today has been canceled, and 
the agreement is expected to be signed this week, said Chet Byerly, resident 
officer for the NLRB in Grand Rapids. He would not disclose details of the 
proposed agreement.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed that it is working on a 
settlement.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
It is the third time in a month that Starbucks has faced action from the 
NLRB regarding the Industrial Workers of the World union.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Last month, an NLRB administrative law judge found that Starbucks took part 
in unfair labor practices at several of its New York cafes.
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Starbucks facing third anti-union case in Michigan</title>

&lt;strong&gt;Starbucks is to begin proceedings Wednesday in a third case in which it 
allegedly fired a barista because of his union activities.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
By Melissa Allison, January 6, 2009 - &lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt; business reporter
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The union lumps keep coming for Starbucks, which was thumped by the 
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) last month for unfair labor practices at 
several New York cafes.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Last week, the company settled a separate NLRB dispute in Michigan and on 
Wednesday is to begin proceedings there in a third case in which it allegedly 
fired a barista because of his union activities.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
All three cases were initiated by baristas affiliated with the Industrial 
Workers of the World (IWW), a century-old union that has worked for several 
years to improve conditions for Starbucks workers.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
In New York, an administrative-law judge with the NLRB said last month that 
work rules were unfairly imposed on employees who supported the union. The 
coffee chain was ordered to give back jobs to three former workers and 
compensate them for lost earnings. The company also must post notices informing 
employees of their labor-organizing rights.
&lt;/div&gt;
