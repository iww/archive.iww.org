 <title>&#039;One Big Union&#039; Still Relevant Today</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/879</link>
 <description>&lt;strong&gt;By John Nichols - The &lt;em&gt;Wisconsin Capital Times&lt;/em&gt;, May 12, 2005&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Six baristas at the Vox Pop coffee shop in Brooklyn went Wobbly in March.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When the people who make lattes and sell books at the shop joined the New York City Retail Workers Union Branch 660 of the Industrial Workers of the World - the Wobblies - they linked up with a union that is celebrating 100 years of radicalism.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There are not many unions that go out of their way to organize workers at independent coffee shops and bookstores these days, and there are even fewer unions that young people think of as cool. But the IWW has always stood out from the rest of the union movement.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Formed in 1905 by the likes of Mother Jones, Eugene Victor Debs, Big Bill Haywood and Lucy Parsons, the IWW declared from the start that it would stand &amp;quot;upon the basic principle that the way to unite the workers is to organize them as a class, upon class interests, and not for the purpose of securing for the present a paltry few crumbs from the table of Capitalism to a privileged few within the pure and simple unions, but that all may enjoy the fruits of their industry and the fullness thereof.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/879&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generation Debt: The New Economics of Being Young - You make chump  change. And Congress likes it that way; By Anya Kamenetz - &lt;em&gt;Village  Voice&lt;/em&gt;, March 18th, 2005.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;graphics/IU660/voxpop/kamanetz.jpg&quot; /&gt;Just off Coney Island Avenue, in Ditmas Park, among the car  washes and Pakistani sweet shops, there sits a lefty coffeehouse that  seems to have dropped in from Williamsburg or maybe Seattle. Inside, the  walls are painted an inviting shade of yellow; undulating, handmade  bookshelves feature local zines. One of the store&#039;s bestsellers is  &lt;em&gt;America (The Book)&lt;/em&gt;, by the creators of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt;. A  small latte is $3, 10 cents less than at Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vox Pop, as the caf&amp;eacute; is called, is the anti-Starbucks in more  ways than one. On March 1, its six employees, led by 18-year-old Emmy  Gilbert, announced that they had joined the Industrial Workers of the  World&#039;s NYC Retail Workers Union, IU 660. &amp;quot;Vox Pop workers decided we  wanted to take the shop&#039;s motto of democracy to its fullest extent,&amp;quot;  Gilbert said. &amp;quot;And the IWW doesn&#039;t think organizing retail is futile.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sander Hicks, who opened Vox Pop in November, may be the first boss to  summon the revolutionary anarcho-syndicalist forces on behalf of his own  workers. He is best known as the founder of Soft Skull Press, the  respected underground imprint; the caf&amp;eacute;-bookstore is a physical  extension of his ideals about politics and community. After consulting  with the IWW, Hicks settled on a starting wage of $10 an hour. &amp;quot;If we pay  people $6 an hour we&#039;re going to get a low level of job love, people  stealing from you, attacking customers,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;How can we not afford  to pay more?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/826&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
