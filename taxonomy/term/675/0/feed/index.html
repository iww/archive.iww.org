Beaver wore a T-shirt saying, &amp;quot;Not my president.&amp;quot; Various piercings, tattoos, red-streaked hair. One smoked a cigar, another a pipe. One carried a police-style riot shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Stuckey, another organizer, showed up a bit late. &amp;quot;It&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve ever worked on May Day,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had passed out Spanish-language pamphlets at bus stops, near the John Morrell plant and other places where Hispanic workers were likely to gather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the activists waited, the discussion wandered from Cinco de Mayo to using cell phones to tell what time it is (&amp;quot;Man, you&#039;re paying $40 a month for a watch&amp;quot;) to a new kind of dog food that reduces poop, then turned to the U.S. economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;There&#039;s maybe 20 years max before this country falls into the Third World&amp;quot; if we don&#039;t recover manufacturing jobs, Stuckey opined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 5:15, Stuckey went to his vehicle to pull out signs and literature. Chris Huska of Act Now to Stop War &amp;amp; End Racism exchanged pamphlets with Stuckey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they stood near Minnesota Avenue with signs, there were a few honks - hard to tell whether in accord or in anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the immigrants the group was trying to help showed up. But South Dakota&#039;s low pay and dearth of unions will keep these activists passing out workers rights pamphlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It&#039;s needed here quite a bit,&amp;quot; Beaver said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
