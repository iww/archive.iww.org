However, Glasgow University had a surplus of &amp;pound;2 million this year and the principal, Sir Muir Russell, has just awarded himself a massive increase.&amp;nbsp; Crichton was also not properly funded from the start and lacks some of the facilities that other campuses make money out of. Most important, universities should not be about money and making a profit.&amp;nbsp; Universities should be about education and research, about opening up opportunities and changing lives.&amp;nbsp; Crichton is doing this - opening up opportunities for people, changing their lives and being a focus and source of pride to the local community and hopes to continue to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3265&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
