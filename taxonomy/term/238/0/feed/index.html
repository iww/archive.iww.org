 <title>Take Action: Starbucks Barista Homeless After Racist Demotion</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3502</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;221&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/1792.jpg&quot; /&gt;Sisters and Brothers: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simone Gordon and the IWW Starbucks Workers Union  [StarbucksUnion.org] need your solidarity now. Ms.  Gordon is homeless and on welfare after Starbucks  demoted her from shift supervisor to barista on New  Year&amp;rsquo;s Day and cut her schedule to a stunning five  hours per week. Simone&amp;rsquo;s store manager, Graham  Higgins, falsely accused Ms. Gordon, who is  African-American, of being racist against white people  and stated that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t fit to be a leader in the  store. The allegation that Ms. Gordon is racist is so  patently absurd that we won&amp;rsquo;t even dignify it with a  response.  Suffice it to say, Simone Gordon, who has a  white grandparent, opposes all forms of  discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3502&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Thoughts after a Food Not Bombs Sharing</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/1078</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.infoshop.org&quot;&gt;InfoShop.org&lt;/a&gt;, there was an article on how the FBI now has Food Not&amp;nbsp; Bombs on the terrorist watch list. Strange but true. I had a chance to think about it during our regular Saturday sharing in Hackensack today.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Every Saturday about a dozen of us, SPers, IWW members and some youth from the Bergen County area meet in our (Andrea &amp;amp; my) kitchen, and cook up vegan food which would normally be tossed by local markets. Food that&#039;s tossed because it&#039;s not perfect or (in the case of fruits or vegetables) slightly bruised. The idea is that there is more than enough out there already to feed everyone, and that this food should not be thrown away because theres no market for it. Food is a basic need that should be a right not a privilege.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This morning while setting up out table in Hackensack I noticed the same person (identified as a cop by the local homeless population) watching us, and I hear he has harassed some of the local folks that go to our sharings (whats your name, where do you live, etc.) Guess the word came down and we are now officially being watched. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Today&#039;s Subversive Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/1078&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
