 <title>Portland May Day 2017 — Official Response</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/portland-may-day-2017-%E2%80%94-official-response</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the Portland IWW - &lt;a href=&quot;http://portlandiww.org/2017/05/portland-may-day-2017-official-response/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Portland IWW&lt;/a&gt;, May 4, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/xPortland-LOGO.png.pagespeed.ic.eyvHj59-oJ.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This was originally sent to KOIN 6 as a response to the events that took place on May Day in Portland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Workers of the World is proud that we were able to celebrate International Workers Day and march in solidarity with so many organizations which are essential and vibrant to the community of Portland and at large. International Workers Day is an important holiday that showcases the struggle of all workers against the wholesale societal systemic oppression brought about by corporations, CEOs, and the mega-rich capitalist class. The fact that there was such a strong contingent of marchers from all walks of life is representative of the American working class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Portland Police Bureau&amp;rsquo;s use of violence against workers and their families &amp;ndash; as well as the children who were in the crowd celebrating the holiday with their parents &amp;ndash; is a travesty and a violation of both human rights, as well as the right to peaceful assembly. We condemn their efforts in restricting accessibility to fellow workers with disabilities, and their blatant disregard for the health and well-being of the people they have sworn to protect. By direct contrast, they assisted visible white supremacists and white nationalists at the &amp;ldquo;March for Free Speech 82nd Ave,&amp;rdquo; specifically a non-permitted march by pro-Trump supporters on April 29th by chartering Tri-Met buses and public transportation to get these people, some of whom were making Nazi salutes during their protest, back to their vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is and has always been to support and assist the workers of the world, and we will continue to fight for the needs of all in the face of police and capitalist oppression, and stand by our watchword that an injury to one is an injury to all. As such, the Portland Police Bureau inflicted shameful injury against the workers, their families, and their children during the May Day march; we will stand against that in solidarity with our fellow workers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>One Class, One Struggle! Undocumented and Documented Workers Unite on May Day</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/one-class-one-struggle-undocumented-and-documented-workers-unite-may-day</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Patrick O&amp;rsquo;Donoghue - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://tcorganizer.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/one-class-one-struggle-undocumented-and-citizen-workers-unite-on-may-day/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Organizer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, May 1, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWMayDay.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;A Day of Resistance!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is May Day, or as we in the labor movement call it, International Worker&amp;rsquo;s Day- a day of celebration and resistance for working class people. It is a day not only of looking forward to the future, but also remembering the lessons of the past. May Day commemorates&amp;nbsp;the struggle&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;Haymarket Martyrs, a group of labor organizers, most of them immigrants, executed in Chicago for their work in the Eight Hour Day movement. The Eight Hour Day was the first time that workers around the world joined together in one campaign, supporting each other&amp;rsquo;s strikes and protests around a&amp;nbsp;single demand- reduce the work day to eight hours, without a cut in pay. The movement faced violence and arrests from governments, but eventually won in country after country. The eight hour day became the basic work day for workers across the countries where the movement fought, with victories across Europe, North and South America, Australia, Iran, Japan, and elsewhere. Over a century ago, workers realized the power we have when we refuse to be divided by borders, industry, or race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This May Day is also the Day Without Immigrants. It is the latest in a wave of of day strike&amp;nbsp;by immigrant workers- not only to protest&amp;nbsp;wages and work conditions, but also to protest the Trump&amp;rsquo;s plans to increase deportations.&amp;nbsp;Under the Trump&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/politics/immigration-arrests-rise/&quot;&gt;ramping up&lt;/a&gt; of the Obama administration&amp;rsquo;s already record-breaking deportations, ICE has increasingly targeted previously protected DREAMers and other undocumented people&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration-arrests-of-noncriminals-double-under-trump/2017/04/16/98a2f1e2-2096-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html?utm_term=.e7dd9246fd5a&quot;&gt;not otherwise criminalized&lt;/a&gt; by the state. ICE raids are becoming&amp;nbsp;more regular even in &amp;ldquo;Sanctuary Cities&amp;rdquo;, and more of our neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends are being&amp;nbsp;captured, torn from their homes, forced through &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/us-deaths-immigration-detention&quot;&gt;over-crowded detention centers&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;courts &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/deportation-and-due-process&quot;&gt;without due process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Twin Cities, many&amp;nbsp;of the actions today are organized&amp;nbsp;by CTUL, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://ctul.net/&quot;&gt;workers center for low wage workers of color&lt;/a&gt;, especially immigrant workers. Even more of the walk outs and sick outs are &amp;ldquo;wildcat&amp;rdquo; actions organized on the shop floor between undocumented workers, without needing the go-ahead from a union or organizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By striking, these undocumented workers are showing how important they are to making the world run. How many restaurants are shut down today because the back end staff didn&amp;rsquo;t come in? How many landscapers and construction companies who rely on day laborerers are not making money today? How many farm fields aren&amp;rsquo;t being worked? Every day, undocumented immigrant workers do some of the toughest jobs in America, and the country starts to grind to a halt without immigrant workers.&amp;nbsp;Deportations crackdowns have already left &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-06/crops-rot-while-trump-led-immigration-backlash-idles-farm-lobby&quot;&gt;millions of dollars of produce&lt;/a&gt; to rot in the fields in Alabama, Georgia, and California as farmers dependent on exploiting undocumented&amp;nbsp;workers can&amp;rsquo;t find Americans to work for as low as &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://nfwm.org/education-center/farm-worker-issues/low-wages/&quot;&gt;$10,000-$12,000 a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;year.&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;The four industries with the most undocumented workforce- agriculture, cleaning and maintenance, construction, and food preparation and service- are all expecting labor shortages if Trump&amp;rsquo;s deportation plan is carried out. American companies and bosses need our immigrant fellow workers- but the administration and parts of the press try to tell workers who are citizens that undocumented workers are hurting American working standards. Nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>May Day Greetings from the IWW</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/may-day-greetings-iww</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/ccgenstrikesm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Fellow Workers and Friends: the IWW bids the workers of the world everywhere a happy May Day, International Workers Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are likely May Day events happening in your community or a community near you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot (yet) hope to keep track of or list them all, but we&#039;re doing the best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good central resource is our &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/iww.org&quot;&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;, where we have attempted to share any May Day events organized or endorsed by various IWW branches, and--failing that--events in which IWW members are actively participating.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>May Day Resolution by the Los Angeles Ricardo Flores Magon General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/may-day-resolution-los-angeles-ricardo-flores-magon-general-membership-branch-industrial-wor</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWdrawing.smlr.preview.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Whereas&lt;/b&gt; increasing numbers of working class and dispossessed people in the United States have begun to meet face to face to proclaim their opposition to economic injustice and define their interests in democratic popular assemblies, autonomous from political parties, as part of the Occupy Movement, which resonates deeply with the IWW&#039;s traditions and principles, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whereas&lt;/b&gt; millions of working class and dispossessed people around the world, but especially in Northern Africa and Western Asia, have been organizing themselves to overthrow the governments that enforce the capitalist and neocolonial domination and exploitation they have resisted for generations, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whereas&lt;/b&gt; the IWW has stood since its founding in 1905 for the proposition that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as  a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.&amp;quot; and&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whereas&lt;/b&gt; since 2006 the tradition of the movement for the rights of migrant workers in the U.S. has been to mobilize themselves and their allies for mass actions on May 1 to disrupt the functioning of the economic system and political discourse of the 1%, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whereas&lt;/b&gt; every year May Day is celebrated globally as International Workers Day to commemorate the struggle of the international working class to emancipate itself through  the class war over the centuries, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whereas&lt;/b&gt; May Day 1890 was proclaimed to be an international day of working class protest by the Second International against the repression of the 8 Hour Day movement in the U.S. where 8 mostly immigrant anarchist labor organizers were arrested, with 4 being hanged and one committing suicide the night before the hangings, after an unknown person threw a bomb at police who were repressing a protest against police brutality in Haymarket Square in Chicago, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whereas&lt;/b&gt; the Los Angeles branch of the IWW welcomes this opportunity to organize alongside OccupyLA and other participants in the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition to help the working class build the skills, the community, and the combativeness necessary to defend ourselves, our elders, and the generations to come from the global threats of austerity, exploitation, imperialism and ecocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be it resolved that&lt;/b&gt; the LA Branch of the IWW endorses the May 1, 2012 General Strike and commits to work as part of the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition by conducting trainings and participating in actions in the lead up to May 1.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What Kind of May Day Do We Need this Year?</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/what-kind-may-day-do-we-need-year</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;content_authors&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.zcommunications.org/what-kind-of-may-day-do-we-need-this-year-by-daniel-gross&quot;&gt;By Daniel Gross -&amp;nbsp; Znet, Tuesday, April 19, 2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The self-sacrifice of a street vendor in Tunisia sparked the rage of a  nation including general strikes from independent unions which  successfully ousted the Ben-Ali dictatorship.&amp;nbsp; The garment workers of  Mahalla and their national day of action catalyzed the seeds of revolt  in Egypt.&amp;nbsp; Then with millions in the street and Hosni Mubarak  obstinately ensconced in his compound, mass industrial action from  workers across sectors and across Egypt broke the stalemate and ended a  30-year reign of oppression.&amp;nbsp; Popular revolts have spread throughout the  region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker launched extremist attacks on  public worker union rights for the benefit of corporate elites, the  example of the Egyptian and Tunisian achievements inspired workers to  actions with a scope and spirit unseen for decades in the U.S. labor  movement.&amp;nbsp; The persistent occupation of the Capitol and enthusiastic  solidarity from far and wide proved that the sense of self-worth and  fighting spirit of the American worker is alive and well.&amp;nbsp; A General  Strike is being discussed by workers in states around the country, not  as a historical relic, but as a practical, effective, and needed tool to  deal with problems at work and in the political system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the attacks on public and private sector unions escalate, the racist  scapegoating, exploitation, and deportation of immigrant workers  continues apace.&amp;nbsp; Right-wing legislators in states across the country  are pursuing the Arizona show-me-your-papers racial profiling model  which undermines the liberty and offends the dignity of every working  person.&amp;nbsp; Employers enrich themselves for years on the hard work of  immigrant employees only to cynically raise status issues when  confronted with demands for stolen wages or for decent working  conditions.&amp;nbsp; Yet still, immigrant workers of color are routinely  demonstrating the courage to lead some of the most profound and  hard-fought labor campaigns in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On May 1, 2006, millions of immigrant workers and their allies poured  into the streets from coast to coast with tremendous spirit and energy  to give May Day life again after decades of slumber in the country in  which it was born.&amp;nbsp; Regrettably, many corners of the labor movement  shied away from this watershed moment which featured large numbers of  workers actually striking their jobs without even the protection of  union membership.&amp;nbsp; The achievement of International Workers Day in 2006  has yet to be duplicated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The combination of existential challenges and historic opportunities  facing workers indicates only one appropriate response on May 1, 2011:  everyone together in the streets against the attacks on immigrants,  public and private sector unions, and all working people.&amp;nbsp; A new network  of over fifty leading worker and community-based organizations, May Day  United, has been hard at work building just this type of dynamic May  1st under the banner of &amp;quot;A Day Without Workers&amp;quot; and a call for, &amp;quot;No  Work, No Shopping, and No School-Related Activities.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; May 1st falls on a  Sunday this year which should help facilitate the participation of many  working families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;WHEREAS the attack of Governor Scott Walker on Wisconsin&#039;s public workers and their labor unions is an attack on every U.S. working family;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;WHEREAS isolated efforts at reform have failed to stem the growing tide of corporate power and the harm it causes to hard-working men and women across the nation;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>May 1: International Worker’s Day - Día Internacional de los Trabajadores</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4706</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;By Adam Welch - originally posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://machete408.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/may-1-international-worker%E2%80%99s-day-dia-internacional-de-los-trabajadores/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/anarchism/haymarket-square-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;284&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet again May Day quickly approaches.
Since 2006 the immigrant rights marches- made up of millions of
undocumented migrant workers along with their supporters, families and
children- has brought back May 1st to its original roots in the US. But
many are still unaware of its origins in US labor history and the
impact this commemorative day still has internationally- such as you
can still walk into neighborhoods in Mexico and find streets such as&lt;/em&gt; “Calle Los Mártires de Chicago”&lt;em&gt; (Martyrs of Chicago Street).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;  Below is a short, pamphlet length piece I edited on the origins and radical history of May Day. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;For an in depth look you might try Paul Avrich’s classic &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Haymarket-Tragedy-Paul-Avrich/dp/0691006008/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1240829652&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Haymarket Tragedy”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and AK Press offers a listing of books they carry on the subject &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.akpress.org/search?action=find_book&amp;amp;search_key=title&amp;amp;query=haymarket&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  -AW

&lt;strong&gt;What is May Day and why is it called International Workers Day?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
May
1st, International Worker’s Day, commemorates the historic struggle of
working people throughout the world, and is recognized in every country
except the United States and Canada. This is despite the fact that the
holiday began in the 1880’s in the United States, with the fight for an
eight-hour work day led by immigrant workers. The recent historic
marches and protests for immigrant rights, which began with “El Gran
Paro Americano 2006,” have brought back into our memories May 1 as an
important day of struggle. Although the history of the day has largely
been forgotten in the United States, it is still actively remembered
and celebrated today by workers, unionists and oppressed peoples all
over the world. In fact you can still walk through neighborhoods in
Mexico and find streets such as Calle Los Martires de Chicago in Oaxaca
City, Oaxaca, commemorating the leaders of the eight-hour day movement
who were imprisoned and executed.
&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>May 1st is International Workers Day!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4693</link>
 <description>&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Happy International Workers’ Day!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

Dear Friend,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

This Friday, May 1st, is YOUR day, a day to celebrate all working people.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

Please take a moment to thank your co-workers, friends, and family members for all the hard work they do every day.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

Many people don’t know about the history of May 1st as a workers’ holiday. Here is some information on the roots of May 1st, also called May Day.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

ORIGINS&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

The origins of International Workers’ Day go back to 1886, when hundreds of thousands workers across the United States went on strike. Workers demanded that their 10- and 12-hour workdays be shortened to an 8-hour day with no reduction in pay. Over the next few years, thousands of workers won the 8-hour workday that many of us still enjoy today.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

REMEMBERING THE HAYMARKET MARTYRS&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

We also celebrate in memory of the Haymarket massacre, in which eight labor activists were framed and put on trial by the government. On May 4, 1886, there was a rally at Chicago’s Haymarket Square in support of striking workers from a nearby factory.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

 <title>May Day 2007 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3401</link>
 <description>&amp;ldquo;I had to be here for my gente,&amp;rdquo; said Linda, a Mexican American educator who came from the far south side of Pittsburgh.&amp;rdquo; Her knee operation did not stop her for coming in a wheel chair and bringing her two children and three grandchildren to the vigil and the march. &amp;ldquo;I support Pittsburgh Friends of Immigrants and I thank them for organizing this, it is needed in this city,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under a beautiful sunny day, this second May Day, International Workers&#039; Day, Pastor Linda Theophilus of PFOI and the Detention Watch Network once again honored the 1.8 million deportees since 1996 in our country. She read personal stories and statements of families separated by raids and deportations and at the end of each, her chant, a national immigrants&#039; rights chant, resounded through the streets adjacent to the jail which were later taken to the streets by the protestors: Immigrants Rights: Are Human Rigthts! Immigrants Rights: Are Human Rights!&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3401&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
