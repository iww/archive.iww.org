 <title>Holding the line: informal pace setting in the workplace</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;460&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/BreakdownPoster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Often when talking to people about their frustrations at work and the  prospects for organizing, a common response is one of negativity and  desperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I could never get anything goin&amp;rsquo; where I work!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Other people don&amp;rsquo;t care.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It would be too hard.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of sentiments cut across industries and sectors. Even  folks in officially unionized workplaces that have unaddressed  grievances feel this way many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while your preconceived ideas of what workplace organizing  entails may clash with the obstacles you think of, other things going on  in your workplace perfectly mesh with what we commonly call &amp;lsquo;job  actions&amp;rsquo;. Slowdowns, work to rule and pace setting are all tactics that  workers have used in response to management doing ans saying things we  don&amp;rsquo;t like. Most commonly, nowadays, it seems like our coworkers do  these things as individuals, but when it expands beyond that&amp;hellip;well,  there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to get somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2010, I was working at a warehouse as a forklift driver in Iowa  City. Most of my day was spent on the shipping side of the building,  pulling pallets off the production lines and staging them in a different  area so they could eventually be loaded onto trucks. I also spent a  fair amount of time loading these trucks, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the majority of my interaction with co-workers was  limited to the other shipping forklift driver, the shipping manager and  2-3 temps who used a pallet jack to drop off pallets for me to stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping manager, Phil, was basically a &amp;lsquo;lead&amp;rsquo;, with little power  himself. Any power he had was mostly snitching power in that he  directly answered to the Warehouse Supervisor. Phil was in his mid 40s  and a casualty of the bad economy, being a recently laid of worker at a  factoiry that made parts for General Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
