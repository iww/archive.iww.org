 <title>Announcing the Little Big Union!</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally Published &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://olympiaiww.com/2019/03/16/announcing-the-little-big-union/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/LittleBig1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Workers  at Little Big Burger know that our safety, well-being, and  voices are  important. Every single day we serve customers, cook food,  bus tables,  and wash dishes. We have formed the Little Big Union to  ensure Little  Big Burger is truly inclusive of our collective voice as  workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland, Oregon is ground zero for fast food organizing.  We love this city and call the Pacific Northwest our home. However, rent  and the cost of living have continued to increase while our wages have  not. Now, it is increasingly difficult to live in the neighborhoods we  serve. This is why we are proud to stand in solidarity with the  Burgerville Workers Union, as members of the Industrial Workers of the  World, in the fight to make food service an honest, dignified, and  dependable job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Big Burger is no longer a small business, they were  acquired by North Carolina-based multinational corporation Chanticleer  Holdings in 2015. Us workers and our families depend on this job for our  livelihood, and we hope those who prepare the food, serve the guests,  and create the environment that has built Little Big Burger stand to  grow with our company. Workers continue to struggle by stretching our  paychecks month to month, surviving off minimum wage, unreliable tips,  and inconsistent schedules released often a day or two before we work.  We are proud of the hard work we provide Little Big Burger, which is why  we demand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;$5 raises&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fair and consistent scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Safe and Healthy workplaces&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Respectful and professional conduct from management&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Benefits like child care, paid parental leave, quality healthcare, food boxes, bus passes, parking passes, and shift beers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Paid sick leave and vacation time&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Worker autonomy to refuse service to abusive/dangerous customers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Holiday pay&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Transparent hiring and firing policies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sanctuary workplaces&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 <title>New York: Wobblies at Singing Restaurant Win Major Victory</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/new-york-wobblies-singing-restaurant-win-major-victory</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Stardust Family United - October 4, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/Stardust1_0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;In a major victory for the singing servers at Ellen&amp;rsquo;s Stardust Diner, their employer has reached an agreement with their solidarity union, Stardust Family United, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). By entering into the settlement agreement, the company will narrowly avoid a trial on some 19 violations of the National Labor Relations Act, including 31 retaliatory firings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, all 31 employees termina&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;ted over the last year in retaliation for union activity have been offered immediate and full reinstatement, and will receive back pay from the time they were fired. Of the terminated employees, 13 will immediately return to work at the popular Midtown diner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the restaurant is required to mail official notices to all employees, informing them that the company will not violate federal law by engaging in certain unlawful practices such as surveilling and threatening workers, interfering with their use of social media, and discouraging them from taking action to improve working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the singing servers, this has been a long road. The union, which is a branch of the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), initially went public in late summer of 2016. Weeks after making their efforts known to management, 16 active union members were fired. Over the fall and winter, the workers continued to engage in direct workplace action to improve health and safety conditions, as well as pursue other demands. Another mass firing in January 2017 brought the total of terminated singers up to 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Stardust Family United remained active, both inside and outside the restaurant. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled and proud to know our struggle and vigilance over the last year has paid off,&amp;rdquo; says returning employee Matthew Patterson. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to returning and making a positive impact inside the diner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Report Back from DC: Standing in Solidarity with Fellow Worker Julia Flores</title>

After 15 years of service, Whole Foods retaliated against Julia for collectively organizing to win back a fellow worker&amp;rsquo;s job. Since Julia&amp;rsquo;s wrongful termination, she has made several appeals to the company&amp;rsquo;s local and regional leadership only to be dismissed without justice. In December 2016, the manager who terminated Julia, Victor Vazquez, &amp;nbsp;was fired along with eight other managers, for &amp;lsquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/whole-foods-accused-of-cheating-workers-out-of-bonuses-in-class-action-lawsuit/2016/12/21/104dfd7c-c705-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?tid=a_inl&amp;amp;utm_term=.7cf71eea2358&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;stealing bonuses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Our picket was not only in support of Julia&amp;rsquo;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/nlrb-process&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; but to demand her reinstatement as well as restitution. &amp;nbsp;Our message to Whole Foods and the surrounding employers was clear: We, the workers of the District of Columbia, will not tolerate repression of fellow workers, retaliation for organizing our workplaces, or wage theft. An injury to one is an injury to all!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our coalition was comprised of around sixty comrades including members of Many Languages One Voice (MLOV), the Comit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;eacute;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the IWW and its General Defense Committee (GDC), the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), Socialist Alternative, Future is Feminist, DC Stampede, DC Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), and the Socialist Snack Squad. We assembled at 10:30 am to review our overall strategy, our contingency escalation plan, and individual roles. The fulcrum of the action was a delegation of five comrades that accompanied Julia to Whole Foods to present her demands to the store manager in advance of the picket. Unsurprisingly, Whole Foods refused to negotiate and demanded the delegation leave the store. While we had no illusion that the bosses had any intention of conceding, workers organizing an effective picket should clearly articulate their demands to both the bosses as well as to the wider community. &amp;nbsp;The delegation relayed the details of their meeting to the picket and then proceeded to canvas nearby businesses to put pressure on Whole Foods. At each stop the delegation explained the circumstances of Julia&amp;rsquo;s wrongful termination, Whole Food&amp;rsquo;s history of worker repression, and the delegation&amp;rsquo;s recent treatment by the store manager. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>“Proud to be part of a singing union”: the struggle at Ellen&#039;s Stardust Diner</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/%E2%80%9Cproud-be-part-singing-union%E2%80%9D-struggle-ellens-stardust-diner</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Chilli Sauce - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWStardust.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libcom.Org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, March 5, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWStardust.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Ellen&#039;s Stardust Diner is a New York institution, a place where Broadway actors not only wait tables, but sing show tunes while they&#039;re at it. It&#039;s also the site of an ongoing labor dispute that has seen mass firings, strikes, protests, and picket lines that have turned away early morning food deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employees at Ellen&#039;s have been organizing with the IWW for much of the past year. Their union, Stardust Family United, has been out on the streets, raising their voices and raising their fists to defend and improve working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Stardusters have worked at the restaurant on and off for years. To hear them tell it, Ellen&#039;s used to be a pretty nice place to work. Management were accommodating when it came to taking time off to be in a show. And despite the large numbers of wait staff and the time they take off for stage work, Ellen&#039;s was a tight-knit community. It was a place where workers developed their talents and built friendships that spanned decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that changed last year when new management was brought in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers ceased to be accommodating when it came to taking time off. Workers who raised safety issues or complained of sexual harassment were ignored or, worse yet, pushed out of the restaurant. Long-term workers, some whom had racked up years of service in the double digits, were unceremoniously let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea came about to form a union. Workers contacted a couple of local unions and the IWW proved the most responsive, quickly arranging an organizer training for the Stardust staff. The workers found the IWW&#039;s model of solidarity unionism, which stresses rank-and-file control and a direct action approach to organizing, to be an asset to the solidarity they&#039;d already built up in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, organizing occurred under the radar. Issues of health and safety were raised and workers used the internal communication system to pressure management. Workers also organized a successful march on the boss to get their tip bucket back and it was after this point the workers decided to go public as a union. The venue through which they chose to do this: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/nyregion/a-manhattan-diners-new-management-has-servers-singing-a-defiant-tune.html?_r=0&quot; class=&quot;bb-url&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers hadn&#039;t filed for a labor board election, instead demanding owner Ken Sturm deal with them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW blockades Street in front of Whole Foods Demanding Reinstatement for Worker</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-blockades-street-front-whole-foods-demanding-reinstatement-worker</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By DC Direct Action News - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/iww-blockades-street/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, January 14, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWWholeFoods4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Julia Flores is a 15 year employee of the P St Whole Foods who was fired from her job for organizing workers and informing them about such laws as the minimum wage. On the 13th of January, the IWW escalated the campaign demanding her job back by blocking the streets in front of another Whole Foods in Foggy Bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole Foods is trying to claim that Julia stole an item worth less than $10 after working there for 15 years. Nobody is believing this spurious claim, but this is how Whole Foods is attempting to stave off legal proceedings for violating labor laws. Firing workers for attempting to organize a union is illegal but a common practice, employers always make up some other reason for firing and dare workers to prove otherwise in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the legal proceedings, the IWW is holding Whole Foods accountable to the public with actions like the Jan 13 street blockade and picket that educate the public, drive away business, and create public relations problems with the surrounding neighborhood. There is a strong probability that Whole Foods will be hearing from other businesses in the area whose customers had trouble getting to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists from DC Stampede (an animal rights group) joined the IWW in this protest as a solidarity matter. Whole Foods has come to the attention of DC Stampede and Direct Action Everywhere (XDXE) in the past for ripping off their customers with meat alleged to be &amp;ldquo;cruelty-free&amp;rdquo; that was proven by a video to be from ordinary factory farms. Still earlier, the P st Whole Foods (the one that fired Juilia) played a role in the gentrification of Shaw. They were the first grocery store in that area to keep dumpsters locked up and use compactors. They absolutely refused to give a single scrap of discarded food to homeless service organizations in that time period (circa 2007). Finally. anarchists raided the P st Whole Foods during the October Rebellion (fall 2007 IMF protests), expropriated a large amount of food, and served it to the needy. In short, Whole Foods should be considered a repeat offender, a &amp;ldquo;frequent flier&amp;rdquo; for social justice campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What’s outrageous? Unpaid wages! Report from solidarity demo</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/what%E2%80%99s-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-solidarity-demo</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Communications Officer - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bristol IWW&lt;/a&gt;, November 14, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/DSCN1107-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Fellow Wobblies and supporters, Bristol Communications Officer here to report on the wet but very successful solidarity demo held this morning in Bristol outside Cafe Amore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We organised the demo in solidarity with Fellow Worker Bonny, who worked at Cafe Amore for a while and was not paid the full wages she was owed after quitting. Bristol IWW union representative assisted her in writing a demand letter to the cafe&amp;rsquo;s boss, which Bonny then delivered by hand a week ago accompanied by fellow Wobblies. During the week, the boss paid her some of the money she was owed but not all of it, and didn&amp;rsquo;t provide a clear explanation as to why he couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay the whole amount, and when he would do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, on we went this Saturday to hold a solidarity demo demanding the cafe&amp;rsquo;s boss to pay Bonny her wages, as well as to highlight the bad practices that Cafe Amore use on their staff &amp;ndash; unpaid trials, underpaying migrant staff, and forced unpaid overtime. &lt;/strong&gt;Despite the relentless rain, we had a very successful demonstration attended by around 30 people, with many members and supporters of the IWW, and members of Bristol SolNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Before the start of the demo, Bonny went in the cafe accompanied by her union rep and other members of the IWW to renew her demand and hand out flyers to customers. The boss was very aggressive towards them, making excuses as to why he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to pay Bonny&amp;rsquo;s full wages, and being very vague as to when he would pay her the remaining amount. He then went on to tell another IWW member who was trying to talk to customers to &amp;ldquo;get out of here or I&amp;rsquo;ll beat you up&amp;rdquo; in front of all the customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We stood outside the cafe for an hour, handing out flyers and singing songs in support of Bonny, and having lots of fun Wobbly-style! Lots of passers-by stopped to ask us what was going on and expressed interest and support for Bonny and what we were doing. But, Cafe Amore&amp;rsquo;s boss still hasn&amp;rsquo;t paid Bonny all the money she&amp;rsquo;s owed! Bristol IWW will carry on holding weekly solidarity demos outside Cafe Amore until Bonny&amp;rsquo;s paid up all the money she&amp;rsquo;s owed. &lt;strong&gt;Keep checking our blog and, especially, our Facebook page and Twitter feed (links on the right) and, if Bonny still doesn&amp;rsquo;t get paid, see you on Saturday 21 November at 12pm outside Cafe Amore&lt;/strong&gt; (which is on Nelson Street, next to Holland &amp;amp; Barrett). Or, as we put it today in our chants: Pay Bonny her money and we&amp;rsquo;ll go away / Pay Bonny her money or we&amp;rsquo;re here to stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you also work in the bar &amp;amp; hospitality sector &amp;ndash; bars, pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, catering, etc? Does any of this sound familiar to you? The IWW has just launched a campaign to support and organise workers in these businesses. You can read our statement here:&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/iww-bar-hospitality-workers-campaign/&quot;&gt; statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We have also written an article on local paper &amp;ldquo;The Bristol Cable&amp;rdquo; highlighting the issues of bar &amp;amp; hospitality workers in Bristol. You can read it here:&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://thebristolcable.org/2015/11/is-your-waiter-fair-trade-and-ethically-sourced/#&quot;&gt; article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Bonny&amp;rsquo;s situation sounds familiar to you, and you need help and support to stand up to bully bosses who don&amp;rsquo;t pay wages and treat their workers like doormats, email us at &lt;em&gt;bristol@iww.org.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We are a grassroots union that uses direct action methods to support workers to fight back for their rights. This is what we can offer you: training to know Employment Law and (where possible) use it to get what you want; training to represent your Fellow Workers in grievance and disciplinary meetings; training to organise your co-workers so you can speak as one voice, and get more influence over what goes on at work; and, finally, TRAINING TO WIN &amp;ndash; better terms and conditions, better pay, and less bullying from your boss!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Concrete examples of non labour relations board unions: Part III</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/concrete-examples-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-iii</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Phinneas Gage - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://recomposition.info/2015/11/06/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-iii/&quot;&gt;Recomposition&lt;/a&gt;, November 6, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/foodservwork_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;This is the third part of a series of concrete examples (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://recomposition.info/2015/08/27/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-i/&quot; class=&quot;bb-url&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://recomposition.info/2015/10/08/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-ii/&quot; class=&quot;bb-url&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt;) and very brief summaries of organizations that have some component of direct action and a form of collective bargaining that operate outside the labour relations framework. The following examples are from the IWWs organising efforts in food service. This includes fast food as well as grocery stores in a lot of the examples the IWW actually engaged in innovative organising that broke ground in more high profile campaigns like the well known &amp;ldquo;Fight for Fifteen&amp;rdquo; campaigns around raising the minimum wage in the USA. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;4. The IWW in Food Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;a). The Jimmy John&amp;rsquo;s Workers Union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jimmy John&amp;rsquo;s Workers Union started as an effort by the Twin Cities General Membership Branch of the IWW to organise in Fast Food. The campaign at it&amp;rsquo;s height had shop committees in multiple shops and a city wide committee. Ultimately, the campaign made a decision to go for an NLRB election and only failed by two votes with 85 in favour and 87 against. After that point the campaign went into steep decline but the organisers still managed to create an impressive track record of gains for themselves and their co-workers including: reversing decisions by management to fire people, addressing health and safety concerns for delivery drivers, tips jars, a city wide pay raise, and scheduling issues as well as countless smaller individual grievances in their shops. There is still an underground IWW presence in many shops across the USA and a very public campaign in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/span&gt;: Large numbers of workers mobilised. A city wide organisation spanning at all ten shops in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota) at its height. Coordination through city wide mass meetings. The media work on this campaign was impressive including making the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt;. Impressive gains before, during, and after the failed certification election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/span&gt;: Campaign wasn&amp;rsquo;t merely oriented towards a youth counter culture, it celebrated it and was itself a function of it. Substance abuse on the campaign was a major issue and led to key organisers putting their jobs at risk and getting injured unnecessarily. Logistically it was very lax with campaign data, mostly being kept in the personal notebooks of key organisers. Many organisers were also goal oriented to the point of certification becoming an all or nothing proposition and the campaign slowly contracted as key people moved on to other projects after the certification campaign failed, despite efforts to downplay the legal process by some organisers. As well the ability to join the JJWU campaign but not the IWW also created a tiered membership that made it ambiguous as to who was actually a member and difficult to consolidate membership beyond just the shop. Ultimately failed to bridge some of the demographic divides in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;What happened?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is still an underground IWW presence in some shops across the USA and a very public campaign in Baltimore. After the certification election six key organisers were fired over a publicity stunt involving a fight for sick days and the NLRB process is now on its last appeal several years later. The campaign is an impressive achievement for an all volunteer union on a shoe string budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;b). The Starbucks Workers Union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the Jimmy John&amp;rsquo;s Workers Union in the Twin Cities peaked at a failed certification election the Starbucks Workers Union really got going after a failed attempt at certification. In 2003 wobblies started organising at a Starbucks in Manhattan. In 2004 they tried for a union certification election. The National Labour Relations Board defined their bargaining unit as every Starbucks in Manhattan. which for an organising committee of only a handful became unfeasible as it would include hundreds of workers. So the campaign chose to continue outside of the recognition framework. Since that time over a decade ago the SWU has ran campaigns in dozens of cities going public in towns like New York, Chicago, Quebec, Minneapolis and Dallas. Countless underground committees have pushed back against management to rack up impressive wins like: changes to scheduling practices, enforcing the right to take bathroom breaks, winning a two dollar an hour raise for all Starbucks workers in New York, and improvements to health and safety. Perhaps their greatest achievement was winning Martin Luther King Day as a paid day off in the USA for all Starbucks workers, many of whom are African American. The union has also won countless small victories overturning discipline, fighting against sexual harassment and discrimination at work and extending international solidarity to Baristas in Chile. The union has made national press several times and has won several labour relations board rulings cementing some legal recourse to unions that exist outside the contract and certification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/span&gt;: Extremely fluid organisation allowed for rapid expansion to other cities and shops without too much red tape. The campaign can coordinate demands over multiple cities and countries. Strong emphasis on direct action, the campaign has repeatedly avoided certification elections since the initial defeat in New York and has since developed a strong practice of shop floor unionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/span&gt;: Like other IWW efforts in Fast Food the campaign suffers from a high turnover in their workforce and all the problems that come from that. The campaign was logistically lax at some points but fairly strong at others. Part of their very fluid structure made creating democratic structures and decision making difficult. The campaign also had a tendency to go public with a small minority in the shop. Part of this was due to a reliance, probably an over reliance, on media tactics. These strategic decisions put a tremendous amount of strain on key personalities and also create problems as far as giving credit to other people, creating an investment on the part of the less high profile activists, and bringing constant scrutiny and attention from management. Also when the Quebec wobblies joined the SWU from an already existing union formation things quickly fell apart due to differing emphases on direct action and a greater reliance on certification votes (which failed) in Canada. Ultimately the organisers quit en mass and called it direct action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;What happened?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The IWW still has organising activity at Starbucks stores all over North America and a public presence in New York that is going on twelve years this year.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Portland Restaurant Workers Win Back Wages</title>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 18, a group of workers from Yaw&amp;rsquo;s Top Notch Restaurant in Portland, Ore., took a stand. Leading the delegation into the restaurant, the group of 10 workers was accompanied by 30 community members from We Are Oregon and the IWW. To the shock of bosses and customers (and to the smiles of kitchen staff) a worker publicly read a letter addressed to the owners and management demanding over $1,200 in back wages that Yaw&#039;s has refused to pay. Less than a week later, with signed checks in hand, these same 10 individuals celebrated victory won through solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/portland-restaurant-workers-win-back-wages&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Demand An End to Worker Retaliation at Ellwood Thompson&#039;s!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/demand-end-worker-retaliation-ellwood-thompsons</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Richmond, Va - On behalf of Rain Burroughs, the Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and Food &amp;amp; Retail Workers United (FRWU) delivered a formal letter to Rick Hood (owner) and Tommy Langford (store manager) on December 21, 2012 requesting that Ellwood Thompson&#039;s Local Market reinstate Rain Burroughs immediately to an equivalent job with comparable pay, benefits, responsibilities, and hours of work. We have yet to receive any response, and we ask for your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain Burroughs was granted, via the federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), leave in order to assist her mother who was struggling with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Burroughs&#039; leave ended on November 20, 2012 when she returned to work at Ellwood Thompson&#039;s Local Market. Rather respect a loyal worker and honoring the commitment that had been made to them, Ellwood Thompson&#039;s chose to label Burroughs as a new hire and placed her on &#039;probation&#039;. This action by Ellwood Thompson&#039;s violates federal law which&lt;br /&gt;
