 <title>IWW Organizing Summit 2006</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2116</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/classic/clocksm1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&quot;By building organizations based on solidarity, rather than on
bureaucratic chain-of-command, we build organizations that by their very
existence help to bring a new kind of society into being.&quot;
--Staughton Lynd, &lt;i&gt;Solidarity Unionism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in recent memory wobblies from all over will be
meeting with the primary objective of discussing organizing. The
Organizing Summit is what many wobs have been wanting for years. It is a
chance to focus on organizing in the union and what it means to say,
&quot;Every member is an organizer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend will be hosted by the Austin GMB and was proposed at General
Assembly 2005 in the hopes of supporting the work of the Organizing
Department Formation Committee (ODFC). The assembly endorsed the Summit
and the ODFC has also endorsed the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2116&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
