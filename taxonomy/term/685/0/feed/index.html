BUTTE - With an old, worn broom, Dennis Georg swept off nearly a foot
of February snow that had accumulated on the grave of Frank Little.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was just a small favor from one Wobbly to another Wobbly: Solidarity to the end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Georg,
as was Little, is a card-carrying member of a small but controversial
union known as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). It was
started in Chicago by a group of socialists and anarchists who wanted
to unite all the workers of the world. They were reviled by many as
subversives and Communists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It was once very dangerous to carry an IWW card,&amp;quot; Georg said recently while in Butte.
