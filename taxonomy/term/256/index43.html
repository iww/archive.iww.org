</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/21/2010 - 3:21pm</p>
<p><b>Marie Mason Transferred to a new prison in Carswell, Texas.
By Kenneth Miller and Erik Davis - {based on original story by FW Miller for the <i>Defiant Spirit</i>}</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../sites/default/files/marie_fciwaseca.jpg" height=360 width=259 align="right" />Fellow Worker Marie Mason, a long-time member of the Industrial Workers of the World, is currently serving a 22-year sentence for two acts property destruction in 1999 and 2000, events in which no injuries were intended, and in which none occurred.</p>
<p>Marie has received the longest sentence of any of the Green Scare defendants, whose prosecution in America appears to be the new front line in the revived COINTELPRO-esque actions of the state. While there is room in our union for discussion and disapproval of the acts that resulted in Marie's imprisonment, the more significant issues before us are the use of Green Scare prosecutions to pioneer a new set of repressive laws and punishments for those who oppose the state in general, and capitalism and its depredations in particular.</p>
<p>The Twin Cities GMB of the IWW voted to 'adopt' FW Mason when she was transferred to a Federal facility in Minnesota, in Waseca, about an hour and a half from the Twin Cities. I was able to make a few visits during her period here, and exchanged many letters. I found her to be an astonishing person, full of optimism and struggle, even in her dire circumstances. She taught guitar and music lessons, and organized with the self-named group of "Spanish Mommies" (Spanish-language speaking imprisoned mothers). Her personal struggles were not her focus, although they were considerable. As a vegan and a practicing Buddhist, she was never permitted a proper diet or the ability to properly practice her faith.</p>
<p>Marie has now been transferred to a new federal facility in Carswell, Texas, near our sisters and brothers in Fort Worth. Marie was held in a Solitary Housing Unit for a considerable amount of time both prior to the transfer and after. While she is now out of solitary, her unit has only 16 others, and they are never permitted to leave the building in which they are housed (i.e., no time outside at all). It is unclear whether her dietary or religious needs are being properly addressed.</p>
<p>At this time, FW Marie needs our actions, and our solidarity. You can help out significantly merely by writing to her; the address is below. Please DO NOT SEND MONEY, as she will be fined for this and the money confiscated. We also hope that fellow workers in Fort Worth and the Carswell area will consider formally 'adopting' her the way the Twin Cities branch did, and make attempts to visit her.</p>
<p>Write her at MARIE MASON #04672-061, FMC CARSWELL, FEDERAL MEDICAL CENTER, P.O. BOX 27137, FORT WORTH, TX 76127 She is being represented by a lawyer at the Civil Liberties Defense Fund in Eugene, Oregon. Contact Kenneth Miller at 412-867-9213 if you are in the Carswell/Fort Worth area.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/14/2010 - 3:19pm</p>
<p>The Richmond Industrial Workers of the World have been working closely with the Richmond Transit Riders Union since its formation in June 2010. Together we have written and delivered this open letter to key city officials. </p>
<p>Dear Mayor Dwight C. Jones, Council Persons and CEO John M. Lewis Jr.,</p>
<p> The Richmond Transit Riders Union understands that it was determined during the July 26, 2010 City Council Meeting, that a need for an expedited increase in fares was able to be deferred until September 19th due to a 3 percent increase in ridership over the previous three months.</p>
<p> However, John Lewis stated in a July 27th Richmond Times Dispatch article, “If that trend continues, we’ll be more than able to absorb that $190,000″ in lost revenue.</p>
<p> If there has been an increase in ridership, and that increase has allowed GRTC to be “more than able to absorb” lost revenue, why should riders still expect to pay an increase in fares?</p>
<p> We ask to place a freeze on the scheduled fare increase, and wait another quarter to determine whether the revenue from the fare box is sufficient.</p>

<a href="../../../node/5178/" rel="bookmark">On Labor Day, Jimmy John&#039;s Faces Coast to Coast Actions in Support of Nation&#039;s First-Ever Fast Food Union</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/08/2010 - 1:53pm</p>
<p><b>Momentum Builds as Workers Seek Relief for Mounting Economic Frustration - <a href="http://jimmyjohnsworkers.org/" target="_blank">jimmyjohnsworkers.org</a></b></p>
<p><img src="../../../graphics/IU640/jjworkers1sm.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS- From Clovis, California to Miami, Florida, Jimmy John's was besieged coast to coast on Labor Day by leafleting and pickets in support of the first-ever unionization effort at the national sandwich chain. The emergent IWW Jimmy Johns Workers Union is coordinating a National Week of Action against the company to reach out to workers and pressure Minneapolis franchise owners to meet with their employees, who moved to unionize on Thursday. Over the course of the week, actions are planned in 32 of 39 states in which the company operates.</p>
<p>“Working conditions are terrible- poverty wages, being forced to work while sick, inconsistent hours, management favoritism, the list goes on. We formed a union to fight for change, starting at Jimmy Johns today, and throughout the entire fast food industry tomorrow. These nationally-coordinated actions have shown company owner Jimmy John Liautaud that if he doesn't clean up his act, we'll take a bite out of his business,” said David Boehnke, a union member at Jimmy Johns.</p>
<p>The national corporate headquarters of Jimmy Johns has yet to respond to the unionization campaign, the first at the expanding sandwich empire. The union effort could have profound implications for other employers in the fast food industry, a sector known for the lowest rate of unionization– and lowest wages– in the United Sates. Only 1.8% of food service workers were represented by a union in 2009, far below the nation-wide figure of 12.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>The fast food workers' move to unionize is emblematic of mounting frustration amongst US workers with the sluggish pace of recovery from the Recession. With unemployment rates hovering around 9.5%, many workers view low wage service jobs as their only option. Employment in the food service industry is expected to grow 8.4% from 2008 to 2018, higher than the 7.7% rate predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for all industries. Wages and working conditions in the fast food industry are widely regarded as substandard; in 2009, about 17% of food workers earned at or below $5.15 an hour after taxes, the highest percentage of any occupational group.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/07/2010 - 4:12pm</p>
IWW members met in St. Paul, Minnesota this past weekend for the annual IWW General Convention. Wobblies from the US, Canada, the UK, and Germany gathered to discuss union business, vote on constitutional amendments and resolutions, and of course to meet and get to know one another! The convention took place at Macalester College.
<BR /><BR />
In addition to attending the convention, wobblies participated in a picket outside one of the Twin Cities' nine Jimmy John's locations on Saturday.
