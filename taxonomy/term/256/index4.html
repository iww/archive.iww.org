<a href="../../../content/can-%e2%80%9csolidarity-unionism%e2%80%9d-save-labor-movement/" rel="bookmark">Can “solidarity unionism” save the labor movement?</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 11/08/2015 - 2:56pm</p>
<p><strong>By Eric Dirnbach - <a href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/can-solidarity-unionism-save-labor-movement/" target="_blank">Waging Nonviolence</a>, November 4, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="510" align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/SolidarityUnionismCoverLrg.jpg" alt="" />The debate on how to revive the troubled U.S. labor movement has been around for decades. Labor activists generally believe that much greater rank-and-file democracy and workplace militancy is the key to labor renewal. However, an essential perspective that is usually missing from the conversation is well represented by Staughton Lynd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism: Rebuilding the Labor Movement from Below,&rdquo; which was first published in 1992 and has been recently reissued.</p>
<p>Lynd is a legendary progressive lawyer and activist from Youngstown, Ohio. He is the coauthor with his wife Alice Lynd of the classic &ldquo;Rank and File: Personal Histories by Working-Class Organizers,&rdquo; a collection of oral histories of militant union organizers, which informs much of the framework of &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism.&rdquo; At around 100 pages, the book reads more like a summary of his organizing philosophy, and many readers will come away wanting a more extensive discussion. It should be read along with several other recent books which make similar arguments: Stanley Aronowitz&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2015/02/review-can-labor-save-itself" target="_blank">The Death and Life of American Labor: Toward a New Workers&rsquo; Movement</a>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2014/10/review-alt-labor-or-not-it-will-take-rank-and-file-power-revive-us" target="_blank">New Forms of Worker Organization: The Syndicalist and Autonomist Restoration of Class-Struggle Unionism</a>,&rdquo; edited by Immanuel Ness, who also provided the introduction for &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynd argues for a rethinking of the assumptions of the labor movement and for a revived version of labor organizing that was more prominent in the pre-New Deal era that he calls &ldquo;solidarity unionism.&rdquo; What may surprise most labor-oriented readers is that central to this kind of unionism is the absence of a contract between the union and the employer.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the whole point of forming a union to get a written collective bargaining agreement? Lynd doesn&rsquo;t think so and he argues that workers fighting together with direct action on the job to make improvements in the workplace do not need a contract and may be hurt by having one. He is critical of the &ldquo;management rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;no-strike&rdquo; clauses that are standard in almost all union contracts. He believes they reduce the power of workers to influence major decisions in how the workplace is run and to solve their problems at work immediately as they arise. Contracts tend to remove agency from the workers and place it in the hands of union staff who typically bargain and process grievances while the members may be uninvolved and cynical. Lynd is also skeptical of a union&rsquo;s exclusive representation of all workers in the workplace and automatic dues check-off, preferring for workers to actively join the union and pay dues because they want to.</p>
<p>Lynd&rsquo;s view of the prevailing &ldquo;contract unionism&rdquo; differs from standard labor history, which considers the 1935 <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a>, or NLRA, labor reforms as a progressive advance for workers. In the mainstream view, workers organizing, with the support of President Roosevelt, finally won full government enforcement for the right to organize and bargain collectively. In exercising this right, unions typically hold workplace elections and then negotiate contracts with employers that set the conditions of employment and also guarantee labor peace (no strike/no lockout) for the term of the contract. This industrial relations framework led the way for millions of workers to organize and improve their wages and working conditions. This &ldquo;class compromise&rdquo; held for several decades until employers changed their mind and increased their opposition to unionization again.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/07/2015 - 1:55pm</p>
<p><strong>By Joe Allen - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/amazon-fedex-ups-post-office-teamsters/"><em>Jacobin</em></a>, November 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="244" height="320" align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/Fish.jpg" alt="" />It took the United Parcel Service one hundred and eight years to get to its current position in the world today, less than half that time for Walmart, DHL, and FedEx, and just over two decades for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/amazon-google-facebook-privacy-bezos/">Amazon</a>. The speed of transformation in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/logistics-industry-organizing-labor/">global logistics industry</a> is rapidly increasing, spurred on by Amazon&rsquo;s current building spree across North America and Europe.</p>
<p>For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-logistics-facilities-update-2015-10?utm_source=googleplaynewsstand&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">according to&nbsp;<em>Business Insider</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon has added 21 new logistics facilities globally over the last 12 months, up 14% from last year, bringing the total to 173 facilities worldwide. Of the 173 facilities, 104 are in the North America region, with the rest spread across Europe and Asia. The 173 logistics facilities include the large fulfillment-center warehouse; sortation centers, where packages get presorted for shipping; and Prime Now hub, a separate building to store one-hour delivery items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly big things are afoot. Amazon&rsquo;s recent job listing strongly suggests it is building a senior staff for a major logistics and transportation department that includes a&nbsp;&ldquo;Senior Program Manager &mdash; Last Mile Transportation SME,&rdquo; &ldquo;Driver Experience Manager,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Network Manager &mdash; Amazon Logistics Freight.&rdquo; A former Amazon engineer told&nbsp;<em>Business Insider</em>, &ldquo;If Amazon can stop paying FedEx and start controlling their own destiny in terms of the costs of fulfillment and shipping and transportation, it increases their profit margin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another sign of the rapidly transforming logistics industry is&nbsp;UPS&rsquo;s recent purchase of the Chicago-based Coyote Logistics for $1.8 billion. Coyote is a new model of freight forwarding; it has no vehicles or warehouses of its own, and instead provides logistics for 12,000 shippers with a network of 35,000 local, regional, and national carriers.</p>
<p>A decade earlier UPS made its largest acquisition up to that point when it bought Overnite Transportation, a huge non-union freight company. UPS&rsquo;s purchase of Overnite was a major move into the traditional freight business, and followed FedEx&rsquo;s acquisition&nbsp;of several regional freight companies and creation of FedEx Freight.</p>
<p>FedEx is also trying to keep up with the competitive pressures from Amazon and UPS. Earlier this year it acquired the Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express for $4.8 billion &mdash; giving it access to TNT&rsquo;s Europe-wide road network to compete with UPS and DHL &mdash; and FedEx Ground has announced plans to build large facilities in <a target="_blank" href="http://postandparcel.info/66543/news/fedex-aiming-to-build-new-distribution-hub-in-connecticut/" target="_blank">Middleton, CT</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flgov.com/2014/12/30/governor-scott-announces-fedex-ground-building-new-distribution-hub-in-ocala/" target="_blank">Ocala, FL</a>; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2015/03/17/fedex-to-start-50-million-hamburg-project.html" target="_blank">Hamburg, NY</a>.</p>
<p>DHL &mdash; formally DHL Express, a division of Deutsche Post &mdash; is also reinvesting substantially in its US operations, including a $108 million upgrade to its Cincinnati air hub that processes about 46 million international shipments each year. Though it is smaller than UPS&rsquo;s nearby Worldport or FedEx&rsquo;s Superhub, DHL&rsquo;s Cincinnati operations primarily focus on international shipments from Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If DHL is making investments in infrastructure expansion in Cincinnati, that means they&rsquo;re very confident that they&rsquo;re going to continue to grow their intercontinental network,&rdquo; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dhl-to-spend-108-million-to-expand-cincinnati-air-hub-1433101099" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;Brian Clancy, a managing director with Logistics Capital &amp; Strategy, a Virginia-based transportation consulting firm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DHL Global Forwarding signed an agreement with a Kazakhstan-based express company to speed the transit of rail-based freight across the Eurasian continent as an alternative to traditional sea and airfreight. In addition, it announced plans to establish its own parcel network in Austria by 2016 and to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dpdhl.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2015/dhl_invests_47_million_africa.html" target="_blank">invest</a> &euro;47 million in sub-Saharan Africa as part of an effort to derive&nbsp;30 percent of its revenue from&nbsp;emerging markets by 2020.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the scramble, the United States Postal Service (USPS), the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/usps-bronx-privatization-murals-new-deal-art/">venerable</a>, much-derided, and constitutionally mandated mail&nbsp;carrier, has emerged as a major player in the logistics industry.</p>
<p>This summer,&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-30/it-s-amazon-s-world-the-usps-just-delivers-in-it" target="_blank">called</a> the USPS &ldquo;an extension of Amazon&rdquo; and noted that &ldquo;Amazon receives a deep discount from the post office because the e-tailer does so much of its own processing &mdash; including providing computerized address lists to make it easier for carriers to tailor their delivery routes for faster drop-offs.&rdquo; A 2014 estimate by Bernstein Research, which tracks the shipping industry, put the USPS&rsquo;s shipments and deliveries at 40&nbsp;percent of Amazon&rsquo;s volume, or almost 150 million items (UPS accounted for&nbsp;20&ndash;25 percent and FedEx 15&ndash;20 percent).</p>
<p>While UPS, FedEx, DHL, and the USPS are fierce competitors, many people would be surprised by the cooperation between the logistics giants. Both FedEx and UPS have discounted residential package delivery services with the USPS called, respectively,&nbsp;SmartPost and SurePost. And the volume is enormous. Last year, the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-mail-does-the-trick-for-fedex-ups-1407182247" target="_blank">reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For FedEx alone, the post office delivers an average of 2.2 million packages a day, or about 30% of the express-mail company&rsquo;s total U.S. ground segment. UPS won&rsquo;t specify how many&nbsp;of its shipments go through the post office, but a regulatory filing indicates those types of lightweight shipments accounted for 40% &mdash; or about 37 million packages &mdash; of its total increase in ground shipments in 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both SmartPost and SurePost services are designed to deal with the unwanted costs of the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; &mdash; the industry term for the final step in the delivery process, handing over the package to the recipient. FedEx or UPS may have every address in the United States in their databases, but neither wants to go to every address every day, and they certainly don&rsquo;t want to make a second attempt if the recipient isn&rsquo;t home the first time around. The USPS, on the other hand, has to go to each&nbsp;address daily&nbsp;to delivery first-class mail.</p>
<p>Ultimately, UPS and FedEx want to snatch up&nbsp;the most profitable areas and dump the rest. For example, FedEx <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-23/fedex-to-fly-mail-for-postal-service-for-10-5-billion" target="_blank">beat out</a> UPS in 2013 for a seven-year, $10.5 billion contract with the USPS to fly its mail between US airports.</p>
<p>The rising volume of packages has transformed the USPS,&nbsp;necessitating&nbsp;major capital&nbsp;investment. In 2013, the post office spent $200 million to furnish its delivery vehicles with handheld scanners to provide real-time package tracking. And its plan to replace its fleet of 163,000 delivery trucks, which were not designed to hold packages, could cost as much as $4.5 billion.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 10/24/2015 - 9:48pm</p>
<p><b>By the Admin Staff - <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/10/08/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-ii/">Recomposition</a>, October 8, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s. </em></p>
<p><i><i><img width="320" height="321" align="right" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/SSWU1.jpg" />This is the second&nbsp;part of a <a href="http://recomposition.info/2015/08/27/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-i/">series of concrete examples</a> and very brief summaries of organizations that have some component of direct action and a form of collective bargaining that operate outside the&nbsp;<span class="il">labour</span> <span class="il">relations</span> framework. </i>The&nbsp;following are&nbsp;IWW projects that had aspects of Labour Relations Board campaigns to them but were essentially not oriented towards the LRB. You will also notice that these examples are American. One key difference in the American context is the presence of a longer and richer history of what is called &ldquo;minority unionism&rdquo; that is unions that seek to build majorities from minorities but are capable of acting as a part of the workforce that doesn&rsquo;t always represent a majority pro-union group as verified by card check or a board election.</i></p>
<h3><b>2. Corridor Campaigns:&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><b>a). Montpelier Downtown Workers Union</b><br />
Corridor campaigns were a popular model for IWW branches to experiment with in the early to mid 2000&rsquo;s.&nbsp;This campaign started as a corridor campaign under the United Electrical Workers Union. An independent union with a history of Communist leadership. They were based on having small committees in small shops spread out over a geographic area with a similar constellation of businesses, usually retail corridors.</p>
<p>This campaign started under the sponsorship of a workers centre run by the UE and ran for a few years. One of the more innovative elements of this campaign was the grievance committee combined with stewards that were assigned to a geographic area. Non members were told of the presence of a stewards in their area and if they had problems to go the member of the MDWU who would help them resolve problems. They also had a grievance committee that would pool resources to tackle bigger tougher problems.</p>
<p>Eventually the UE tried to push it to sign more contracts, as the campaign was failing they signed on with the IWW but it continued it&rsquo;s decline and folded.</p>
<p>Advantages: Multiple committees in multiple shops. Geographic stewards, grievance committee. Had a clear way to address smaller concerns that didn&rsquo;t warrant mass industrial action but weren&rsquo;t simply individual gripes either.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Pressure from business union sponsor to go for contracts. Small shops prone to high turnover, going public in small shops allows the boss to charm neutrals and organise anti union elements easily.</p>
<p><b>b). South Street Workers Union</b><br />
South Street was a campaign in a retail corridor in Philadelphia started by the IWW branch there. It had multiple committees in multiple small shops. They agitated around workplace issues as well as workers issues off the job including a campaign around transit fares. The campaign lasted a number of years and built up the branch but eventually folded.</p>
<p>Advantages: Maintained a function organisation between small multiple shops over a few years. Agitated around issues in the community and mobilised the community around non workplace demands as well as making some small gains in shops.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: High turnover wore the campaign down.</p>
<h3><b>3. The IWW and Bike Couriers:</b></h3>
<p>There is very little documentation that is easy to track down and I have a few articles I intend to put online but the Bike Courier campaigns of the early 2000s had a tremendous influence on the development of Direct Unionism or Solidarity Unionism. The key organisers in these campaigns had a huge impact on the IWW and played a central role in the transition from being mostly a radical labour history club to a small fighting union with a different program from the rest of the labour movement. The longest running and most high profile campaign was in Chicago where the IWW maintained a presence in the courier industry for ten years. They had committees spanning multiple shops and won grievances against employers as well as mounting campaigns against building management companies to make their buildings more accessible to the couriers that served their tenants.</p>
<p>There were also bike courier committees in Portland, New York, Boston and San Francisco to name a few others.</p>
<p>Advantages: Extremely flexible organisations, took on issues on and off the job. Well developed conception of non contractual unionism. Multiple campaigns in multiple shops in Chicago. Also very structured and formal in Portland and Chicago, clear meeting agendas, rules of order and elected officers.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Never broke out of the bike courier sub culture in a meaningful way. Very oriented towards a largely young and urban counter culture workforce.</p>

<a href="../../../content/iww-turkey-and-greece-common-statement-about-latest-ankara-massacre/" rel="bookmark">IWW Turkey and Greece common statement about the latest Ankara massacre</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 10/16/2015 - 11:57pm</p>
<p>The bombing on 10th of October 2015 was directly against the Kurdish liberation movement, the working class and all oppositions who resist against the dictatorship.</p>
<p>This massacre is another ring of the chain that extends from Armenian genocide to Dersim massacre, from May Day&rsquo;77 to Maraş Massacre&rsquo;78, from Şırnak Massacre&rsquo;92 to Diyarbakır and Suru&ccedil; bombings that happened within this year. All these massacres have targeted the people who ask for Freedom, Democracy and Justice on Anatolia over the last 100 years. The offender side has always been fascist party militants, religious fundamentalists and occasionally governmental commissioners themselves.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
