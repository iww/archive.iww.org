This action is part of the movement against austerity measures and in our campaign for a social strike on May 1, 2015.</p>
<p>Today, many workers are directly confronted with the effects of budget cuts to health services, to municipal employees, to firemen and firewomen, to postal workers, to students, to workers in the private sector... Yet, resistance is organizing itself everywhere. We will not let different governments (whether conservative or liberal) and the bosses impose their anti-social measures on us. The time of a minority enriching itself on the back of an impoverished majority is finished.against austerity measures and in our campaign for a social strike on May 1, 2015.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p>I was stunned and flattered when Nicki Meier asked me to profile my old friend and Fellow Worker Penny Pixler for this special Women&rsquo;s Issue of the Industrial Worker. I was a bit intimidated too. I haven&rsquo;t been asked to contribute to the paper I once helped edit for over three decades, and I fretted how some might respond to a man profiling one of the leading Wobbly women of the last 40 some odd years. Mostly I fretted about how to paint a human portrait that transcended biography or a hagiographic obituary. I started and stopped half a dozen times.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
