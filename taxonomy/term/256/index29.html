<p>On the weekend of Nov. 16-17, the Boston IWW held two separate actions in Harvard Square to protest the Cambridge Police&rsquo;s Nov. 14th attack on our legal picket at Insomnia Cookies, where the union is conducting an organizing drive. Cambridge cops swarmed our picket, assaulted and then arrested a Wobbly &mdash; supposedly for assaulting them! Our Fellow Worker was punched, thrown on a car trunk and then the ground, and pinned partially under a car before being dragged away. This was a totally unprovoked attack on a legal picket on a public sidewalk. IWW members and allies protested in Harvard Square on Friday Nov. 15, and returned on Saturday, Nov. 16, making the streets of Cambridge ring with our chants (&ldquo;Cambridge PD / Stop the brutality!&rdquo;), and letting community members know what local cops have been doing to suppress labor rights, civil liberties and free speech.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

From <a href="http://starbucksunion.org/">StarbucksUnion.org</a></p>
<p>Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz likes to play the good guy. He asked us to &quot;come together&quot; to pressure Washington to make a budget deal, raise the debt ceiling, and end the government shutdown. But when it comes to his own workers, its a different story. Across the world, Starbucks pays its 100% part-time barista workforce poverty wages, and busts unions when workers &quot;come together&quot; for change, even while raking in over $1.7 billion in profits this year. Right now, Starbucks baristas are on strike in Chile, where they make less per hour than the price of a cup of coffee.</p>

<a href="../../../content/how-we-struggle-response-ongoing-patriarchal-violence-iww/" rel="bookmark">How We Struggle: A Response to Ongoing Patriarchal Violence in the IWW</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 10/29/2013 - 7:05pm</p>
<p><b>By the Patriarchy Resistance Committee of the Portland GMB - October 9th, 2013</b></p>
<p>To our Fellow Workers:</p>
<p><img src="../../../sites/default/files/images/x351964-4.jpg" align="right" />The Patriarchy Resistance Committee (PRC) of the Portland GMB has recently been notified of multiple instances of misogyny and sexual assault that have occurred within branches of the IWW. We write today to condemn these acts of violence and to encourage FWs around the world to actively resist misogynist and patriarchal behavior in all of its forms.</p>
<p>A member of the Kansas City branch was recently accused of being a serial rapist. In order to secure the immediate personal safety of the rest of the branch, he was asked by a coalition of Kansas City Wobblies to resign. The PRC supports the members of the Kansas City GMB who have prioritized the participation of all workers over that of a potentially violent man.</p>
<p>Time and time again, we see people (specifically and disproportionately women and people who do not identify with the gender binary) leave our organizing projects in response to physical, emotional and/or symbolic manifestations of gendered or sexual violence in our circles.</p>
<p>In the essay <a href="https://necessarymeansfight.blogspot.com/2013/02/on-solidarity-and-sexual-violence-open.html" target="_blank">On Solidarity and Sexual Violence: An open letter to the Palestine Solidarity Movement</a> Cassandra Solanas states:</p>
<blockquote>Often targets of patriarchy don’t want to be a victim twice; once from the original incident and again for having comrades betray them by not listening, not taking them seriously, and not acting.</blockquote>
<p>We wonder why, in radical circles and in our own union, are so many willing to fight against bosses who disempower the working class, but choose to ignore, or worse, actively defend individuals whose patriarchal behaviors systematically disempower survivors. The IWW is built around the principles of direct action in the struggle against capitalism. We empower workers within the shop to determine the organizing tactics that will be most effective while keeping the workers safe from the bosses.</p>
<p>We would like to start a discussion on how these principles may also be useful in addressing gendered and sexual violence within our union.
The charges process described in the IWW’s constitution (see article III of the bylaws) can be a useful tool for some situations. Similarly, some survivors have found accountability processes to be helpful. However, both systems have serious flaws and can bring negative repercussions to both individuals and communities including: retraumatization, alienation, and lack of transparency, justice, and survivor-focused approaches.</p>
<p>Consider the following analogy: The IWW does not rely on the law for the protection of workers, recognizing that those who have the power to design and enforce the law do not share the interest of workers. IWW organizers are often told by capitalist sympathizers that we should just engage the legal system, that the system is fair and democratic. Our experience has proven otherwise. Similarly, some individuals may find it hard to trust a charges process when those who are in control of the process often do not experience the dynamics of our oppressions. We also are reassured that the system is fair and democratic, but our experience proves otherwise. This is demonstrated by the growing number of Fellow Workers who continue to leave the union due to a lack of organizational support.</p>

The IWW International Solidarity Commission stands with Starbucks workers in Chile, members of the independent Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile in their struggle for a voice on the job. Starbucks has refused to negotiate with their union in good faith, instead breaking the law to crush the union and stifle workers' voices. This will not stand. The globalization of capitalism, often symbolized by Starbucks itself, requires the globalization of workers' organizations to advance the class struggle. The Industrial Workers of the World took action in support of our Chilean Fellow Workers' strike in 2011, and will take action again to assert global worker solidarity against corporate autocracy. An injury to one is an injury to all!</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
