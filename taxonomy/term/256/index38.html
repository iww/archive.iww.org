<p><strong>By Julie Jargon - <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, July 6, 2011</strong></p>
<p>In what would be Starbucks Corp.'s first strike at a company-owned store, baristas at the chain's outlets in Chile plan to walk out Thursday because, they say, their wages are so low that they can't afford to buy lunch.</p>
<p>Unionized employees at 30 of Starbucks's 31 Chilean stores plan to walk out for as many as several days, said Andr?s Giordano, president of the union, Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile.</p>
<p>Mr. Giordano, a 24-year-old shift supervisor in Santiago, said the starting hourly wage for Chilean Starbucks workers is the equivalent of $2.50, and it hasn't changed in eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;Lunch in Chile costs $5 to $6,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Chilean workers have been pressing for a lunch stipend since they organized two years ago. Starbucks managers in Chile get a monthly &quot;lunch bonus&quot; of $50, while other employees are offered two free coffees a day. &quot;I would prefer to eat a sandwich,&quot; Mr. Giordano said.</p>
<p>The skirmish underscores one of the challenges U.S.-based companies like Starbucks face as they expand their global footprint. Multinational companies seeking to enter new markets often have to deal with local labor groups and government requirements to honor collective bargaining.</p>
<p>As a condition of merging with African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently agreed to honor union-bargaining agreements for three years.</p>
<p>Starbucks has had to comply with government-mandated participation in collective-bargaining agreements in Brazil and Argentina. The company has also clashed with workers who tried unsuccessfully to organize in Europe and New Zealand, and it has battled with unionized workers in North America, where 300 employees are members of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 06/19/2011 - 1:16pm</p>
<p><img vspace="3" hspace="3" align="right" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/jurisdictional_picket1.preview.jpg" width="320" height="287" />The news website Gawker.com recently released for public viewing a copy of Target's antiunion propaganda video. Filled with scary tales of those terrifying union organizers and how they're out for your money, it was a typically low-budget production and we frankly give it two thumbs down.</p>
<p>What we do take incredible exception to is that this anti-union propaganda video was a union job,starring two members of AFTRA, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Ric Reitz and Nicky Buggs.<br />
<br />
We find it simply abhorent that anyone at all would, under the jurisdiction of their union, portray such capitalist, anti-worker swill and be fine collecting a paycheck. Ric Reitz offered an explanation typical of that drilled into too many workers by the pro-boss business unions under the AFL-CIO: &quot;If someone hires me to play a rapist, does it make me a rapist?</p>
<p>You take the job, and you're an actor,&quot; says Reitz, a longtime member of AFTRA and the Screen Actors Guild. &quot;Am I pro-union? Absolutely.&quot; To which we ask, &quot;Would you take a job playing a rapist in a video intended to promote rape?&quot;</p>

<p>The decline of unions does not mean the end of the labor movement. Indeed, the last few years have seen a proliferation of new kinds of worker organizations and workers' rights campaigns. Some of the most exciting of late have been conducted by community-based groups (rather than workplace-based unions), such as the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and those part of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.pmpress.org/content/article.php/20080722202202555"><em>Solidarity Unionism at Starbucks</em></a>, a recent pamphlet published by PM Press, Daniel Gross and Staughton Lynd highlight an increasingly important feature of today&rsquo;s labor movement&mdash;nonunion workers using direct action strategies protected by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)&mdash;while examining the <a href="../../../">Industrial Workers of the World</a>&rsquo;s (IWW)'s ongoing efforts to organize Starbucks.</p>
