<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 10/08/2015 - 3:11pm</p>
<p><strong>By Kevin Rashid Johnson - <a href="../p%3d1251/" target="_blank">Kevin Rashid Johnson</a>, June 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/GDc.jpg" alt="" />I have, as an active leading member of the New Afrikan Black Panther Party &ndash; Prison Chapter (NABPP-PC), recently joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) upon its founding the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC).<sup><a title="Article II, sec. 1.c. of the IWW Constitution permits membership to unpaid officers of political parties." class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_0_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_0_1251">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The IWOC&rsquo;s stated purpose is to &ldquo;function [ ] as a liaison for prisoners to organize each other, unionize, and build solid bridges between prisoners on the inside and fellow workers on the outside.&rdquo;<sup><a title="The Incarcerated Worker, Vol. 1, No. 1, January 2015, p.1" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_1_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_1_1251">2</a></sup>&nbsp; To this end the IWW has recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners are on the front lines of wage slavery and forced slave labor where refusal to work while in prison results in inhumane retaliation and participation in slave labor contributes to the mechanisms of exploitation. The [IWW] has consciously grasped the importance of organizing prisoners so that prisoners can directly challenge prison slavery, work conditions, and the system itself: break cycles of criminalization, exploitation, and the state sponsored divisions of our working class.&nbsp; At the same time, the prison environment and culture is a melting pot of capitalistic and exploitative tactics and all forms of oppression.&nbsp; These poisons must be challenged in prisons, institutions, and in all of us, through organized working class solidarity.&rdquo;<sup><a title="Ibid." class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_2_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_2_1251">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NABPP-PC has unity with this line and purpose, and allies with the IWW to these and broader ends.&nbsp; Indeed we have for years advanced the idea of extending union membership to prisoners.<sup><a title="See, Kevin &ldquo;Rashid&rdquo; Johnson, Promoting Proletarian Consciousness as Prisoner Rehabilitation (2007), http://rashidmod.com/?p=374" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_3_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_3_1251">4</a></sup> So the IWOC&rsquo;s founding is right on time!</p>
<p>The NABPP-PC is not a traditional communist party, but rather a pre-party formation that advances the cause of revolutionary intercommunalism, and whose target base is the oppressed urban masses and prisoners (the lumpen and unemployed in particular<sup><a title="For an analysis of our line on the lumpen and the proletariat as our mass base, see, Kevin &ldquo;Rashid&rdquo; Johnson, The NABPP-PC: Our Line (2005), http://rashidmod.com/?p=286" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_4_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_4_1251">5</a></sup> ) of all nationalities, &ldquo;races,&rdquo; etc., but especially New Afrikans/Blacks.&nbsp; Within the NABPP-PC we have the White Panther Organization (WPO) and Brown Panther Organizing Committee (BPOC), which operate as arms of the NABPP-PC to bring our line and strategy to all other oppressed peoples.</p>
<p>The NABPP-PC is guided by the ideological and political line of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM).&nbsp; We unite in camaraderie with all whom we can to oppose the oppressive capitalist imperialist system, racism and repression, whether they share our line or not.</p>
<p>Various strata of the working class in Amerika have been spontaneously rising in protest against unsatisfactory work conditions and wages.&nbsp; From those in the lower service trades, to teachers, to public sector workers.&nbsp; Many have been oriented to more radical politics than mere trade unionism which only aspires to workplace and wage reforms.&nbsp; This was evidenced in the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in September 2011 and quickly spread across Amerika.&nbsp; Various &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; sectors have been reaching for political lines that address greater social ills like capitalist driven environmental crisis, imperialist wars, the proliferation of &ldquo;terroristic&rsquo; violence especially in regions of the world destabilized by the policies and actions of the US and its allies, police violence, sexism, prevailing racism, mass imprisonment, etc. Only a thoroughgoing revolutionary political line can connect clear analyses and solutions with these questions.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/30/2015 - 9:04pm</p>
<p><b>By </b><b>Immanuel Ness - <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/21/us-labor-law-at-80-the-enduring-relevance-of-class-struggle-unionism/" target="_blank"><em>CounterPunch</em></a>, September 22, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/clock.jpg" />By embracing collective bargaining through the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, or Wagner Act, organized labor deprived workers of their capacity to contest private and state power. This compromise closed out any possibility of building a mass-based labor movement for decades. Rather than advancing the interests of workers, the NLRA circumscribed workers&rsquo; aspirations for democratic syndicalist and autonomist unions.</p>
<h3><strong>IWW: Alternative to Contract Unionism</strong></h3>
<p>In examining the long-term failure of organized labor, we must first note the alternative, organic, autonomous workers&rsquo; movement embodied in particular by unions affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. From its inception in 1905 until the 1920&rsquo;s, the IWW represented a significant alternative to contract unionism. The IWW stood for the solidarity of <em>all</em> workers and it was fiercely opposed for that reason &mdash; by capital, by reformists such as Daniel DeLeon of the Socialist Labor Party and by the American Federation of Labor (AFL).<a name="_ednref1"><sup><sup>[i]</sup></sup></a> The IWW engaged in a genuine form of democracy and a mass industrial organizing model ultimately adopted by the AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO), which both utilized for very different purposes.<a name="_ednref2"><sup><sup>[ii]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>The IWW employed sabotage, direct action and strikes through the equivalent of workers&rsquo; councils in both the community and at the point of production, while disavowing the legitimacy of the state and recognizing that any agreement with business must be temporary. The Wobblies vigorously negotiated with employers but were never deluded that agreements would bring labor peace.</p>
<p>That the solidarity of all workers was not just talk for the IWW is evidenced by their organization of Blacks, immigrant workers from Mexico and Southeast Asia, and women in, for example, the Bread and Roses Strike. Historian Peter Cole has richly demonstrated that the IWW embraced multiracial unionism, perhaps most notably in Philadelphia&rsquo;s Maritime Workers Local 8, where Black workers maintained a majority.iii</p>
<p>The IWW achieved major gains for U.S. workers into the 1930s while (and because) it emphasized solidarity and workers&rsquo; control. When AFL and CIO unions expanded dramatically as a result of upheaval that began in the early 1930&rsquo;s, they, by contrast, mostly failed to stimulate enthusiasm among workers. Riding the massive wave of sit-down strikes to positions of power, leaders of insurgent unions contributed greatly to sublimating the continuation of such militancy by throwing their support behind modest and incomplete New Deal reforms that ultimately <em>weakened</em> the capacity of workers to confront capital directly. In the area of labor relations, the NLRA was the fulcrum.</p>
<p>Many workers who participated in the sit-down strikes in mass production industries considered unionization synonymous with control over the enterprise, as was recognized immediately by capital. Given the breadth and ongoing militancy of the labor upheaval, the most astute corporate leaders soon expressed willingness to yield select rights provided that employer absolutism in the workplace was maintained. The NLRA proved to be the mechanism for doing so and responsible labor leaders proved willing junior partners in quelling worker militancy. For approximately a year after the wave of sit-down strikes, many workers were surprised to learn that their unions, as sanctioned by the NLRA, set up a framework that restricted their autonomy.</p>
<p>In his account of the Flint sit-down strikes, Sidney Fine wrote of how UAW members &ldquo;were reluctant to accept the customary discipline exercised by management&rdquo; and &ldquo;ran wild in many plants for months.&rdquo; Union committeemen aggressively pressed the grievances of union members upon oftentimes unyielding foremen, and as a UAW member later conceded, &ldquo;Every time a dispute came up the fellows would have a tendency to sit down and just stop working.&rdquo;<sup>iv</sup></p>

<p><img src="../../../sites/default/files/images/250x250xSCU.jpg.pagespeed.ic.sV1OVpEWf4/" width="300" height="300" align="right" alt="" />This past Friday, September 25, the National Labor Relations Board issued a new ruling regarding the struggle between the IWW Sisters&rsquo; Camelot Canvass Union and their former bosses at Sisters&rsquo; Camelot.</p>
<p>This new ruling reverses the 2013 ruling by an administrative law judge which stated the workers at Sisters&rsquo; Camelot were not protected under the National labor Relations Act because they were independent contractors. With this decision being reversed, Sisters&rsquo; Camelot is ruled to have violated labor law when they fired Canvass Union member shugE Mississippi while on strike in 2013 as part of their union-busting campaign.</p>
<p>This new ruling also uses the same argument to clarify that Sisters&rsquo; Camelot violated labor law when they refused to negotiate with their worker&rsquo;s union, and again when they offered concessions to workers if they were to abandon bargaining collectively as a union.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 09/20/2015 - 3:18pm</p>
<p><b><strong>By Andrew Stewart</strong></b><b> - <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/18/friedrichs-v-cta-the-supreme-court-case-that-could-destroy-labor-unions-as-we-know-them/" target="_blank"><em>CounterPunch</em></a>, September 18, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/180x187xEWIU620.jpg.pagespeed.ic.fpDvhmbgjh/" alt="" />This Presidential campaign has become even more of a media spectacle than the last two were, which in and of itself proves our electoral system is broken because the voters treat governance like professional wrestling. The Republican field is so close to a Vince McMahon Slam-O-Rama match that we do not even need to come up with silly stage names for these doofuses.</p>
<p>But what stuns me most about the Democratic field is that, even in the midst of our kinda-sorta dialogue about democratic socialism brought about by the Sanders dog-and-pony show, not a single candidate has yet to talk about the cornerstone of a socialist society, our barely-breathing labor unions. We have heard news stories about everyone&rsquo;s favorite walrus, AFL-CIO President <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/afl-cio-endorsement-2016-democratic-primary-119701" target="_blank">Richard Trumka</a>, coming down from on high and reminding the masses that he, not they, get to choose whether the unions endorse Sanders or Clinton. But the elephant in the room which no one is talking about is the <em><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/friedrichs-v-california-teachers-association/" target="_blank">Friedrichs v. CTA</a>&nbsp;</em>Supreme Court case, which has seen the Petitioner Brief filed on September 4, 2015, followed by nineteen amicus curiae briefs on September 10 and. For those just tuning in, this is the case that will destroy labor unions as we know them in our country. This omission from our national dialogue is analogous to the three months before 9-11 when everyone was telling President Bush that something was going to happen but he was too busy farting around on his ranch to care.</p>
