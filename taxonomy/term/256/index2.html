<li><strong>Look to the past to escape Trump's present:</strong> 1946 was the last year of the great general strikes. Trump plans to undo every workers' gain since the 19th century. We need to look back to the lessons from Oakland.</li>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/28/2017 - 11:08pm</p>
<p><strong>By Climate Workers and Movement Generation Justice &amp; Ecology Project - <a href="http://www.climateworkers.org/?p=214" target="_blank">Originally posted on Climate Workers</a>, April 28, 2017; crossposted from <a href="https://ecology.iww.org/node/2218" target="_blank">ecology.iww.org</a>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><b><img src="http://ecology.iww.org/images/PCMMayDay.gif" alt="" align="right" />An Open Letter from Environmental &amp; Climate Justice Organizations on May Day</b></p>
<p>Worker power, immigrant rights, and racial justice must be at the heart of environmental and climate movements</p>
<p>As environmental and climate justice organizations, we declare our support for protests planned for International Workers Day (&ldquo;May Day&rdquo;), May 1st, 2017 and for workers who choose to participate by honoring the general strike.</p>
<p>International Workers&rsquo; Day was first established to commemorate the deaths of workers fighting for the 8-hour work day in Chicago in 1886. It has long been a day to uplift the struggles, honor the sacrifices, and celebrate the triumphs of working people across the world. The day has taken special significance in the U.S. since May 1st, 2006 when 1.5 million immigrants and their allies took to the streets to protest racist immigration policies.</p>
<p>Today, workers face unprecedented attacks on wages, benefits, workplace safety, and the right to organize free from fear and retaliation. But we know that we are all stronger when workers in our communities have safe, fair, and dignified employment with which they can support their families without fear of deportation or violence.</p>
<p>The effects of our fossil fuel economy fall first and worst on working class communities, communities of color, immigrants, and indigenous peoples who have not only contributed the least to climate disruption, but have the least resources to shoulder the burden of a transition to a new, climate-friendly economy. It is these frontline communities who are also at the forefront of change and whose solutions and leadership we most need.</p>
<p>As organizations working to transition our economy away from profit-seeking resource extraction toward ecological resilience and economic democracy, we know that worker power has to be at the heart of that transition.</p>
<p>We urgently need the wisdom and skills of millions of workers to transform our food, water, waste, transit, and energy systems in order to live within the finite resources of this planet that we call home. But the Trump agenda only promises jobs building more prison cells, border walls, bombs, and oil pipelines. Workers deserve not only fair wages, but work that makes our ecosystems and communities more resilient, not destroys them.</p>
<p>Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. No significant social change in this country has come without tremendous risk and sacrifice by ordinary people &ndash; from workers who walk off the job to water protectors facing down water cannons and attack dogs.</p>
<p>As environmental and climate justice organizations, we support workers who choose to walk off their jobs on May 1st because we know that the fight to protect land, water, air and soil is inseparable from the fight to protect the life and dignity of workers, migrants, and communities of color.</p>
<p>To workers participating in protests on May 1st, we say: &ldquo;Thank you. You deserve better. And we&rsquo;ve got your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that end, we join with unions and worker-led organizations throughout the country in asking that there be <b>NO RETALIATION</b> against any worker &ndash; union or non union &ndash; who exercises their rights by taking time off from work on May 1. Further, should workers face retaliation, we pledge our strong support for efforts to defend those workers.</p>

<p><img src="../../../graphics/labor/globsolired.gif" align="right" alt="" />The IWW is a union for all workers. We oppose all forms of discrimination. Therefore, we stand firmly against Trump's recent travel ban targeting Muslims. This step towards official discrimination is an attack on all of us.</p>
<p>The IWW stands for organizing and building power for the most vulnerable workers, including all low-wage workers and immigrants. We are heartened to see the massive resistance that sprang up immediately after the order, with people showing their outrage at airports across the country. We are particularly excited by the New York City taxi workers who stopped service at JFK airport, and the airline workers who refused to comply with the ban. There is a palpable feeling that all decent people understand that we need to stand together on this until every non-citizen is allowed entry into the country without fear of reprisal or repercussion.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 11/22/2016 - 3:41pm</p>
<p><b>Official Statement - IWW General Executive Board, November 22, 2016</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../sites/default/files/images/three_fist.jpg" alt="" align="right" />These are difficult times for the working class, times of struggle and hardship. The employing class controls more of the world&rsquo;s wealth and power than ever before, and the divide between working people and our oppressors grows wider by the day.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that this is nothing new. The ruling class has been waging a war against the working class since the birth of capitalism. We, the workers of the world, continue to be exploited and abused, the value of our labor always falling into the boss&rsquo; pockets. While they rake in unprecedented profits, the employing class continues to damage our planet through the unsustainable and irresponsible extraction of natural resources. These vultures tell you that your disappointments, your failures, and your hardships are the fault of other working class people. People of different races, genders, nationalities, and religions. &ldquo;Blame immigrants,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Blame blacks and Latinos,&rdquo; they say. As we fight amongst ourselves, the ruling class celebrates in their gilded halls, making toasts to the disunity of the working class.</p>
<p>Many people in the working class sought out hope in the electoral system this year, confident that reason and compassion would hold the day. Many other people in the working class were motivated by bigotry. The electoral system is designed to disenfranchise all working people, to take their hopes and desires as mere suggestions rather than as concrete demands. Unions, which are supposed to fight for all working people, organized people to put their faith in fighting bigotry at the ballot box - and now they say they are &ldquo;ready to work with&rdquo; the representatives of bigotry and division.You are no doubt feeling disillusioned, fearful, and angry, and are ready to consider different ways of fighting back against our oppressors.</p>
<p>We, the Industrial Workers of the World, invite you to work with us in building a new kind of labor movement, one that refuses to play by the rules of the employing class. An approach where we no longer allow them to divide us along artificial lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, or religion. From housewives to factory workers to prisoners to office workers, we are all the working class, and it is our labor that creates all wealth. We can challenge the ruling class if we unite with each other, but that unity must start with defending the most oppressed and vulnerable groups among us first, for &ldquo;an injury to one is an injury to all.&rdquo; It is clear that there is a strong current of bigotry within the US working class, and we pledge to confront that head on in our organizing. We believe we can win workers away from bigotry if we show that we have a plan to win a better world. We must work towards the creation of a new world in the shell of the old, and the only way to do that is through organizing in our workplaces and in our communities.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World have been organizing working people for over 110 years, and our future as a revolutionary union is bright. Our approach is one of direct action. Instead of relying on elected officials and other intermediaries, we take the fight directly to our oppressors. We have been trailblazers in the modern labor movement, organizing fast food workers in Oregon, package handlers in Minnesota, entertainers and restaurant workers in New York, and prison laborers throughout the country, to name just a few. Our members have been at the forefront of resistance to police violence and the Dakota access pipeline. We have been working tirelessly to build a genuine and truly representative working class organization that can provide strength to working people, and we need your help.</p>
<p>If you have questions about exactly who we are and what we do, let's talk. If you're ready to organize and resist, join us and we will welcome you as fellow workers and fellow members of the working class. It is time to organize, it is time to fight back. Let's make white supremacists, fascists, and other hate mongers fear our power. Our struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but we will win. Sign up for the One Big Union today, and let&rsquo;s organize together in our workplaces and communities. Nothing is too good for the working class, and we want all the good things life has to offer.</p>
