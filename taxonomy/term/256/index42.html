</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 10/21/2010 - 4:52pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../graphics/syndicalism/cnt_march460.jpg" align="right" width=229 height=133 />I'm exhausted.</p>
<p>I've spent the last three days going from road block to road block, together with teachers, railroad workers, truckers, nurses, etc.</p>
<p>So far, in our sector, we've managed the feat of keeping the Arnages oil depot totally closed since Friday 4 AM!</p>
<p>As a result, all the petrol stations in aradius of 70 kms are closed, completely out of gas.</p>
<p>I slept 4 hours on Friday night, 6 hours on Saturday, 2 on Monday ...</p>
<p>Today, we got the main Teachers' Union to call on all striking teachers to come and help block all the remaining fuel depots.</p>
<p>The police can't intervene, because the truckers have established road blocks on the major roads leading to the oil depot.</p>
<p>What is incredible is that despite the fact that there is no more oil available, and therefore that people are blocked at home, a resounding 71% of the population approves of the strike (according to today's opinion polls).</p>
<p>The movement is set to last at least another week. I spent the whole of Sunday night with transport (railway and truckers) workers playing cards and drinking beer. It was quite cold (2?C) around 4 AM, but the railroad workers brought several truck-loads of "palettes" (empty wooden containers) and we lit a might bonfire.</p>
<p>Striking workers from the neighbouring Renault factory brought firecrackers and we spent the wee hours of the morning lighting them.</p>
<p>Workers are determined to fight until the bitter end. Workers who chose not to go on strike are being encouraged to donate part of their salary to the workers of the most "strategic" sectors, especialy the Donges raffinery.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 09/26/2010 - 1:55pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../graphics/agitators/classic/solidcircleA.jpg" align="right" />This article originally appeared <a href="http://www.newsocialist.org.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=278:a-letter-about-workplace-organizing&amp;catid=53:blog&amp;Itemid=68" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Dear New Socialist Group, <br /><br />A friend recently sent me issue 60 of <em>New Socialist</em>. I enjoyed reading it, especially the discussions of unions and union organizers. I plan to read a lot more of your writings as soon as I'm able. <br /><br />In this letter I'd like to pose some respectful questions and criticisms. I also want to think out some issues I am unclear about and have been having conversations about with some close friends and comrades. Just so we're clear, and since electronic communication makes it much easier to come off polemical when that's not my intention, I mean these as a sort of "can think about this together?" rather than an attempt at the sort of point scoring that sometimes stands in for political discussion. I've only read some of your publications - I plan to read more of them - so if you deal with my questions elsewhere I would love to know. I should also say, I'm a member of the small radical union the Industrial Workers of the World and the small political organization the Workers Solidarity Alliance. My experiences in those organization shape my views, but I write in a personal capacity. <br /><br />I liked the piece on the comrade who worked for SEIU. It did well in getting at some of the limits of AFL-CIO and CtW unionism. I would like to know, however, if she learned anything positive from doing that work. Perhaps she didn't. My experience working as an organizer had a lot of the negative components that that comrade described and others too, which is why I no longer do that kind of work. I ran into iterations of the same problems when I worked as a community organizer too.) <br /><br />That said, as much as working as an organizer was a lousy job, I learned a ton doing that job. As much as the bosses were jerks, I learned a lot from following their orders and from the training they provided. I learned stuff which set me up to go on to organize at my own workplaces in the jobs I worked afterward, and this has enriched my IWW activity too, in my opinion. I'd like to know if NSG has anything to say about working as organizers in order to learn things for a while - not as a career path but as an educational detour. Personally, I think more radicals should so then come back to the shop floor. <br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
