 <title>Demand An End to Worker Retaliation at Ellwood Thompson&#039;s!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/demand-end-worker-retaliation-ellwood-thompsons</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Richmond, Va - On behalf of Rain Burroughs, the Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and Food &amp;amp; Retail Workers United (FRWU) delivered a formal letter to Rick Hood (owner) and Tommy Langford (store manager) on December 21, 2012 requesting that Ellwood Thompson&#039;s Local Market reinstate Rain Burroughs immediately to an equivalent job with comparable pay, benefits, responsibilities, and hours of work. We have yet to receive any response, and we ask for your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain Burroughs was granted, via the federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), leave in order to assist her mother who was struggling with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Burroughs&#039; leave ended on November 20, 2012 when she returned to work at Ellwood Thompson&#039;s Local Market. Rather respect a loyal worker and honoring the commitment that had been made to them, Ellwood Thompson&#039;s chose to label Burroughs as a new hire and placed her on &#039;probation&#039;. This action by Ellwood Thompson&#039;s violates federal law which&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Help Temp Workers Organize &amp; Fight Back!</title>

&lt;p&gt;The continuation of high unemployment is eroding the bargaining power of the working class, and without an organization to collectively harness that power, the working class will continue to be at the will of the economy and it&#039;s architects, the employing class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the workers unable to secure permanent and/or full time employment have been increasingly turning to temporary employment agencies for relief. However, uncertain whether or not they will be chosen for work that day, many leave distraught and empty handed. Those who do find work, are paid a pittance of a wage, barely providing any sort security or stability, unsure of what tomorrow will bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/help-temp-workers-organize-fight-back&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>IWW Direct Action! Demand Unpaid Wages for Worker at 3rd St. Diner in Richmond, Virginia</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-direct-action-demand-unpaid-wages-worker-3rd-st-diner-richmond-virginia</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px; height: 200px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/foodservwork.jpg&quot; /&gt;On behalf of Fellow Worker Moriah &amp;quot;Mo&amp;quot; Karn, the Richmond General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World and IU640 (Restaurant, Hotel, &amp;amp; Building Service Workers Industrial Union) are initiating a campaign to demand that $183.18 in unpaid wages be paid in full to fellow worker Karn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow worker Karn worked as a bartender and waitstaff for 3rd St. Diner located at 218 E. Main St. in Richmond, Virginia. Karn has yet to receive any compensation for their labor after working a total of 86 hours at a wage of $2.13 an hour, between November 3rd and November 22nd, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in the state of Virginia, it is a violation of law to withhold a final paycheck from an employee after removal (see &amp;sect;40.1-29 Va State Code), the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry was of little help.  When fellow worker Karn filed a complaint with the Virginia Department of Labor, they were told that because there was no written proof of their hours worked, ie. a time sheet, schedule, etc., and because the employer failed to process their W2 form, there was nothing the Department of Labor could do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of this news, on Friday April 6, 2012 a letter was issued to owner, Mr. William &amp;quot;Billy&amp;quot; Polyaris, requesting he do the right thing and pay fellow worker Karn in full by 4:00pm Friday April 12, 2012. Informing him that failure to do so would result in further action.  We received no response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the inability of the state to procure justice for workers who are victims of wage theft, and whereas Mr. Polyaris appears to have no remorse for the exploitation of his workers, we call upon supporters to participate in a phone blast, putting pressure on management and demanding retribution and accountability for Karn and her fellow workers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Richmond GMB Sends Letter of Solidarity To U.S. Postal Workers</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/richmond-gmb-sends-letter-solidarity-us-postal-workers</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings Fellow Workers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On  behalf of our Union, the Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch  of the Industrial Workers of the World stand in solidarity with the  United States Postal Workers Union and its effort to preserve the  peoples post office from further privatization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In 1967 U.S. President  Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a Commission on Postal Reorganization,  chaired by AT&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s Frederick R. Kappel, to &amp;ldquo;determine whether the  postal system as presently organized is capable of meeting the demands  of our growing economy and our expanding population.&amp;rdquo; In June 1968, the  Commission found that it was not.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/richmond-gmb-sends-letter-solidarity-us-postal-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>‘Unfair Labor Practice’ at the Forest Hill Crossroads Coffee &amp; Ice Cream</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/%E2%80%98unfair-labor-practice%E2%80%99-forest-hill-crossroads-coffee-ice-cream</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/foodservwork_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;An &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;Unfair Labor Practice&amp;rsquo; &lt;/strong&gt;has been filed with the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nlrb.gov/&quot;&gt;National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; against &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://crossroadsrva.com/&quot;&gt;Crossroads Coffee &amp;amp; Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Richmond, Virginia for a violation of an employee&amp;rsquo;s right to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection, as found in&lt;strong&gt; Sec. 7. [&amp;sect; 157.]&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act&quot;&gt;National Labor Relations Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jun 8, 2011, Holly L., a member of the &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)&lt;/strong&gt;, was terminated after sending an email, a common form of communication, to management and staff. &amp;nbsp;The email addressed Crossroads owner Will Herring&amp;rsquo;s failure to close and lock up the establishment, forcing employees to wait for his arrival well after the end of their shift. This incident is one in a pattern of disrespectful behavior by Mr. Herring towards employees. While individual attempts were made by employees to address the problem, their failure led to the decision that collective action was the logical step towards resolving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intention is not to suggest a boycott of the establishment; rather, we want to join concerned workers and customers in sending a message to management and other Richmond employers that exploitation will not be tolerated. Members of the Industrial Workers of the World firmly believe that all employers, large and small, must respect the rights of its employees &amp;mdash; including the right to an open and safe environment where employee concerns can be addressed without the fear of retaliation. If this simple demand can not be met, the working class will respond as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW Sends Solidarity to Workers at Danville, Virginia IKEA/Swedwood Factory</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-sends-solidarity-workers-danville-virginia-ikeaswedwood-factory</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Fellow Workers of the IKEA/Swedwood Factory in Danville, Virginia,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) would like to offer our solidarity and support for your recent decision to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pslweb.org/liberationnews/news/workers-at-virginia-ikea.html&quot;&gt;seek union representation&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goiam.org.php/imail/latest/8893-iam-files-for-election-at-swedwood-ikea-plant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wood Workers Division of the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State of Virginia has a long history of attracting companies that count on weak labor laws, which without a union can leave workers vulnerable to exploitation. This is why, more than ever, it is important to encourage workers in all industries to unite in class struggle. With an organized working class we can build a labor movement that successfully demands dignity and respect, not only at our respective workplaces, but also in our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time we organize and form a union, the power of the working class is magnified.  It will be through education and organization followed by direct action that an emancipated working class will emerge. United, we can realize not only increased wages, better and safer working conditions, health care, and paid vacations, but also, quality union jobs, better schools, social services, and the enforcement of civil rights, for all workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming days, as you weigh the choice to elect union representation, know that in a &amp;quot;right to work&amp;quot; state such as Virginia, unions can not collectively bargain for &amp;quot;union security&amp;quot;. This means there would be a contract provision negotiated whereby agreeing that all workers who receive economic benefits of union representation also share in the cost of maintaining their union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &amp;quot;right to work&amp;quot; state, workers can &amp;quot;choose&amp;quot; not to pay into the union, escaping their financial obligation to support their union and fellow workers, pay nothing, and still receive all the benefits. The employing class of course supports the &amp;quot;right to work&amp;quot; law because it does for them what they can&#039;t do themselves, financially drain unions, so they don&#039;t have the resources required to protect their fellow workers and further organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, vote union, pay your dues, and demand democracy in the workplace.  As the labor movement grows, so will our strength, and ability to demand the eventual abolition of the class and wage system, effectively removing the means of production from the clutches of the bosses, and placing those means into the hands of the workers, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Solidarity,&lt;br /&gt;
Richmond Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Keep Monroe Park Public: An Open Letter from the Richmond IWW</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5261</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For more information and complete back story refer to: http://monroecampaign.wordpress.com/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear City &amp;amp; Monroe Park Advisory Councils,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people,” states the beginning of our labor union’s preamble. We, the Richmond members of the Industrial Workers of the World, feel that the renovation plans for Monroe Park, as they currently stand, will serve to exacerbate hunger and want in Richmond. We, as concerned citizens of the Richmond area and hardened activists and organizers, will not let this issue slip by without a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These renovation plans include fencing off the entire park for several months, and up to a year, denying access to all who depend on it, including the services provided there. This translates to the homeless being forced out of the park and dispersed into the VCU and Greater Richmond community, without concern for where they might await refuge in otherwise nearby shelters or sustenance via various meal programs that congregate there.&lt;/p&gt;
