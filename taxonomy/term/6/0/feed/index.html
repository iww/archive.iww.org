 <title>Richmond GMB Sends Letter of Solidarity To U.S. Postal Workers</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/richmond-gmb-sends-letter-solidarity-us-postal-workers</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings Fellow Workers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On  behalf of our Union, the Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch  of the Industrial Workers of the World stand in solidarity with the  United States Postal Workers Union and its effort to preserve the  peoples post office from further privatization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In 1967 U.S. President  Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a Commission on Postal Reorganization,  chaired by AT&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s Frederick R. Kappel, to &amp;ldquo;determine whether the  postal system as presently organized is capable of meeting the demands  of our growing economy and our expanding population.&amp;rdquo; In June 1968, the  Commission found that it was not.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/richmond-gmb-sends-letter-solidarity-us-postal-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Bay Area Industrial Workers of the World Statement in Support of Justice for Oscar Grant and Oct 23rd Oakland Labor Rally</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5149</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The following Resolution was adopted by a unanimous voice vote at its August 2010 General Membership Branch Meeting held Thursday, August 5, 2010:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/anarchism/police_brutality01.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=1 height=146 width=211 /&gt;[Begin]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) acknowledge that police violence is a tragic yet common occurrence in working class communities and for people of color. A notable example took place January 1, 2009, when BART police officer Johannes Mehserle brutality shot and killed 22-year-old Oscar Grant without justification.  Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and will be sentenced November 5, 2010.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The IWW firmly rejects police violence and stands beside the family and friends of Oscar Grant.  In recognizing that ‘an injury to one is an injury to all’ the IWW is in solidarity with organized labor and members of the Bay Area community who seek justice for Oscar Grant and jail for Johannes Mehserle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the IWW strongly supports the planned demonstration by labor and community groups Saturday October 23, 2010 at Oakland City Hall and joins in the call to ‘jail killer cops.’&lt;/p&gt;     

&lt;p&gt;[End]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt; The original call out was made by ILWU Local 10, 
AFL-CIO&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Iran: Jailed president of Tehran’s bus workers’ union Mansoor Ossanlou released</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2777</link>

He was warmly greeted by his family and colleagues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ossanlou&amp;rsquo;s release comes following seven months of struggle without let up by Tehran&amp;rsquo;s bus workers and the massive international solidarity that took shape for his release over this period. He was jailed for organising the bus workers and defending their rights. His release is a clear victory for the workers and people in Iran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a statement released today, WPI congratulated Mansoor Ossanlou, his family, the bus workers and all trade unions, organisations and individuals who fought in the great campaign for his release. &amp;ldquo;Ossanlou was freed from prison by the bus workers and all those fantastic people in Iran and outside Iran who fought hard and put pressure on the Islamic Republic&amp;rdquo;, the statement said. It called for the unconditional release of all political prisoners in Iran, the recognition of the bus workers&amp;rsquo; union and an end to the persecution of labour activists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;International Labour Solidarity Committee of the &lt;br /&gt;Worker-communist Party of Iran &lt;br /&gt;Co-ordinator: Shahla Daneshfar (shahla_daneshfar@yahoo.com) &lt;br /&gt;Public Relations: Bahram Soroush (b.soroush@ukonline.co.uk) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kargarn.org/&quot;&gt;www.kargarn.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpiran.org/&quot;&gt;www.wpiran.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lnn.laborstart.org/more.php?id=778_0_1_0_M&quot;&gt;http://lnn.laborstart.org/more.php?id=778_0_1_0_M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>The NAFTA Corridors: Offshoring U.S. Transportation Jobs to Mexico</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2323</link>

The views of the author do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Richard D. Vogel - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monthlyreview.org/0206vogel.htm&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monthly Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, February 2006.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;iexcl;Pobre M&amp;eacute;xico! Tan lejos de Dios, y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos. &lt;br /&gt; (Poor Mexico! So far from God, and so close to the United States.) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; &amp;mdash;General Porfirio Díaz, President of Mexico, 1877&amp;ndash;1911   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/classic/transport_iu.jpg&quot; /&gt;Capital&amp;rsquo;s relentless search for cheap labor constantly alters the flow of surface transportation in North America with widespread consequences. The end-of-century deindustrialization of the United States and importation of cheap commodities from the Far East through the West Coast reversed historical east-west transportation patterns and established Los Angeles and Long Beach as the largest ports in the nation. To minimize transportation costs, which for many products are higher than the cost of production, intermodal transportation of containerized imports was developed. Manufactured goods are packed into mobile shipping containers at factories in the Far East and travel by ship, train, and truck to distribution centers and, ultimately, consumer outlets across the United States. Currently, intermodal transportation of cheap imported commodities is the lifeline of the American economy. In 2004, the Port of Los Angeles processed 7.3 million container units and Long Beach handled 5.8 million. These two ports alone accounted for 68 percent of the West Coast total and are, by far, the largest employers in California. U.S. workers, who have seen so many lucrative manufacturing jobs moved overseas, assumed that import transportation and distribution jobs could not be offshored and were, therefore, relatively secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2323&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>MUNI Social Strike: It&#039;s Coming!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/1276</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/modern/Flint/generalstrike.jpg&quot; /&gt;An inevitable fare hike in the City&amp;rsquo;s public transportation system, San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI), is distressing the most vulnerable members of society: seniors, disabled, low-income residents and students. Bus fares will be going up from $1.25 to $1.50 this September. Along with higher fares, San Franciscans can expect service cuts to bus lines as well as a reduction in driver privileges and mass layoffs. The reason for these changes is to alleviate a $57 million deficit faced by MUNI. Several citizen groups opposing these measures are mobilizing to fight back. One such effort is a social strike planned to coincide with these fare hikes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A very visible strike is set to take place just before bus fares shoot up in September. Protestors will be holding posters, handing out flyers and chanting to encourage riders to ignore fare hikes, and to drivers to allow non-paying riders to board busses and cable cars/street cars. The organizers of the strike, Social Strike.net, say that the issues are clear: this is the second fare hike in 3 years; service cuts include grossly slashing drivers&amp;rsquo; pre and post operation breaks, which raises concerns about public safety and the betrayal of downtown businesses for not paying fees or higher taxes in subsidizing the transportation agency beleaguered with a deficit for several years in exchange for its bussing thousands of employees working at these downtown businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/1276&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
