 <title>Berkeley, CA: IWW Recycling Workers Walk Off Job Over Unpaid Wages</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/berkeley-ca-iww-recycling-workers-walk-job-over-unpaid-wages</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the Bay Area IWW - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-iww-recycling-workers-walk-off-job-over-unpaid-wages/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, August 24, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/12-1068x711.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Workers at Buyback, a recycling centre in Berkeley, have walked off the job this morning after the payment of their wages was delayed without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workers, who are members of the Industrial Workers of the World, discovered at the start of their shift that none of them had received their scheduled payment for the previous fortnight&amp;rsquo;s work, which was due to come through earlier this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the third occasion this year that wages have not been paid on time &amp;ndash; something that can cause extensive problems for the finances of workers and their families. After turning up at 8 AM this morning and being offered no explanation from management for the error, Buyback workers held a union meeting and voted 18-0 to immediately walk out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyback workers have already struck twice this year &amp;ndash; the first an unannounced half-day walkout during the February 16 &amp;lsquo;Day Without Immigrants,&amp;rsquo; and the second a two-hour stoppage to hold a celebratory barbecue on May 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers have not yet returned to work and it&amp;rsquo;s unclear at this stage whether the action will continue into tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Reinventing the Wheel - The REAL Green Jobs Story</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/reinventing-wheel-real-green-jobs-story</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWEUC_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By x356039 - May 2, 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The views expressed here are not the official  position of the IWW (or even the IWW&amp;rsquo;s EUC) and do not necessarily  represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the accepted limits of debate in Washington and Wall Street the main argument by proponents of the fossil fuel industry is the same as its always been: do you want to protect the environment or create more jobs? They argue expanding fossil fuel exploitation, in spite of the proven risks to the environment and public health, is necessary for the sake of job creation. By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57361212/keystone-pipeline-how-many-jobs-really-at-stake/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;building Keystone XL&lt;/a&gt; across the Great Plains, &lt;a href=&quot;http://trib.com/business/energy/environmental-groups-halt-new-powder-river-basin-coal-mining/article_35d8f21e-dc69-5bea-80aa-a65dd8a88a02.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coaldiver.org/coal-diver/Powder-River&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Powder River Basin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/03/wyoming-coal-leases-powder-river-basin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coal interests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/08/offshore-drilling-increase-access-reduce-the-risk-and-stop-hurting-american-companies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nola.com/politics.ssf/2012/07/house_approves_bill_to_greatly.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;offshore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324020504578398610851042612.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drilling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/fracking-revolution-more-jobs-cheaper-energy-worth-manageable-171414515.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opening up&lt;/a&gt; new lands to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midwestenergynews.com/2013/01/10/u-s-chambers-fracking-job-boom-behind-the-numbers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fracking&lt;/a&gt; the fossil fuel dinosaurs claim our economy will recover &amp;amp; energy independence will be achieved. When confronted with the facts on clean energy sources like wind and solar power fossil fuel proponents argue &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cato.org/policy-report/marchapril-2011/high-cost-green-jobs-green-energy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clean energy is too expensive&lt;/a&gt;. They claim it would not be cost-effective to build a green energy economy and that it would lead to a decline in standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite contrary to the boldest of claims made by those dinosaurs the facts show shifting to a clean energy economy would create more jobs, cost less money, and easily exceed all performance needs. Research by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rael.berkeley.edu/greenjobs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Renewable &amp;amp; Appropriate Energy Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; at University of California, Berkeley shows the fossil fuel industry&#039;s claims of better job creation rates compared to green, clean energy are vastly overblown. As shown in this chart below renewable energy sources produce as many if not more jobs per megawatt of capacity as traditional dirty sources of electricity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) put in a lot of legwork on the Hotel Frank picket line, so it was only natural that I responded to their call to join an IWW picket line at the Berkeley Ecology Center last Thursday, January 10.&amp;nbsp; The Ecology Center brags on its website that they &amp;ldquo;provide good, green-collar jobs.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Try telling that to the thirty workers and supporters who were on the picket line last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/berkeley-ecology-center-battles-their-workers-over-%E2%80%9Coldest-existing-iww-contract-known-unive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>IWW iu670 Curbside Recyclers in Berkeley Demand &quot;No Concessions!&quot;</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-iu670-curbside-recyclers-berkeley-demand-no-concessions</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For Immediate Release: Contact Bay Area IWW (510) 845-0540&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow Workers and Supporters of the IWW and the working class: Negotiations for a new contract with the Ecology Center are not going at all well. Their latest proposal includes a worse Kaiser plan, making the workers pay for part of the premium, no raise after the first year of the contract, and a reduction in what the employer pays into the workers&#039; annuity plan. Workers are saying that all they&#039;ve been getting in recent contracts are cuts and where will it all end?&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The Ecology Center is openly saying that they expect &quot;more work for less pay.&quot; A strike on Feb. 1 remains possible. We are organizing a protest rally at the work place for this Thursday at noon. The rally will be held at the corner of Second and Gillman Streets, in Berkeley (near the Gilman Street exit off of Eastshore Freeway / I-80 &amp; 580) where it will be more visible. We urge all supporters to attend and to bring friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IWW has had a union contract with the Ecology Center since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>IWW Shops Hold May Day Rally</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-shops-hold-may-day-rally</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/CurbsideMayDay2012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By John Reimann&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boss was sweating bullets. The IWW was in the house, his workers were about to stop work for May Day, and he wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy about it at all.  But there was nothing he could do about it since all his workers were IWW members and they support the union. This was at Buy Back recycling in Berkeley, which functions under an IWW contract as does Curbside Pickups, the work place next door, whose workers were also about to stop work for May Day, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IWW organizers and union members on the job had been organizing a stop-work rally for the previous two weeks and here it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers from both work places stopped work for about an hour to celebrate International Workers Day in a work place rally. Most of those who spoke were the Curbside and Buy Back workers themselves, and they spoke about the conditions of their jobs and the attacks on their health benefits and other such concerns. A worker at Curbside had recently had a very serious injury (which resulted in having to have a foot amputated). Several Curbside workers commented on this and the belief that the long hours of overtime may well have been related to this, because when workers are tired accidents are more likely to happen. There were several speakers from outside the work place including Boots Riley, the revolutionary Oakland rap artist, who spoke among other things about his experiences with workers in Italy. Other fellow workers spoke on a number of issues including the history of May Day, issues for grocery workers, and on privatization and the union busting in the Oakland public school system. One noteworthy message of greeting was read from a representative of the Pakistan Labor Party. The message referred to some of the strikes in Pakistan recently and concluded by calling for the workers of the world to unite. The rally concluded with a speech from a fellow worker who called for revolution (and got a good hand of applause for that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all gathered round for a group photo taken by one of our members. The executive director of the Curbside operation just &amp;ldquo;happened&amp;rdquo; to be on hand and came running over, a big s___t-eating grin spread over his face. He offered to take the photo for us so that we could all be in the photo at once. We sent him packing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the perfect end to a great event. We started the event by making one boss sweat. We ended it by telling another to get lost. What better way to celebrate International Workers Day?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Open Letter to Ecology Center Board of Directors from the Bay Area IWW</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5153</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To the Board of Directors of the Ecology Center [recycling@ecologycenter.org]:&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;As you are aware, the Industrial Workers of the World represents the workers at Curbside Recycling, which the Ecology Center operates. Over recent years, we have seen a pattern of behavior of your management team that betrays a strong anti-union attitude and borders on outright union busting.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;During negotiations for a new contract in December of 2007, your negotiation team sought to remove from the contract the clause that permits our members to refuse to cross a picket line. In other words, they sought the power to try to turn our members into strike breakers.&lt;/li&gt;
 
&lt;li&gt;During the negotiations for a new contract in December of 2008, Ecology Center management held a captive audience meeting with our members. This meeting, intentionally called without informing the union representatives, was an attempt to treat the Union as an unwanted &quot;third party&quot;. This is a standard method of professional
union busters.&lt;/li&gt;
 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the IWW is filing for arbitration on behalf of one of its members. We are forced to do so due to flagrant violation of the contract by the Ecology Center management. This violation concerns the disciplining of one of our members.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecology Center management decided this member was guilty before they even held a hearing with him to hear his explanation of events.&lt;/li&gt;
 
&lt;li&gt;Ecology Center management illegally demoted this member, in violation of the contract, thus saving themselves $7.50 per hour for every hour this member works.&lt;/li&gt;
 
&lt;li&gt;During the mediation step, the Ecology Center management once again made statements implying that the Union was some outside force, a &quot;third party&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;There are several different avenues that arbitration can take. The Ecology Center management has insisted on taking the most expensive avenue, knowing full well that the IWW is a small union that does not have a large treasury. While we are willing to fight the full length for our members, meaning that we will spend what is necessary, this tactic of the Ecology Center management is not lost upon us, especially in light of their previous actions. Meanwhile, the Ecology Center management team parades behind their &quot;green&quot; and &quot;community oriented&quot; banner while they trample on the rights of their workers and carry on what can only be described as an anti-union policy.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bay Area IWW Labor Protest - Recylcing Workers say &quot;NO!&quot; to management&#039;s proposed cuts! - Thursday, Jan 21, 2010</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4914</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU670/EcologyCenter/iu670rally1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;The IWW is engaged in contract discussions with the Ecology Center, which runs Curbside Recycling - the outfit that picks up recyclable trash in Berkeley. They have presented a series of demands for draconian cut backs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This includes demanding that the workers pay 20% of the cost of their health insurance premiums. Their position is that everywhere else such cuts are being instituted and they have to do the same. Our position is that these cuts have to be stopped somewhere, or, to paraphrase Harry Truman, &amp;quot;the cuts stop here.&amp;quot; At the same time, Buyback - the recycling yard that is on the same property as Curbside and also under IWW contract - has announced that they will be laying off a worker, a first there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The IWW is holding a &amp;quot;safety meeting&amp;quot; rally to protest these twin events. This will be in their yard at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 21. The yard is on 2nd Street, just north of Gillman in north Berkeley (near the freeway).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are urging all  union members and supporters, students and community members to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/4914&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Bay Area IWW iu670 Organizing Committee Urges:  Bail out the Public Sector!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4578</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
Practically every state, county and city in the country is in fi nancial crisis and the plan is to make you pay for it. (for details see attached PDF)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This crisis is actually getting worse, and all these projected defi cits will probably continue to increase. If allowed to pass, these cuts will only get worse. Other cities in the area and most states in the country face similar or worse deficits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We do not have to be the victims! There is a solution!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, the federal government has committed some $7 trillion to bail out banks, insurance companies and even the auto industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And many of these banks, they won’t even tell us, the taxpayers, how they are spending that money. This is our money and we have every right to say how it gets spent!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the federal government can bail out Corporate America, then they can bail out “public America”. The unions should all get together and call mass public meetings to organize a campaign to demand that federal bail-out money be used to eliminate the budget defi cits of our cities, counties and states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No cuts in services, public jobs or pay of public workers and retirees&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use federal bail out money to make up the budget shortfalls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Who we are&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Industrial Workers of the World is a union that currently represents several different workforces. We have a long, revolutionary tradition in American’s labor movement. We do not seek to compromise the interests of workers to benefit the employers. We want to work with the rest of the unions and with all workers’ organizations to launch this campaign:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;IWW-Represented Workplaces:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Buyback Recycling (Berkeley)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Curbside Pickup (Berkeley)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shattuck Cinema (Berkeley)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stonemountain &amp;amp; Daughter retailer (Berkeley)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The IWW is also conducting a nation-wide organizing campaign at Starbucks, as well as other organizing drives nationally. 
&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4568</link>
 <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU670/EcologyCenter/iu670rally1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
Union and Ecology Center Sign Contract The &amp;quot;non-profit&amp;quot; Ecology Center, under contract with the City of Berkeley, runs the Curbside recycling pickup program in that city. We, the IWW, are the representatives of these workers. The economic (wages and benefits) portion of this contract expired on Jan. 1 and we have been in negotiations for the last several months (up until today operating on a contract extension).
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Basically, the position of the Ecology Center (EC) is that because 
the City of Berkeley is having a budget crisis (as are almost all other cities), that they could not afford a decent raise and, in fact, had to reduce the level of health benefits. They also made the claim that since they are a non-profit that we should regard them differently. Neither the workers nor the Union was buying this. This is especially so because they refused to give us the figures for how much it costs to run Curbside and, therefore, how much of the contract with the 
city they are creaming off of the top to finance other EC operations and salaries.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Their offer ended up as being a 3% wage increase plus a payment of $2,000 per year into each worker&#039;s 401(k) plan. In addition, family members of the workers would be covered by the health plan before 
they have been up until now. This was an improvement over their original offer which did not include the $2,000 payment but did include a demand for a significantly worse health care package.
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>IWW Workers at Curbside Ready to Strike - Solidarity Needed</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4530</link>
 <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU670/EcologyCenter/iu670rally1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;244&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
Everyone - Workers at Curbside recycling are bargaining over wages and benefits 
on their contract. This is to take effect starting Jan. 1. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
We do not have 
an agreement yet. The Ecology Center, which runs Curbside has taken the
position that any agreement in January will not be retroactive to Jan. 
1.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Workers at Curbside have decided that unless they back down on this, 
they will strike on Jan. 1. A strike is not definite; management could 
still change its position on this, but we need to begin preparing for a 
strike now. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Anybody who can get out to Curbside first thing Friday, Jan. 2 
first thing in the morning - your presence would be greatly appreciated. I 
think we need to start gathering at 6:30 a.m., but if people can only come 
later, this would be good too.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Call 510-845-0540 for details.   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
