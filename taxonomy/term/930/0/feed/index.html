 <title>Inmates Launch Month-Long Strike to Protest &#039;Slavery Conditions&#039; in Florida Prisons</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/9048</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Julia Conley - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/01/15/inmates-launch-month-long-strike-protest-slavery-conditions-florida-prisons&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, January 14, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ecology.iww.org/images/OpPush1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Inmates in Florida&#039;s prisons launched a month-long strike on Monday in protest of the state&#039;s use of &amp;quot;modern day slavery&amp;quot; within its correctional facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://fighttoxicprisons.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/fl-prisoners-announce-operation-push-starting-jan-15-to-cripple-prison-system/&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons, one of several advocacy groups supporting the movement, the state&#039;s prisoners urged the prison population to refuse all work assignments during the strike:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are encouraging prisoners throughout the DOC to band together in an effort to demand payment for work performances...Our goal is to make the Governor realize that it will cost the state of Florida millions of dollars daily to contract outside companies to come and cook, clean, and handle the maintenance. This will cause a total BREAK DOWN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African-Americans make up about a third of Florida&#039;s prison population, despite accounting for only about 17 percent of the state&#039;s overall population. Calling their movement Operation Push, after Rev. Jesse Jackson&#039;s 1970s campaign to improve the economic status of African-Americans, the state&#039;s inmates are fighting against the Department of Corrections&#039; price-gouging practices and Florida&#039;s &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.floridatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/syndicated/2016/05/21/dockery-bring-back-parole-florida/84653180/&quot;&gt;elimination of parole&lt;/a&gt; as well as its use of unpaid labor by prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida is one of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/&quot;&gt;five states&lt;/a&gt; that offers no payment to inmates for their work&amp;mdash;from washing prison uniforms and cooking meals to completing maintenance work and serving on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/unpaid-florida-prison-inmates-being-used-on-hurricane-irma-cleanup-labor-crews-9701867&quot;&gt;cleanup crews&lt;/a&gt; after Hurricane Irma hit the state last September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&#039;s a word for that, it&#039;s called slavery,&amp;quot; Paul Wright, executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/florida-prisoners-martin-luther-king-day-strike-slavery&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Guardian.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Some states might say they pay 10 cents a day, or 15 cents an hour, or whatever, but here they make it pretty clear they don&#039;t pay prisoners anything, they&#039;re not going to, and prisoners are totally enslaved at every level.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of receiving no compensation for their work, inmates&amp;mdash;and their families&amp;mdash;have to come up with money to afford food and other items sold in prisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We can no longer allow the state to take advantage of our families&#039; hard earned money by over-charging us,&amp;quot; wrote the inmates in their statement. &amp;quot;Take for example: one case of soup on the street cost $4.00. It costs us $17.00 on the inside. This is highway robbery without a gun. It&#039;s not just us that they&amp;rsquo;re taking from. It&#039;s our families who struggle to make ends meet and send us money&amp;mdash;they are the real victims that the state of Florida is taking advantage of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Lives Matter, several local chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America, and Florida State University&#039;s NAACP chapter are among more than 100 groups that have announced their support for the movement. Many of the groups planned to hold a rally with inmates&#039; friends and families at the state&#039;s Department of Corrections on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>I Am Tired of Healthcare</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/i-am-tired-healthcare</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Luz Sierra - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwwmiami.wordpress.com/2015/08/05/i-am-tired-of-healthcare/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miami IWW&lt;/a&gt;, August 5, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/injuries.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Five years had passed since I first began working as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). A CNA is a health care provider that assists Registered Nurses (RN&amp;rsquo;s). They are the ones considered to do the &amp;ldquo;dirty work&amp;rdquo; in healthcare: changing, bathing, feeding, and providing any form of assistance to patients that RN&amp;rsquo;s do not have the time or opportunity to provide in today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced and multi-tasking health care environment. Through providing care to patients, I have seen many of the atrocities of today&amp;rsquo;s society, especially with mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past year I was offered a patient companion (sitter) position at a local hospital after being laid off at my previous workplace for organizing. It is a pretty chill job. Depending on the census, I either provide one-to-one care or one-to-two patients care who are at risk to fall and are under Baker Act (a Florida mental health law that forces a patient to remain in the facility and to be under supervision up to 72 hours because of potential harm to self or others), or high risk patients likely to be injured. Throughout the majority of my employment there, I have mostly seen patients with mental health disorders. Among them are the elderly that are diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. In my experience, they are not given enough or any treatment at all. They are only given medication that sedates them for hours or they are simply ignored by RN&amp;rsquo;s. An individual with such an ailment could become very anxious, agitated, and disorientated which leads to many problems. For instance, they often attempt to get out of bed unsafely due to memory loss, they can remove their intravenous therapy (IV) if they are bothered by it, and they will sometimes attempt to physically hurt people they do not recognize as they become anxious and fearful of everyone. The list can go on. Mental health disorders are not easily treated, so there are moments when you will need help from CNA&amp;rsquo;s, RN&amp;rsquo;s, or even administration. Unfortunately such help is non-existent at times, like one day at work when I was assigned a patient that had Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s and was extremely confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that day I received the patient in a difficult situation. The first moment I arrived to her room, she was already punching and kicking the CNA who was trying to prevent her from getting out of bed. The CNA warned me to be careful since she was very combatant; she wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying. I spent the first two hours preventing her from getting out of bed while she attempted to repeatedly punch and kick me. Eventually a physical therapist stopped by and walked her to the bathroom and around the room. Afterwards, the nurse provided her medication that calmed and reoriented her. After taking her medication, the patient began to talk to me kindly, telling me about her life until she fell asleep for about thirty minutes. When she woke up, the medication was no longer effective so she was agitated and confused again. She wanted to leave her room, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to, so she was pushing and hitting me, and screaming loudly for help. I wanted to back away from her since that&amp;rsquo;s what you are taught when dealing with an aggravated patient, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t as she was trying to get up and placing herself at risk of falling. I called the nurse to tell her what was happening, but all she did was stop by and talk to the patient. When she left, the patient became aggressive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next three hours I called the nurse five times, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything other than try to calm the patient through talking to her. There&amp;rsquo;s no problem with that but if the patient is hurting herself and trying to attack caregivers there should be a better alternative. I am not a big advocate of medication, but in my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s better to sedate a patient in order to prevent any further harm if the RN is not going to be there 24/7 and if a patient companion has limited options to prevent a patient from hurting anyone or herself. &amp;nbsp;Luckily, another nurse stopped by and took the patient to visit her husband who was also hospitalized. I was ordered to stay with her as she visited her husband. She was calm for a while, but then became agitated and wanted to leave the room in order to search for her children who weren&amp;rsquo;t there. I had to take her back to her room where she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to stay, and spent another three hours walking back and forth from her room to her husband&amp;rsquo;s room. Along the way she would hit and scream at me while the nursing staff were all watching and did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/i-am-tired-healthcare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
