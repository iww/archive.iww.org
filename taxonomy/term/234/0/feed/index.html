 <title>On the Death of a Fellow Worker</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3341</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/classic/clocksm1.jpg&quot; /&gt;Dear friends and fellow workers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recently have been informed that a fellow worker of ours from the cafeteria in the basement of the business school, James Kirk, has sadly passed away Friday afternoon. Aswould be expected, a lot of the workers are absolutely shocked at the news of his passing. We took it upon ourselves to inform you all about the news, as I know that most of us (at least laptop support) go down on our 15 minute breaks to get a bite to eat, some snacks, or even a hot meal from the kitchen. But it&#039;s not just the workers who get their food prepared by these workers every day, it&#039;s students as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are planning to host a candle lit vigil on the M in the diag (in front of the Grad Library and shapiro) and have a moment of silence for James sometime this week which would include all of the Ross Business school employees and also the students organizing in the temps campaign to show appreciation for his work here at the University. This is an issue near and dear to us, not only because James was a fellow worker, but because James might have been able to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment for his condition had he been given access to UHS; a struggle closely tied to the temps campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in attending or have any other ideas of ways to have a remembrance for our fellow worker and friend go ahead and let us know. You can call an IWW organizer at (734) 272-2321. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very sad time for all of us, so I believe staying together and staying strong is a rather important for us at this time.  We will keep everyone posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest In Peace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Temps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3341&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>University of Michigan Temps Organizing Campaign</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3293</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/modern/others/strike_chalkboard.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://isupportthetemps.blogspot.com/2007/03/quick-update-and-big-thanks-to-ann.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Originally posted from the Michigan Temp Workers blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temps at the business school just want to give an update to the community on what&#039;s happening so far. We&#039;ve received phone-ins and email support from the Ann Arbor community, around the country, and around the globe. We&#039;ve had students come forth and assist with signature collection and engage fellow students on campus about the organizing drive. We&#039;ve had other workers and other unions lend their thanks and support as well. You&#039;re feedback has been essential to keeping this organizing campaign all together. Without you, it wouldn&#039;t have been possible. Pat yourselves on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for a quick update. We&#039;ve been running back and forth and emailing management for the last two days trying to bring them to the negotiating table to discuss the issues we raised on Monday. Communication from management has been sporadic. We are under the assumption right now that the Business School wants to frame this as an HR (The Business School&#039;s Human Relations department) issue and try to avoid management having to deal with the very policies they have a hand in implementing. We are fully aware that administrators within the business school have the capacity to make the changes we are asking them to make. We just have to convince management of their own capacity to enact them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, once again, at this point in the campaign we&#039;re trying to put management to task and meet up with us to discuss implementing the issues we&#039;ve raised. Management seems hesitant to act without HR&#039;s approval. That&#039;s where we are at as we lead into Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be sending a few organizers to speak on the 15th at the Campus Unite! rally on the diag. We&#039;ve got a 5 minute spot and we will engage everyone there on the campaign and give a quick update. Campus groups are calling for the rally to occur at the cube at 2:30PM on the 15th. Look for us there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Temps&lt;/p&gt;</description>
