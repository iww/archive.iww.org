<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../graphics/IU460/NYCmisc/flaum-080510.jpg" />A Williamsburg kosher food company is locked in a battle with former workers who charge they were stiffed out of overtime pay - and then fired when they complained.</p>
<p>National Labor Relations Board investigators found that Flaum Appetizing Corp. illegally booted the workers, and ordered the company to cough up around $260,000 in back pay. But owner Moshe Grunhut has refused to comply - saying he won't pay the workers because they're undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The fired employees said they spent years working as much as 80 hours a week for minimum wage with no overtime, for bosses who often peppered them with verbal abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;I worked 11 years for that company and I never received a dollar of overtime or one holiday or one sick day, nothing,&quot; said Gustino Romero, 32, of Bushwick. &quot;I worked from 7 in the morning until 10 or 11 at night. ... We always asked for [overtime], but they said no.&quot;</p>
<p>Maria Corona, 36, of Williamsburg, said frequent insults from her boss made the situation worse.</p>
<p>&quot;The manager called us cockroaches, tarantulas, all kinds of offensive names,&quot; she said. &quot;The truth is we were unfairly exploited.&quot;</p>
<p>When the workers tried to form a union and went on a brief strike in 2008, management ordered them off the Flaum premises - a move the National Labor Relations Board ruled was illegal retaliation.</p>

<a href="../../../../node/5244/" rel="bookmark">Statement of Brandworkers on the Anti-Free Speech Legal Action Filed by the Flaum Appetizing Corp.</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 10/21/2010 - 4:46pm</p>
<p>Contact: <u>press [at] brandworkers.org</u></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU460/NYCmisc/flaum-080510.jpg" align="right" width=270 height=171 />Brandworkers is proud to stand with the immigrant employees campaigning to bring the Flaum Appetizing Corporation into compliance with the rule of law. For years, Flaum, one of the top processors and distributors of kosher foods in New York, illegally withheld overtime pay, denied workers any benefits, and ultimately subjected workers to vicious retaliation when they stood up for their rights. Though the workers prevailed after a full trial over the company's retaliation, owner Moshe Grudhut has done nothing but resist the court's order and has failed to compensate workers for over $260,000 in lost pay. Grudhut owes hundreds of thousands more in unpaid overtime but has refused attempts at reasonable settlement.</p>
<p>It's ironic then that after years of law-breaking, Flaum and Grudhut are invoking the legal process with charges at the National Labor Relations Board in an effort to restrain the peaceful, dignified communications of the workers' campaign for justice. The workers and their supporters are currently on the streets and in the communities of New York City educating customers about the reality of employment at Flaum. The charges that the company has filed seek to prevent the workers' campaign from educating customers where Flaum products are sold.</p>
<p>Grudhut has silenced the workers' voices for too long and far from having their intended effect, these anti-speech charges only strengthen the workers' resolve to win respect for their hard work. Because consumers have a right to know, the workers will continue educating potential customers of Flaum products about the abuses they've suffered and the unwillingness of Grudhut to comply with a standing court order.</p>
<p>In addition to Flaum-branded products including pickles, hummus, and other Middle Eastern appetizers, the company sells kosher products under the Sonny & Joe's label and distributes dairy products from Tnuva and cut produce from the Bodek company. It appears that one of the biggest sellers of Flaum products, the KRM Kollel supermarket, is cooperating with Flaum's anti-free speech legal action.</p>
<p>The right to freedom of speech and freedom of association is the bedrock of a free society and finds protection in both domestic and international law. Brandworkers will defeat this crass attempt to silence workers' voices and will press on until justice is won at the Flaum Appetizing Corporation.</p>
<p>Brandworkers is a New York-based not-for-profit organization protecting and advancing the rights of retail and food employees. By empowering employees with legal, advocacy, and organizing tools, Brandworkers wins fairness on the job and challenges corporate misconduct in the community.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../category/branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

<p>National Lawyers Guild Labor & Employment Committee and Immigrant Workers of the Campaign for Justice at Flaum Appetizing to Be Honored at the 2nd Annual Brandworkers Awards Dinner</p>
<p>New York, NY -- Leading lights from the progressive legal and organizing communities will be honored on October 28th at the 2nd Annual Brandworkers Awards Dinner. The National Lawyers Guild Labor & Employment Committee and the Workers of the Campaign for Justice at Flaum Appetizing Corp. will receive "Champions of Economic Justice" awards to honor their achievements in the movement to win fair pay, equality, and respect for all workers.</p>
<p>"We couldn't be more gratified to honor these inspiring fighters for economic justice," said Daniel Gross, the founding director of Brandworkers. "They are in the trenches every day waging innovative and dynamic campaigns for workplace justice and dignity. It's an honor for Brandworkers to acknowledge their tremendous contributions to the movement."</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Guild Labor & Employment Committee is the country's leading organization of progressive lawyers, legal workers, and law students serving labor unions, worker centers, and individual employees. The Committee is on the cutting-edge of providing innovative legal strategies to combat the intense employer resistance that characterizes organizing drives in the United States today. Firm believers in the need for global solidarity, the Committee and its members are leading participants in the international labor rights arena and recently helped spearhead the landmark amicus brief to the Mexican Supreme Court, filed by 47 prominent labor rights organizations and attorneys from around the world, in opposition to the Mexican Government's attempt to undermine the independence of the National Union of Mine, Metal, Steel and Allied Workers.</p>
<p>The Workers of the Campaign for Justice at Flaum Appetizing Corp. are recent immigrants from Mexico and Ecuador using innovative legal, advocacy, and organizing tools to challenge sweatshops conditions at one of New York City's top processors and distributors of kosher foods. The workers are members of the Focus on the Food Chain campaign, a joint initiative of Brandworkers and the Industrial Workers of the World (NYC) labor union, to create good, family-supporting jobs in the food processing and distribution warehouses of New York. Flaum Appetizing illegally withheld hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation owed to workers and responded with vicious anti-immigrant retaliation when workers stood up for their rights. Despite the illegal retaliation, the workers of Flaum, through diligent and creative organizing, are well on their way to win justice at the company. The workers' effort to limit the scope of the Hoffman Plastic Supreme Court case, which condoned discrimination against many workers based on immigration status, could have important ramifications for workplace justice projects across the country.</p>
