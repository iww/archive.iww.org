</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 01/22/2018 - 7:52pm</p>
<p><strong>By Stardust Family Unted - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/new-york-wobbly-waiters-stage-sip-demand-iww-recognition/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, January 17, 2018 </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This following report and video comes from the Stardust Family Diner, which is a group of workers who are fighting as part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to be in a union. Recently the workers won the rehiring of several dozen employees who were fired in an anti-union campaign conducted by management.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthanatosgonzales%2Fvideos%2F10154606622636155%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="317" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Some footage (video, above) from (January 16, 2018) &ldquo;Sip In&rdquo; at Stardust diner, where servers and former staff are fighting for the right to join a union (that&rsquo;s right, they&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">don&rsquo;t even have the right to fight for their rights), along with a laundry list of other abuses perpetuated by management.</span></p>
<p>The idea was to disrupt the Saturday dinner rush&mdash;several arrived, were seated, and only ordered water (with copious amounts of lemon), stayed for an hour or so, tipped the server generously (so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be punished financially), and then as we left, told the manager that they should allow the servers to join the union.</p>
<p>The very talented singing staff started the action by singing Twister Sister&rsquo;s &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Not Gonna Take It&rdquo; (feat. in the musical &ldquo;School of Rock&rdquo;), then went into Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Union Maid.&rdquo; During the chorus (&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t scare me, I&rsquo;m sticking to the union&hellip;&rdquo;), those participants in the diner, stood up, held their waters and ketchup bottles aloft and sang along (To the wtf-bewilderment of all the tourists). Then one of the servers who was fired last week for joining the union came in off the streets, grabbed a mic, and somehow turned &ldquo;New York, New York&rdquo; into an accusatory political anthem. She stood on the booth, pointed to the patrons, and after she belted the final note, raised her fist, and shouted &ldquo;Worker&rsquo;s Rights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Best dinner in quite a while&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>By Lawrence Goun and Biko Koenig</strong></p>
<p>Workers at Tom Cat Bakery sharpened their resistance against company attacks this summer with a solidarity BBQ in front of the Queens-based factory. Tom Cat's private equity owners, Ancor and Merit Capital, are seeking devastating health care cuts and other takeaways from workers in contract negotiations with the Bakery Union. Dual-card IWW members are leading a struggle to build long-term power and secure a good contract, after beating back a de-certification attempt from a mob-dominated union earlier this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These out-of-town investors already have their mansions, while we barely can support our families. The cuts they're demanding are impossible and we're united against them,&rdquo; said Marino Aquino, a night-shift packer at Tom Cat and a member of the IWW. &ldquo;Our unity is our strength and we will keep the pressure on until justice prevails.&rdquo;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../category/branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

<p>A federal judge has awarded a group of immigrant workers over $950,000 in unpaid wages for work at a Queens-based beverage distributor. A group of Latino warehouse workers and truck drivers brought the class action lawsuit against Beverage Plus and its owners after years of disrespect and systematic violations of state and federal law, violations which the judge found were intentional. The workers are members of Focus on the Food Chain, a coalition promoting good jobs and a sustainable food system in New York City's growing food processing and distribution sector.</p>
<p>&quot;My co-workers and I were deprived of our pay and badly exploited but we finally learned about our rights,&quot; said Richard Merino, who drove a delivery truck at Beverage Plus for six years and was a named plaintiff in the case. &quot;We stood up together and now justice has arrived for us and more importantly for our families.&quot;</p>
<p>Beverage Plus employees were worked as many as twelve hours a day, deprived of overtime, and subjected to unlawful deductions from their pay.</p>

<p><b>By Daniel Gross - May 7, 2012</b></p>
<p>We are overjoyed to announce the biggest victory yet from Focus on the Food Chain!&nbsp; Workers at Flaum Appetizing, with your unwavering support, have won their campaign with an exemplary global agreement.&nbsp; Our members have recovered $577,000 in unpaid wages and compensation for retaliation along with a binding code of conduct ensuring Flaum comports with all workplace rights going forward including anti-discrimination and health &amp; safety protections.<br />
<br />
You can check out some of the press coverage on today's victory:<br />

<br />
For over a decade, workers at Flaum Appetizing worked grueling sixty to eighty hour work weeks without overtime pay and sometimes not even the minimum wage.&nbsp; Latino workers were subjected to constant verbal harassment and forced to work at unsafe speeds.&nbsp; Focus on the Food Chain, a joint project of Brandworkers and the NYC IWW, helped the workers launch a powerful campaign that persuaded over 120 grocery store locations to remove Flaum products from their shelves and convinced the world's largest kosher cheese company to stop using Flaum as a distributor until workers' rights were respected. In the process, Flaum workers won a precedent-setting victory at the Labor Board in D.C. helping workers nationwide fend off unfounded allegations into their immigration status.<br />

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 04/01/2012 - 7:50pm</p>
<p><b>By Daniel Gross - March 29, 2012</b></p>
<p>I write with great emotion, gratitude, and hope for the future. Nothing has reached as deep into the soul of the Brandworkers community as the crushing death of Juan Baten in a Brooklyn tortilla factory at the beginning of last year. <strong>And nothing has fortified our determination for change as much as the courageous efforts of Juan's widow, Rosario Ramirez, to achieve justice for Juan and their daughter Daisy Stephanie.</strong></p>
<p>Juan lost his life because of his employer's reckless disregard for worker health &amp; safety, a problem of endemic proportions in New York City's food processing factories and distribution warehouses. OSHA, the federal workplace safety agency, concluded that Juan's death would have been prevented had the employer placed a legally required and simple machine guard on the mixer that brutally ended Juan's life. After Juan's death, the factory owner Erasmo Ponce and fellow managers threatened workers if they cooperated with investigators, lied about Juan's death, and even disrespected Rosario at Juan's funeral.</p>
<p>Who would have challenged the employer's false narrative in the media and to government authorities if not for you, the Brandworkers community?</p>
<p>Who would have raised thousands of dollars for Rosario and Daisy if not for you, the Brandworkers community?</p>
<p>Who would have persistently advocated for Erasmo Ponce's arrest to the Office of the Attorney General if not for you, the Brandworkers community?</p>
<p>After this lengthy struggle and with your accompaniment, on Tuesday Rosario finally got some of the solace she so profoundly deserves.<strong> Authorities arrested sweatshop owner Erasmo Ponce on 26 felony counts and 23 misdemeanor counts, including falsifying business documents, wage-related violations, and misconduct in connection with the unemployment and workers compensation systems.</strong></p>
