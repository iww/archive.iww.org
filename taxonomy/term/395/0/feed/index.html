 <title>Operation Sold Out II: The Failed General Strike in British Columbia in 2004</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2245</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; - The following article is reposted here because it is an issue with some relevance to the IWW. The views of the author do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Paul Finch - external secretary of Northwestern Anarchist Federation, formerly FNAC; reposted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://nefac.net/node/1947&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nefac.net&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant period of labor unrest in British Columbia since 1983 took place in late April and early May of 2004, as a result of the failed province-wide &amp;ldquo;General Strike&amp;rdquo; movement. During this period, dissatisfaction with government policies and ensuing legislation escalated into wildcat strikes, walkouts, and significant mass public support for the actions of labor unions, community groups, and students in opposition to the government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Free Speech Riots 1909 &amp; 1911</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/1526</link>
 <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; - The following article is reposted here because it is an issue with some relevance to the IWW. The views of the author do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riots: Part of your Vancouver heritage - By Michael Barnholden, Oct, 20 2005&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth. We find that the centring of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever-growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/1526&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
