 <title>The fight against Felipe Serna and wage theft in Houston</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/fight-against-felipe-serna-and-wage-theft-houston</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By The Houston IWW Solidarity Network - &lt;a href=&quot;https://htowniwwsolnet.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/the-fight-against-felipe-serna-and-wage-theft-in-houston/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Houston IWW&lt;/a&gt;, July 29, 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Houston IWW is engaged in a fight with a local contractor, Felipe  Serna, responsible for wage theft of three former employees: Hector,  Pancho, and Mauricio.&amp;nbsp; These three men were hired by Felipe Serna in May  of 2015 for the remodeling of a house in Sweeny, Texas.&amp;nbsp; They were  offered $150/day each for their services and provided room and board at  the house.&amp;nbsp; Several days in Serna decides $150 is too much and instead  wants to pay them $100/day instead.&amp;nbsp; The men held their ground, stating  $150 was the agreed upon wage, and Serna backed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at work one day, Serna tells the men he is letting them go.&amp;nbsp;  The men ask for payment for the previous three days of labor and Serna  refuses, accusing them of stealing equipment.&amp;nbsp; To add insult to injury,  Hector, Pancho, and Mauricio weren&amp;rsquo;t driven back to Houston, but told to  make their own way.&amp;nbsp; It cost them $100 total for them to get  transportation back to the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serna and his actions are not an isolated event nor is he an employer  that is merely a &amp;ldquo;bad apple that spoils the bunch.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; In fact, Serna is  representative of a social force that is exploiting immigrant labor in  Houston and in this country.&amp;nbsp; In fact, $750 million in wages are stolen  each year in Houston alone!&amp;nbsp; Despite a recent ordinance passed in  Houston to curb wage theft, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped it nor could it.&amp;nbsp; The  reality is that Houston capitalists depend on wage theft to maintain  existing profit rates and the social hierarchy.&amp;nbsp; This exploitation is  backed by a racist Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office run by Adrian Garcia that complies  with 287g, Secure Communities, a program of collaboration between the  police and ICE to deport and detain immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of this perspective, on Friday, July 24th, the Houston  IWW with Hector and Pancho marched to The Growing Tree Academy, a  daycare facility in the Gulfton area of Houston to deliver demands to  Serna, owned by his wife&amp;rsquo;s family.&amp;nbsp; Because contractors often operate in  the shadows, working from their homes and vehicles, they are difficult  to track down.&amp;nbsp; Hector read the demand letter in the presence of our  union to the staff who kept interrupting him and declaring they have  nothing to do with what happened.&amp;nbsp; Serna wasn&amp;rsquo;t there but showed up  later when most of us had left to say he wanted to talk and he was  instructed to follow up on the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are demanding $1,450 in stolen wages including $100 for transportation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector, Pancho, and Mauricio aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid of these employer thugs  who prey on working class people.&amp;nbsp; And neither is the IWW.&amp;nbsp; Work itself  is theft.&amp;nbsp; But to steal the little subsistence we are given to reproduce  ourselves and our families is despicable.&amp;nbsp; The only way to deal with  bosses like Serna is to organize together and fight together.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW Victory at Exchange Tower</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-victory-exchange-tower</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;By Chris Ford, Industrial Workers of the World, London Regional Secretary - March 5, 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today after a long and high profile campaign the IWW secured a victory for our cleaner members mployed at Exchange Tower who will now be paid the London Living Wage of &amp;pound;8.30 per hour. For ten years many members have been earning poverty wages on the minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the IWW immediately set about changing this situation launching a campaign for the London Living Wage, this saw widespread publicity, a motion in Parliament, our members stood firm in the face of the intimidation of the management company Cashmens who also managed Heron Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 8th IWW in Frankfurt and industrial unionists in Warsaw and Tokyo were planning solidarity demonstrations at the offices of the MGPA owners of Exchange Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  the employers have conceded to the just demands of the workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the traditional unions at Canary Wharf have abandoned cleaners - full-time officials declared &#039;you need to keep your head down in a recession&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IWW has continued to fight, organising the unorganised, the abandoned and the betrayed. At Reuters nearby IWW is engaged in another campaign for the London Living Wage and for the removal of a gang of a feral managers intimidating cleaners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains at Exchange Tower send a clear message  that  solidarity wins justice in the workplace! Thank you to all our members and supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
