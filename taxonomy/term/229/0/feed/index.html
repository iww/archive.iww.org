 <title>Help Needed for Chicago IWW Freshii Workers&#039; Union Organizers! Donate Today!</title>

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Freshii workers at 200 w Randolph in Chicago marched on their boss to demand the return of nearly $2,000 in stolen wages and union recognition. Of the two demands, the stolen wages were returned to the workers. While the fight for union recognition continues, Heather Sprigler has been illegally fired in retaliation for her role in the organizing efforts. Last week, Alison Olhava fell ill and her boss, Peter Irie, cut her hours from a normal 35 a week to a dismal 8. Peter has refused to meet with Alison and her IWW representatives to discuss this change in scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/help-needed-chicago-iww-freshii-workers-union-organizers-donate-today&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>31st Street Transit Co-operative</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5203</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://chicagoiww.wordpress.com/2010/09/25/31st-street-transit-co-operative/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood has been without accessible bus service for over a decade.  The CTA’s 31st st. bus route was eliminated as a ‘cost-cutting measure’ in 1998, leaving schools, businesses, and residents isolated from the city’s expansive transit network.  The Little Village community, LVLHS, and the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization spent years mounting &lt;a href=&quot;http://areachicago.com/p/issues/institutions-and-infrastructures/busy-building-buslines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an unsuccessful campaign &lt;/a&gt;to reopen/expand the CTA’s 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; St. route; as of the recent cuts in bus service throughout Chicago, which have resulted in the loss of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transitchicago.com/news/default.aspx?Month=&amp;amp;Year=&amp;amp;Category=2&amp;amp;ArticleId=2558&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nine express routes and over 1,000 transit jobs&lt;/a&gt;, it has become clear that &lt;strong&gt;progress is impossible unless members of the community take control of their transit options.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5203&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Fellow Worker Franklin Rosemont 1943-2009</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4678</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/portraits/Franklin Rosemont/franklin.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Franklin Rosemont, celebrated poet, artist, historian, street speaker,
and surrealist activist, died Sunday, April 12 in Chicago. 
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He was 65 years old. With his partner and comrade, Penelope Rosemont, and lifelong friend Paul Garon, he co-founded the &lt;span class=&quot;ext&quot;&gt;Chicago Surrealist Group&lt;/span&gt;,
an enduring and adventuresome collection of characters that would make
the city a center for the reemergence of that movement of artistic and
political revolt. Over the course of the following four decades,
Franklin and his Chicago comrades produced a body of work, of
declarations, manifestos, poetry, collage, hidden histories, and other
interventions that has, without doubt, inspired an entirely new
generation of revolution in the service of the marvelous. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Franklin Rosemont was born in Chicago on October 2, 1943 to two of
the area’s more significant rank-and-file labor activists, the printer
Henry Rosemont and the jazz musician Sally Rosemont. Dropping out of
Maywood schools after his third year of high school (and instead
spending countless hours in the Art Institute of Chicago’s library
learning about surrealism), he managed nonetheless to enter Roosevelt
University in 1962. Already radicalized through family tradition, and
his own investigation of political comics, the Freedom Rides, and the
Cuban Revolution, Franklin was immediately drawn into the stormy
student movement at Roosevelt. 
&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW Member Laid Off By Starbucks After Confronting CEO and Blogging About It - IWW Immediately Hits Starbucks with Legal Action</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4637</link>
 <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
Chicago, IL (03-19-2009)- The Starbucks Coffee Co. informed outspoken union 
member and barista, Joe Tessone, yesterday that it was laying him off, just two 
weeks after he confronted CEO Howard Schultz over the company&#039;s squeezing of 
employees.  Mr. Tessone&#039;s blog post on the encounter entitled, &amp;quot;Howard the 
Coward: The Day My Boss Ran Away&amp;quot; quickly became an Internet hit among fast food 
workers and their supporters (online at: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/en/node/4618&quot;&gt;http://www.iww.org/en/node/4618)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&amp;quot;When I heard Howard Schultz was in town, I knew had to get to the store 
and make my voice heard as a barista and union member,&amp;quot; said Tessone, a 4-year 
veteran of the company with an excellent performance record. &amp;quot;He said he&#039;d speak 
to me after his interview with the Wall Street Journal only to scurry through 
the emergency exit the first chance he got.  I told Schultz that it was time to 
dialogue with union baristas and that too many of us we&#039;re living in poverty but 
he showed nothing but cowardice.&amp;quot;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Shortly after his exchange with Schultz, Tessone was ordered into a 
one-on-one meeting with a Starbucks Regional Director rather than the store 
manager who would normally administer discipline.  The director warned Tessone 
that he was out of compliance with Starbucks&#039; new &amp;quot;Optimal Scheduling&amp;quot; policy 
which pries open baristas&#039; availability to work without guaranteeing any work 
hours.  The problem with the director&#039;s rationale: Tessone&#039;s availability was 
indeed in complete compliance with Optimal Scheduling requirements which are 
laid out in a written policy.  The same rationale was erroneously deployed by 
Tessone&#039;s store manager yesterday when he was laid off.
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Howard the Coward: The Day My Boss Ran Away</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4618</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
by Joe Tessone
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
03/03/09- The time is 8:55 AM, 5
minutes before my alarm clock was supposed to sound I am awoken by a
text message which says that Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO and #1 union
buster, is having a press conference at the Oak and Rush Starbucks
location. I jump out of bed, get dressed, and haul downtown. By the
time I get there, the news cameras are gone. I look around and there he
is sitting behind a merchandise wall in an interview with a few
reporters. I order an Iced Tall Passion Tea… no need for caffeine, I’m
fired up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
My old District Manager is in the cafe
greeting customers and she asks me why I’m there. “Just getting a
drink,” I respond. She then proceeds to make a call on her cell phone,
obviously calling upper management. After I get my beverage, I find a
seat, set my bag down, and I approach him.

 <title>Interview with IWW Bike Messenger Ben Fietz</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4588</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;1.why did you decide to messenger?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;I
guess I decided to messenger for the same reason as most. I was living
in New Orleans at the time, and was about to lose my job. One day I was
hanging out downtown trying to figure out what to do with myself. A
bike messenger cut through an intersection, and I thought to myself
“that looks like a pretty cool job.” I went down to the only company
that was hiring, and started working the next day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2.when did you start?  has the time been on/off or straight?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>VICTORY AT REPUBLIC WINDOWS AND DOORS! </title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4498</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Press Release from UE Local 1110, posted in solidarity by IWW members:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Workers Vote to Get Pay; Occupation Ends! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After 6 days occupying the 
plant, workers at Republic Window and Doors in Chicago voted to accept a 
settlement late on December 10th. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The settlement totals $1.75million. It 
will provide the workers with: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Eight weeks of pay they are owed under 
the federal WARN Act; &lt;br /&gt;
- Two months of continued health coverage, and; &lt;br /&gt;
- 
Pay for all accrued and unused vacation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
JPMorgan Chase will provide 
$400,000 of the settlement, with the balance coming from Bank of America. 
Although the money will be provided as a loan to Republic Windows and Doors, it 
will go directly into a third-party fund whose sole purpose is to pay the 
workers what is owed them. In addition, the UE has started the &amp;quot;Window of 
Opportunity Fund&amp;quot; dedicated to re-opening the plant. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the Local 1110 
leaders characterized the settlement, &amp;quot;We fought to make them pay what they owe 
us, and we won.&amp;quot; Read more about the settlement here. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We want to extend 
a big THANK YOU to all of you who participated in this campaign. The tremendous 
support and solidarity from the thousands of people like you around the country 
- and the world - who took the time to send messages to Bank of America and who 
rallied at banks across the country was crucial in winning this victory. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is truly an historic victory for workers in the United States. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But this struggle is just the beginning! As the economic crisis deepens 
we need to launch a working class fight back. Rallies for a &amp;quot;People&#039;s Bailout&amp;quot; 
will continue today and throughout the rest of the week. &lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Support Swells for Chicago Union Workers&#039; Factory Occupation</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4492</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/photos/color/events/1b-12-6-08cag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; height=&quot;147&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chicago.indymedia.org/feature/display/70353.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;From Chicago Indymedia&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The worker occupation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.republicwindows.com/&quot;&gt;Republic Windows and Doors&lt;/a&gt; factory on Chicago&#039;s Goose Island by members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ueunion.org/&quot;&gt;UE&lt;/a&gt;
(United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America) Local 1110
went into its third day on Sunday, and workers have vowed to continue
the occupation until they are paid back pay and benefits, or until the
plant is re-opened. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The occupation was declared on
Friday, the day the company moved to shutter the plant with only three
days notice — in violation of federal and state labor laws. Owners have
also cut off employees&#039; insurance and failed to pay back pay. The
takeover has sparked a groundswell of support across the nation, with
rallies, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/bankofamerica/&quot;&gt;e-mail campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/84885.php&quot;&gt;petition drives&lt;/a&gt;, fundraisers and plans for future actions. [ &lt;a href=&quot;http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/84882.php&quot;&gt;Updated news links&lt;/a&gt; ] &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Company management blames the shut-down on Bank of America, which cut
their credit line — after BoA received $25 billion in federal bailout
money that the bank said they did not need. Since the bailout began,
BoA — like big banks across the globe — has slashed credit lines to
businesses, forcing a growing number of small and medium-sized
companies to shut down. Workers plan to meet with company and bank
representatives on Monday — and to picket BoA&#039;s LaSalle St. offices on
Tuesday if Republic&#039;s line of credit is not restored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The action at Republic Windows comes on the heels of a drive to kick
out the company union, which had colluded with company owners and
management for years. That effort succeeded after three years of
struggle. Republic Windows&#039; worker occupation is one of the first
actions of its kind in the United States since the Great Depression,
when a wave of sit-in strikes and factory occupations marked one of the
most militant phases in U.S. labor history.
