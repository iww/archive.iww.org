At the peak of the event 25 demonstrators were in attendance and approximately 30 people attended all together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three years after the founding of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union, the organization has members in multiple U.S states successfully using Direct Action to rise out of poverty and articulate an independent voice on the job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To silence worker voices, Starbucks has disgracefully terminated eight SWU baristas in retaliation for their union activity. The SWU has prevailed against Starbucks to reinstate two of the members but six&lt;br /&gt; remain out of a job. Despite multiple Labor Board complaints, the coffee giant continues to punish baristas for discussing the union and relentlessly forces union-busting propaganda down workers throats. Starbucks must understand that working people of conscience will not allow this affront to the dignity&lt;br /&gt; of our class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3432&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
