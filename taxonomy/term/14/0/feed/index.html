 <title>IWW Stands in Solidarity with Resistance to Dakota Access Pipeline</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-stands-solidarity-resistance-dakota-access-pipeline</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the elected delegates to the 2016 IWW Convention - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.iww.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, September 3, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://ecology.iww.org/images/IWWNoDapl1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The international convention of the Industrial Workers of the World just unanimously voted in favor of an &amp;ldquo;Emergency Resolution&amp;rdquo; in solidarity with the resistance against the Dakota Access Pipeline!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the introduction the Chair of the convention acknowledged that the convention is being held on Ohlone land. We also strongly encouraged workers to organize solidarity actions, travel to Standing Rock, and materially support the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Workers of the World stands in solidarity with the resistance against the Dakota Access Pipeline. We call on the labor movement and working class to take a stand against environmental racism and join the fight for a just transition as our collective future is at stake. We recognize that the capitalist system that oppresses the working class has always oppressed indigenous people of the World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we feel that settlers and indigenous workers should unite to take direct action against colonial industrial capitalism and do everything in our power to restore justice to indigenous people and Mother Earth. An injury to one is an injury to all! &lt;strong&gt;#nodapl #sacredstonespiritcamp #redwarriorcamp #waterislife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>An Open Letter to the Labor Movement: Stand in Solidarity With #NoDAPL</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/open-letter-labor-movement-stand-solidarity-nodapl</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;September 4, 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&#039;s Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;This appeal has been updated to address the attack on the demonstrators were attacked by private security led dogs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://ecology.iww.org/images/IWWNoDapl1.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;Fellow Workers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve not read or seen the news about the &lt;strong&gt;Dakota Access Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;, and the vast and growing opposition to it (#NoDAPL) by now, you&#039;ve not been paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/09/02/among-the-pipeline-fighters-in-central-iowa/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One Account&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Beneath the cover of the endless presidential election season, which in Iowa started a year and a half ago, the Texas-based company Dakota Access LLC (a division of the corporation Energy Transfer Partners [ETP]) has moved methodically ahead with its plan to build this ugly, winding, and ecocidal tube of death. The $4 billion, 1134-mile project would carry 540,000 barrels of largely fracked crude oil from North Dakota’s “Bakken oil patch” daily on a diagonal course through South Dakota, a Sioux Indian burial ground,18 Iowa counties, and a Native American reservation to Patoka, Illinois. It will link with another pipeline that will transport the black gold to terminals and refineries along the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, several thousand indigenous tribal members (supported by over 160 tribes), land owners, environmentalists, climate justice activists, and supporters of #BlackLivesMatter have gathered together into two camps in rural North Dakota to organize nonviolent resistance to this massive project which will parallel and match the length of the infamous (but rejected by Presidential order) Keystone XL pipeline.&amp;nbsp; Several others have been protesting all along the pipeline&#039;s route over the past couple of weeks. These 1000s strong intrepid folks are supported nationally and internationally by 100,000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders in this effort have done all they can working &quot;within the system&quot; to oppose this project &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/09/02/among-the-pipeline-fighters-in-central-iowa/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to no avail&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Anti-pipeline activists have been playing by all the official local, state, and federal rules. They’ve gone through the established channels of law and procedure. They’ve worked the legal and regulatory machinery to the point of exhaustion. They’ve gone through all available avenues of reason and petition. They’ve written and delivered carefully worded petitions and given polite, fact-filled testimony to all the relevant public bodies. They’ve appealed to the IUB. They’ve appealed to the Army Corps of Engineers and to numerous other federal agencies and offices including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Advisory on Historic Preservation, and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. They’ve sued in court, defending farmers’ traditional American-as-apple-pie private property rights...And it’s all been for naught because the state is stuck in the deep pockets of Big Carbon. Last week a long-awaited district court ruling in Des Moines gave DA, ETP, Enbridge, and Marathon and their big financial backers what they wanted. DA is free to complete construction on fifteen parcels where the farm owners had challenged the state’s right to enforce eminent domain on behalf of the Bakken snake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project would represent a disaster for the world&#039;s climate. Already humanity is experiencing a climate emergency--as the increase in the Earth&#039;s average overall surface temperature has surpassed 1°C--brought on by fossil fuel capitalism. Every sensible scientific peer reviewed study dictates that in order to avoid the destruction of the ability of humanity (and much else living) to survive on our planet, the global increase must reach no higher than 2°C, &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt; (and most agree that an increase beyond 1.5°C would be bad enough). In order to do this, at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; 80% of the known fossil fuel &quot;reserves&quot; must remain in the ground. This pipeline would make that prospect increasingly difficult, because it is designed to facilitate the continuing extraction of the Bakken Shale in North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse than that, this pipeline represents the further colonization of indigenous lands, particularly that which lie adjacent to or solidly within the path of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is necessary. Studies show that all of the world&#039;s energy needs can be met by a combination of conservation, 100% renewable energy generation--which is entirely feasible using existing technology, and a reordering of the world&#039;s economic systems to facilitate production for need, not profit. The 100,000s of people who oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline understand this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of this massive opposition however, one group, in particular, has remained disturbingly silent, and that&#039;s labor unions.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Chevron: Actively preventing a transition to renewable energy.</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/chevron-actively-preventing-transition-renewable-energy</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By x363464 - May 16, 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The views expressed here are not the official  position of the IWW (or even the IWW&amp;rsquo;s EUC) and do not necessarily  represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWWEUC_0.jpg&quot; /&gt;In 1950, Chevron, General Motors, and Firestone were charged and convicted of criminal conspiracy for their part in the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy&quot;&gt;General Motors streetcar conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;. In this scandal they purchased streetcar systems all over the United States in order to disassemble the industry and create bus lines. They did this to increase the demand for petroleum, automobiles and tires so that they could directly receive business and profits from their scheme. &amp;nbsp;Later Chevron began investing in alternative industries such as lithium car batteries. Chevron began to be limiting access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses. Many suspect they did this to remove a competitor to gasoline and suspicions were affirmed when Chevron began a lawsuit against &lt;a style=&quot;text-decoration:

 <title>Trailer Park Evicted to Make Room for Fracking</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/trailer-park-evicted-make-room-fracking</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The following campaign involved members of the IWW and Earth First!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/06/pa-fracking-eviction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;By Xian Chiang-Waren - &lt;i&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/i&gt; June 22, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the 32 families of the Riverdale Mobile Home Park in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania, found out that they were losing their homes to the state&#039;s latest fracking operation, the news didn&#039;t come from their landlord, or an eviction notice in the mail&amp;mdash;they read about it in their morning paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The February 18 article, published in the &lt;i&gt;Williamsport Sun-Gazette&lt;/i&gt;, nonchalantly detailed the approval of three natural gas projects in Lycoming County, PA, including a water withdrawal station that would pipe millions of gallons of water from the Susquehanna River to fracking stations in the mountains further north. The article noted that an &amp;quot;added benefit&amp;quot; of the plans was &amp;quot;the removal of mobile homes,&amp;quot; which were located in a potential flood plain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that afternoon, Riverdale&#039;s landlord came by and confirmed what residents had already read in the paper: The property had been sold to Aqua America, a water company dedicated to fracking. The full magnitude of the blow came days later, when the eviction notices arrived, informing the residents that they had until May 1 to relocate so that work on the site could begin in June. Each family was offered $2,500 if they got off the property by April 1; $1,500 if they moved by May 1; and zero compensation after that. It wasn&#039;t nearly enough; lawyers for Riverdale residents later estimated that the cost of moving each trailer was, on average, between $8,000 to $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For communities on the Rust Belt, it&#039;s one of the oldest stories in the book: A new industry comes in and needs to build roadways or pipelines, and poor communities have to get out of its way. &amp;quot;This happens all the time in Pennsylvania,&amp;quot; said Alex Lotorto, a Pennsylvania activist and delegate for the union group Industrial Workers of the World. &amp;quot;Industry comes in and uses our skilled labor. Then both government and industry end up abusing us because honestly, nobody even thinks about the people north of I-80.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Riverdale, something unexpected happened: People decided they weren&#039;t going to go quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
