 <title>Maersk workers in the ports of Tacoma &amp; Olympia wildcat, demand union representation with the solidarity of SDS / IWW members</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3759</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/IU510/images/donotscab1.jpg&quot; /&gt;MAERSK STRIKE! -- PORT OF TACOMA - By Acumensch&lt;span class=&quot;yshortcuts&quot;&gt;, from YouTube&lt;/span&gt; - November  8, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRKOYrE8XUo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube. com/watch?  v=DRKOYrE8XUo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unannounced wildcat strike was called to push the  administration of Maersk (headquarters in Tacoma) to allow union workers to  join the union of their choice instead of the union the company requires them  to be members of,Securitas, which doesn&#039;t provide or bargain for workers&#039;  basic needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAERSK UNION STRIKE IN &lt;span class=&quot;yshortcuts&quot;&gt;TACOMA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - By  Tacoma SDS, Indymedia- November 8, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seattle.indymedia.org/en/2007/11/262632.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://seattle. indymedia. org/en/2007/ 11/262632.  shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unannounced wildcat strike was called to push the  administration of Maersk (headquarters in Tacoma) to allow union workers to  join the union of their choice instead of the union the company requires them  to be members of, Securitas, which doesn&#039;t provide or bargain for workers&#039;  basic needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strike at the Port of Tacoma yesterday was  unannounced publicly, to catch the company off-guard and to require an  arbitrator from the longshoremens&#039; union (ILWU) to come to the port and  declare the picket line the Maersk workers staged was unsafe to cross. Jobs  With Justice organized the strike. Tacoma SDS and other community members who  heard about it went to the port to show solidarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maersk is the  largest shipping company in the world, Adam Hoyt said. Its North American  headquarters are located in &lt;span class=&quot;yshortcuts&quot;&gt;Tacoma&lt;/span&gt;.  The workers are not granted basic needs that other union workers are, such as  a pension plan. Workers are forced to join the Securitas union which is acts  as a pacifier to the union workers. Maersk has tried its hardest to convince  workers Securitas is a good union, and that other unions are  dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tacoma P.D. singled out Tacoma SDS members and asked for  identification and phone numbers. There were no physical confrontations, but  our group felt it was unfair and absurd that officers would single out SDS  without any reasonable suspicion. They asked us if we were attending the  Smash Tacoma ICE protest, trying to glean information about it. We told them  we would not consent to any of their questions or searches. Officer&lt;span class=&quot;yshortcuts&quot;&gt; Darlington&lt;/span&gt;  said the port has been the site of conspiracies to conduct&lt;br /&gt;terrorism. &amp;quot;People  ride jetskis next to tankers and then they speed off in the other direction,&amp;quot;  he said. Tacoma SDS was not convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Editor&#039;s note: some of the members of SDS are also members of the IWW&lt;/em&gt;). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>NW Leonard Peltier March Report</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2052</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/portraits/others/peltier.jpg&quot; /&gt;SACRIFICE: REPORT ON OUR EVENT&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 13th ANNUAL NORTHWEST REGIONAL INTERNATIONAL DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH LEONARD PELTIER MARCH. RALLY AND AFTER RALLY GET TOGETHER FOR JUSTICE SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2006, TACOMA&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are a lot of nights I lie in my cell and I cannot understand why this hell and this terror I have been going through for 21 years (30 years now) hasn&amp;rsquo;t ended. But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay a sacrifice to make things better for our people. The sacrifice I have made, when I really sit down to think about it, is nothing compared to what our people of 100 years ago, or 50 years ago or 25 years ago made. Some gave their lives. Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms. So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those. I have gone too far now to start backing down. I don&amp;rsquo;t give up, not until my people are free will I give up. If I have to sacrifice some more then I sacrifice some more.&amp;rdquo; Leonard Peltier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2052&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
