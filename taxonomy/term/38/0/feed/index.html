 <title>IWW Member Isn&#039;t Toying Around with Wagner Rights</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-member-isnt-toying-around-wagner-rights</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Grand Junction, CO- After months of organizing and radical action in the anti-worker state of Colorado, the hammer of injustice finally fell for one Industrial Worker of the World member.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; Josh Carmona, IWW member and anarchist agitator on the Western Slope, was terminated from Toys For the Fun of It, Tuesday, for organizing his workplace. Although the official explanation that he was losing customers because of his involvement at a Romney/Ryan rally weeks earlier; Josh believes that this is just a coverup for his boss&#039; wobbliephobia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; After a quick call to his delegate, John (4 Corners IWW), action was decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unfair labor practice charge was filed with the National Labor Relations board.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An unemployment claim is being filed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; This Saturday, Nov. 10th, 2012, a call-in action is planned for the anti-worker toy store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST please call or email complaints to the store letting them know what you think of worker reprisal and unfair labor practices.&lt;br /&gt;

 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/demand-paid-sick-days</link>
 <description>&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/x351964-3en.jpg&quot; /&gt;*&amp;nbsp;PAID SICK DAYS NOW! *&amp;nbsp;RALLY AT HOLLADAY PARK * SATURDAY, OCTOBER 6, 4PM *NE MULTNOMAH &amp;amp; 13TH AVE *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email: paidsickdaysnow [at] gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone: 971-266-1891&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday, October 6, 2012 4pm, at Holladay Park, the Portland Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World and the IWW&amp;rsquo;s Food &amp;amp; Retail Workers United will hold a rally as part of a campaign to win paid sick days for all workers in Portland, Oregon. This event is sponsored by Laborers 483, American Friends Service Committee, We Are Oregon, Portland Jobs with Justice, Portland Central American Solidarity Committee, Portland Restaurant Workers Association, and the International Socialist Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featured at the rally will be speakers and musical acts, including Mic Crenshaw, The Crossettes, and I Wobble Wobble, as well as worker testimonies and opportunities to learn more about the campaign and get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally officially kicks off our campaign, which is founded on the following mission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the workers of Portland, acting in solidarity across industries, seek to improve the health and well-being of our fellow workers, families and communities. Therefore we demand that all employers within Portland provide all employees -- whether full-time, part-time or temporary -- with paid sick and safe days commensurate with hours worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Five Point Demand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;1. All of us -- full time, part time and temporary workers -- deserve paid sick and safe days to care for ourselves and our families as members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;2. We call on all employers to provide paid sick and safe days immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;3. We need paid sick and safe days to care for our own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● illness, which includes physical and mental health issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● injury&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● preventative care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● safety when experiencing domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● and bereavement for our family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;We -- as caregivers, parents, and partners -- need paid sick days to care for our:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● spouses &amp;amp; domestic partners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● biological, foster, or adopted children, stepchildren, and children of domestic partners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;● and other family members under our care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;4. Employers will implement a standard accrual rate of paid sick and safe days for all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;employees. The rate must be compassionate to the need of workers to care for both ourselves and our families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot;&gt;5. Employers will not interfere, discriminate, or retaliate against our request for or use of paid sick and safe days to care for ourselves and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot wait until it&amp;rsquo;s politically convenient for paid sick &amp;amp; safe days. A grassroots campaign led by the workers, families and communities who are most affected by the lack of paid sick days is a necessity to ensure we acquire a policy which meets our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call upon all workers and community allies interested in learning more and participating in our campaign to attend the rally on October 6 in Holladay Park!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An illness to one is contagious to all!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW shop in Portland needs your help!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-shop-portland-needs-your-help</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Ryan G&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings IWW members,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a call for union members to help out an IWW shop in Portland, OR, the Red &amp;amp; Black Cafe. &amp;nbsp;Last evening, someone threw a brick through one of the cafe windows with a hate message attached. &amp;nbsp;Our fellow workers at the cafe, which is collectively owned and operated (and an IWW closed shop) need financial assistance in order to get the window replaced as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please visit the cafe website at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redandblackcafe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.redandblackcafe.com/&lt;/a&gt;, where you can make a PayPal donation. &amp;nbsp;Donations by check can be mailed to the cafe at 400 SE 12th Ave., Portland, OR 97214.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This union shop, which is a long time gathering point for the IWW in Portland, has been subjected to several acts of vandalism this year from unknown individuals. &amp;nbsp;The cafe is a gathering space for unionists, anti-capitalists, and the radical community at large in the Portland area. &amp;nbsp;We could use your help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In solidarity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland IWW / IWW General Executive Board / Red&amp;amp;Black Cafe worker&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW General Defense Committee Statement against AFTRA members in Target&#039;s anti-union Video</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-general-defense-committee-statement-against-aftra-members-targets-anti-union-video</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img vspace=&quot;3&quot; hspace=&quot;3&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/jurisdictional_picket1.preview.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; /&gt;The news website Gawker.com recently released for public viewing a copy of Target&#039;s antiunion propaganda video. Filled with scary tales of those terrifying union organizers and how they&#039;re out for your money, it was a typically low-budget production and we frankly give it two thumbs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do take incredible exception to is that this anti-union propaganda video was a union job,starring two members of AFTRA, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Ric Reitz and Nicky Buggs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We find it simply abhorent that anyone at all would, under the jurisdiction of their union, portray such capitalist, anti-worker swill and be fine collecting a paycheck. Ric Reitz offered an explanation typical of that drilled into too many workers by the pro-boss business unions under the AFL-CIO: &amp;quot;If someone hires me to play a rapist, does it make me a rapist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take the job, and you&#039;re an actor,&amp;quot; says Reitz, a longtime member of AFTRA and the Screen Actors Guild. &amp;quot;Am I pro-union? Absolutely.&amp;quot; To which we ask, &amp;quot;Would you take a job playing a rapist in a video intended to promote rape?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/iww-general-defense-committee-statement-against-aftra-members-targets-anti-union-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>IWW Members Mobilize Outreach to Starbucks Baristas on MLK Day Nationwide</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5325</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;On Monday, January 17, 2011, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, while baristas at the Astor Place Starbucks in Manhattan were declaring their membership in the IWW, members of the IWW and supporters descended on Starbucks throughout the United States to wish baristas a happy Martin Luther King day.  As part of these greetings, IWW organizers informed baristas of the recent victory won by IWW Starbucks baristas in securing time-and-one-half holiday premium for working on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The victory came after a spirited three-year initiative of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) which made public the company&#039;s second-class treatment of Dr. King&#039;s birthday and called on the coffee giant to pay the same premium that it pays workers on six other federal holidays. After Starbucks refused to change its policy, union workers and their supporters launched a determined campaign of grassroots actions in Starbucks stores and communities all across the country in support of equal treatment for MLK Day. (For more information, see related article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iww.org/en/node/5270&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Starbucks Baristas Win Equal Treatment for MLK Day After Three Year Union Fight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IWW members visited Starbucks and talked with baristas in hundreds of cities throughout the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the effort was a huge success.  Workers were positive and appreciative, and it shows that solidarity unionism and international solidarity is still a very effective strategy.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Workers of the World union effort at Starbucks is the first time a labor organization in the United States has succeeded in building a base of organized baristas at the company. With over 300 worker-organizers across the country and growing, the SWU has consistently chalked up victories at Starbucks including across-the-board raises, more secure work hours, and respectful treatment from previously abusive managers whose conduct improved due to union pressure campaigns. The SWU has repeatedly prevailed against Starbucks in the legal arena across multiple cities including in a lengthy New York City trial over pervasive illegal union-busting, the first time the company had to square off against baristas in open court regarding unfair labor practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IWW Starbucks campaign is just beginning. If you are a barista at Starbucks, or if you are a worker at any unorganized workplace, including especially a major chain or fastfood franchise, we want to hear from you.

 <title>Breaking:  Baristas at the Largest Starbucks in New York City (Astor Place) Honor MLK by Joining the IWW Starbucks Union</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5322</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Starbucks Workers Union (Industrial Workers of the World).  Contact: Zelig Stern, 508-524-2118; Cason Bolton, Jr, 702-490-1732&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/SbuxAstorsm.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;NEW YORK, NY –On this the 25th anniversary of Dr. King’s holiday, baristas at the Astor Place Starbucks in Manhattan declared their membership in the 105 year old union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a staunch and outspoken defender of workers’ rights including the right to a living wage and the right to join a labor union.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The baristas represent the latest group of workers at the coffee giant to join the ongoing struggle for a living wage, more consistent scheduling, more affordable health insurance, and to be treated with basic respect and dignity by management.  “I am proud to join the growing ranks of retail workers organizing together in the largest and least organized sector of our economy and at a company that has created thousands of low-wage jobs,” expressed Astor Place barista Zelig Stern.  In the last year, baristas in Omaha, Nebraska and Ft. Worth, Texas have also joined the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU), showing that workers’ concerns with the company are far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We would just like to be treated like human beings and not machines,” said union barista and Astor Place employee Cason Bolton, Jr. in reference to Starbucks’ latest initiative toward mimicking the factory assembly-line, the “Beverage Repeatable Routine.”&lt;/p&gt;     

&lt;p&gt;Today the workers delivered a collectively written demand letter (see below) to the management of the Astor Place Starbucks.  Their demands included a one dollar per an hour raise across the board for all store employees.  While the company’s total net revenue for FY 2010 increased by 9.5% to $10.7 billion, according to the company’s Financial Report for Nov. 4, 2010, many of the retail location employees aren’t able to make ends meet with their low Starbucks wages and are forced to live below the poverty line, many requiring public assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5322&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Starbucks Baristas Win Equal Treatment for MLK Day After Three Year Union Fight</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5270</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Employees that Work on Dr. King&#039;s Holiday will Receive Time-and-One-Half Holiday Pay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/memphis_king.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;November 18, 2010 - Contact: Aaron Kocher, 612-220-6454&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York, NY- Starbucks baristas across the United States for the first time next year will begin receiving a time-and-one-half holiday premium for working on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  The move comes after a spirited three-year initiative of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) which made public the company&#039;s second-class treatment of Dr. King&#039;s birthday and called on the coffee giant to pay the same premium that it pays workers on six other federal holidays.  After Starbucks refused to change its policy, union workers and their supporters launched a determined campaign of grassroots actions in Starbucks stores and communities all across the country in support of equal treatment for MLK Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks Union members say this is an especially emotional victory, given that the SWU has long-cited the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a major inspiration.  Dr. King, who was assassinated in Memphis while supporting the effort of striking sanitation workers to form a union, was a staunch and outspoken defender of workers&#039; rights including the right to a living wage and the right to join a labor union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&#039;re deeply moved to have been able in our modest way to increase respect for Dr. King&#039;s legacy while ensuring that Starbucks employees who work on his holiday are fairly compensated,&quot; said Anja Witek, a Starbucks barista and SWU member in Minnesota.  &quot;This is a great example of what baristas and all low-wage workers can achieve by getting organized and taking direct action in support of workplace justice issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Starbucks claims to &#039;embrace diversity&#039;, it doggedly resisted the SWU&#039;s call for equal treatment of MLK Day for three years.  The company based its refusal on the claim that its holiday policy was in line with the (abysmally low) standards of the food service sector.  The SWU made the case that Starbucks&#039; commitment to diversity was illusory, citing the disproportionate number of workers of color in the lowest-paid positions in the company and its intense exploitation of coffee farmers including the Ethiopian workers who grew some of Starbucks&#039; most expensive beans but received just 2.2% of the retail price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5270&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Urgent Action! - PHONE ZAP IN SUPPORT OF FIRED NYC UNION BARISTA</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5211</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) union barista Jeffrey W. Bauer was wrongfully fired for organizing at Ozzie&#039;s Coffee &amp; Tea in New York City on June 29th, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NYC IWW has been engaged in a fight for justice for Fellow Worker Jeff Bauer, both through Direct Action and filing Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PHONE ZAP General Store Manager, Rafael at both Ozzie&#039;s locations!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, September 30th. Noon to 5 pm EST call (718) 768-6868 ask for Rafael or available manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday, October 1st. 10 am to 3 pm EST call (718) 398-6695 Ask for Rafael, Melissa or available manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1. Union barista Jeff Bauer be immediately reinstated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2. Ozzie&#039;s treat their employees with respect and obey Federal Labor Laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3. Stop lying about Jeff Bauer&#039;s work ethic to the NLRB and the media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IWW union barista Jeff Bauer worked at Ozzie&#039;s for over a year and proved himself to be a hard worker with a strong work ethic. The quality of his labor was never questioned before his union affiliation was leaked to management. In fact, Jeff was offered the General Store Manager position before it was given to Rafael, but turned it down on principal as it went against his political beliefs as both an anarchist and a unionist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;MINNEAPOLIS - Jimmy John&#039;s franchise owners Mike and Rob Mulligan awoke to an unpleasant surprise last week as employees disrupted construction of the newest store in the chain with picket lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picketing sandwich workers appealed to members of Minneapolis building trades unions working on the new store to down their tools until the Mulligans agree to meet with the newly-formed Jimmy Johns Workers Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If Mike and Rob Mulligan have $300,000 to open another Jimmy Johns, then they have the money to meet our demands for a decent wage, consistent hours, and basic fairness at work. If they&#039;re not going to meet with us, then we have no choice but to hit them where it hurts. We are happy with the outcome of today&#039;s action– construction at the site was delayed for about an hour,” said Davis Ritsema, a member of the union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most construction workers employed under a union contract in Minnesota have the right to refuse to cross picket lines. Under Minnesota state law, motor vehicles are required to come to a complete stop at picket lines so that picketers can appeal to the driver not to cross the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is the first fast food union in the nation, and is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/5185&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Take Action to Defend IWW Baristas in Omaha!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/5182</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Since Starbucks baristas at the 15th and Douglas store in Omaha announced their membership in the IWW one month ago, Starbucks has unleashed an aggressive union busting campaign on the workers with a particularly extreme effort to intimidate and threaten FW Tyler Swain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this, all members of the Omaha SWU have voted unanimously to send out an appeal for solidarity to the broader IWW and labor movement. Please show Starbucks that an injury to one is an injury to all by taking the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Call Partner Resources Representative Shari Rugi, (314)607-4180&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shari Rugi is coordinating a campaign of intimidation and harassment against union members at the 15th and Douglas Starbucks. This intimidation has included fabrication of sexual harassment allegations and interrogation of union members at the store over these accusations concocted by management. Furthermore, Shari Rugi as directed the store manager at 15th and Douglas, Missy Kemp, to tighten policy and increase disciplinary actions against workers, in particular against FW Tyler Swain. Rugi has forced Store Manager Missy Kemp to write up FW Tyler Swain twice since going public for alleged violations of policy, contriving allegations of insubordination, and illegally tightening the time and attendance policy. weeks after these alleged violations have occurred. Union members at the 15th and Douglas location have, on multiple occasions, overheard conversations taking place between the store manager, Missy Kemp, and the partner resource manager, Shari Rugi, in which she has insisted FW Swain be written up for these alleged infractions, regardless of the store managers opinion of the events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s time to let Shari Rugi know that we as an organization will not tolerate the unfair and discriminatory treatment of public union members, and that we, as a global organization are well aware of her actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Call District Manager Jennifer Rojas, (402)319-2760&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The District Manager has repeatedly disrespected workers in her area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based upon this level of disrespect, the final demand in the letter presented to management, including the 15th and Douglas store manager Missy Kemp, district manager Jennifer Rojas, and Regional Director of Operations Brett Battes, was a request that Jennifer Rojas resign from her position. A month after the delivery no mention of this demand has been made, despite targeted attempts to separate public union members from the company. It&#039;s time to let Jennifer Rojas know that her disrespect to workers in her area does not go unnoticed, and that she needs to be working for noticeable improvements in the working environment she oversees or resign immediately. Specific demands are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the immediate back pay of wages owed to FW Samantha Cole which were promised to her the morning of August 6th in a phone conversation that took place between Jennifer Rojas and Samantha Cole,&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;an open and cooperative dialogue between levels of management and the Starbucks Workers Union,&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;an open environment for members of the union to organize without fear of retaliation,&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;and an increased effort to put into place the district wide 20 percent wage increase that the union is fighting for.&lt;/li&gt;
