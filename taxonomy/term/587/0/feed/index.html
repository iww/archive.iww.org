 <title>New Prisoner Audio Confirms “Humanitarian Crisis” at Stillwater Prison: Prisoners and Families Demand An End to the Lockdown</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Joanna Nu&amp;ntilde;ez - Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, August 10, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/320x196x5-15-1068x654.jpg.pagespeed.ic.7lPE1Hy4_x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;The lockdown at Stillwater Prison is now in its 27th day. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/08/11/stillwater-prison-conditions-complaints/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;families&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/?cat=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prisoners&lt;/a&gt; demand an end to the lockdown the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee is releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1307eAreXim7tDMeLivaqHy1vmJ5DwsaM/view&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt; from inside Stillwater prison to showcase the urgency of the lockdown&amp;rsquo;s immediate end and to expose the lies being spread by the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC). The audio, shared by Stillwater inmate Tony, last name removed due to concerns for retaliation, was received on August 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This audio interview - along with other independent reports from prisoners in Stillwater - document human rights violations, the power of the media&amp;rsquo;s impact in changing conditions inside, and, as Stillwater prisoner Carlos Smith says, that the &amp;ldquo;[DOC] spokesperson is not being truthful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple independent reports from prisoners contradict the claims made by the DOC in an August 10th statement to KSTP. A DOC representative said prisoners are receiving &lt;a href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;showers every 3 days and were given hygiene bags as well as fresh linens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, prisoners report not having received more than three showers in 24 days of being locked down. Nor have Smith or Tony received clean clothes. Smith shared, &amp;ldquo;Our clothes are mildewed because we have only had the chance to wash them once in the last 24 days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions inside Stillwater sound nightmarish. A prisoner who wishes to remain anonymous reports &amp;ldquo;the stench in the units from the garbage is gagging. Fruit flies are abundant and everywhere. Toiletries are not passed out daily. Some days you find yourself having to ask your neighbors for toilet paper... [which] is prohibited&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lockdowns prisoners are supposed to be in cells a brutal twenty three hours a day. Yet Tony reports they were &amp;ldquo;locked in their cells...for 20 days straight&amp;rdquo; without proper medical supervision, and when displaced for searches prisoners were surrounded by staff &amp;ldquo;with automatic weapons and several canines&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prisoner who wishes to remain anonymous says he &amp;ldquo;can&#039;t stand by and allow the DOC to lie to the public, bolstering their own image to request more money off my pain and suffering. I am paying my dues to society and now the DOC&#039;s the one victimizing me for their own personal gain.&amp;rdquo; He asks that &amp;ldquo;[you] report the truth to the public. Open their eyes to our plight and the problem of warehousing over reintegration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some prisoners see progress being forced by stories in the news, including their first hour out of their cells during the day. &amp;ldquo;A lot of change has occurred as people understand what is going on inside the prisons [from the TV]&amp;rdquo; Tony reports. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOC says they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;transitioning off of lockdown&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; but it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;a process without a definitive end date&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Prisoners and their families are not willing to wait. The Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd6AsfZOtpz-ypwvJ03fe5FadjGzSJko0L6V2yI2EM1Ix0sQ/viewform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;circulating a petition&lt;/a&gt; demanding the DOC immediately end the lockdown at Stillwater. IWOC is calling for an emergency meeting this Sunday at 7pm for family and friends of prisoners in Stillwater to end the lockdown. &amp;ldquo;The DOC is preventing prisoners from speaking out so we will do whatever is necessary to make their conditions heard&amp;rdquo;, says Joanna Nu&amp;ntilde;ez of the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>In Wake of Death, Minnesota Prisoners Speak Out</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/wake-death-minnesota-prisoners-speak-out</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, August 10, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/320x196x5-15-1068x654.jpg.pagespeed.ic.7lPE1Hy4_x.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;As the Minnesota Department of Corrections &lt;a href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/department-of-corrections-lockdown-lifted-at-all-minnesota-prisons-except-stillwater/5020877/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ends its lockdown at all prisons except&lt;/a&gt; Stillwater, prisoners there are speaking out against human rights abuses and calling for the lockdown to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Carlos Smith, a prisoner at Stillwater, &amp;ldquo;we are currently without any basic humane treatment here... We still have not received any showers nor are we any closer to seeing any end to this nonsense.&amp;rdquo; Stillwater has been locked down since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/stillwater-inmate-kills-corrections-officer/488544421/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lone prisoner killed a guard&lt;/a&gt; on July 18. When facilities are on lockdown, prisoners receive no more than one hour a day outside their cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith says prisoners are being held hostage in a struggle between the DOC and AFSCME prison guards, some of whom are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/crime-and-courts/4478582-prison-shutters-site-death-stillwater-prison-may-re-purpose-workshop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calling for the resignation of the commissioner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:&amp;#xA;&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,sans-serif;color:black&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the lack of laundry and showers, the 1600 men inside Stillwater are facing humiliation during the lockdown. &amp;ldquo;They took two sections, about sixty of us, handcuffed together, naked. Then we sat like that in the gym for an hour and a half while they ransacked our cells,&amp;rdquo; Smith reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFSCME, the prison guard union is looking for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/crime-and-courts/4478582-prison-shutters-site-death-stillwater-prison-may-re-purpose-workshop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bigger budget for staffing&lt;/a&gt; but David Boehnke of the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe staffing alone will reduce violence. &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t give respect, you won&amp;rsquo;t get it. Overcrowding means reduced programming and inhuman conditions - violence which begets violence,&amp;rdquo; Boehnke says. &amp;ldquo;The solution is there. Release the thousands of people locked up for petty parole violations and reinvest that money into improving conditions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2017 study from California prisons notes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://economics.ucr.edu/job_candidates/Kurzfeld-Paper.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;robust relationship between reducing overcrowding and lowering prison violence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,sans-serif;color:black&quot;&gt;. Minnesota prisons are already above maximum capacity, resulting in hundreds of people being housed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/state-s-prisoners-decry-aimless-limbo-in-county-jails/371865301/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;county jails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,sans-serif;color:black&quot;&gt; while the prison population is projected to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/prison-overcrowding-to-get-worse/371844582/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 1,300 people over maximum capacity by 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;,sans-serif;color:black&quot;&gt;. As of July 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Corrections%20Adult%20Prison%20Population%20Summary%207-1-2018_tcm1089-347924.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;35.6% of Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s prison admissions&lt;/a&gt;, 2771 people, were incarcerated for crimeless &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/user-41909583/stories-from-the-inside-rolling-us-out-and-right-back-in&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technical violations of parole&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the recent killing, both guards and prisoners are facing increasing violence inside Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s prisons. Without changing conditions, it is hard to see an end rising violence. But right now, Smith hopes the public will speak up to end the lockdown and its human rights abuses. &amp;ldquo;We are just sitting in these cells smelling like billy goats,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Want to Stop Violence in Minnesota Prisons? Free Our People</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/want-stop-violence-minnesota-prisons-free-our-people</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By IWOC - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/want-to-stop-violence-in-minnesota-prisons-free-our-people/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s Going Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, July 31, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/5-15-1068x654.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Editorial from the Twin Cities chapter of the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) that links horrific conditions inside with ongoing violence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 18, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/assault-corrections-officer-stillwater-minnesota-department-of-corrections/4993759/&quot;&gt;the first prison guard in Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s history was killed&lt;/a&gt;, on top of recent violence in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.kaaltv.com/news/attacks-assault-oak-parks-prison-rise-officers-police-riot-inmates-sad/4872337/&quot;&gt;Oak Park Heights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/minnesota-inmate-accused-in-guards-death-has-violent-past/ar-AAAisdK&quot;&gt;Stillwater prisons&lt;/a&gt;. Yet all the DOC does is ask for &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/department-corrections-commissioner-tom-roy-plans-request-more-funding-from-legislature-again/5006544/&quot;&gt;more money&lt;/a&gt; on top of their &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/deadly-prison-attack-stillwater-joseph-gomm-minnesota-department-corrections/4996735/&quot;&gt;1.2 billion dollar budget&lt;/a&gt;. We need a new approach to change in Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s prisons. Stop putting money into a violent institution that is not correcting anyone. Free our people, and reinvest savings into reentry and rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who have been incarcerated or in regular contact with Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s prisons, recent violence is not a surprise &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s an inevitability due to the behavior of the prisons system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s prisons have gotten progressively worse. Lip service to rehabilitation has little application to daily realities, while harsher parole practices, sentencing, and increased criminalization of our communities have &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2015/06/minnesota-crime-50-year-low-so-why-are-we-imprisoning-more-people-ever&quot;&gt;manufactured an overcrowding crisis&lt;/a&gt;. And our people are dying. Between 2000-2013,&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/naacpmpls/posts/2083555125298992&quot;&gt; 280 people incarcerated in Minnesota prisons were killed&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; 75% of them due to medical neglect. Yet we spend &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vera.org/publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends-prison-spending&quot;&gt;$41,366 per incarcerated person each year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Many prison guards in Minnesota are racist and abusive. The day before the killing at Stillwater, a prisoner reported that the man killed was telling everyone that &amp;ldquo;guards can do whatever we want to you and you can&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it&amp;rdquo;. Last year the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee released a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/user-41909583/stories-from-the-inside-because-they-have-the-badge&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; just scratching the surface of guard abuse in Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s prisons.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;It is &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2014/apr/15/lowering-recidivism-through-family-communication/&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt;, including by the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://mn.gov/doc/family-visitor/visiting-information/&quot;&gt;MN DOC&lt;/a&gt;, that increased community connection reduces recidivism. Yet the MN DOC regularly prevents mail delivery, makes visiting miserable, and represses prisoner and community attempts to build bridges with each other. Results are predictable: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://justicelab.iserp.columbia.edu/states/Minnesota.html&quot;&gt;48% of people released on parole end up back in prison&lt;/a&gt;, a shocking &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Corrections%20Adult%20Prison%20Population%20Summary%201-1-2018_tcm1089-323881.pdf&quot;&gt;88% of them&lt;/a&gt; for minor &amp;ldquo;technical violations&amp;rdquo; of parole, not new crimes. Even DOC employees are saying &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.inforum.com/news/crime-and-courts/4474871-coworkers-vow-fight-more-staff-minnesota-prison-where-guard-was-killed&quot;&gt;low staffing&lt;/a&gt; in overcrowded conditions are creating extreme dangers for prisoners and staff, while a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://kstp.com/news/deadly-prison-attack-stillwater-joseph-gomm-minnesota-department-corrections/4996735/&quot;&gt;rash of quitting&lt;/a&gt; has followed the recent killing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an easy solution to these violent conditions &amp;ndash; free our people. Instead of putting yet more money into prisons we should immediately release all people in prison for crimeless &amp;ldquo;technical violations&amp;rdquo; of parole and nonviolent crimes, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Corrections%20Adult%20Prison%20Population%20Summary%201-1-2018_tcm1089-323881.pdf&quot;&gt;at least 40% of the population&lt;/a&gt;. Savings should fund successful reentry and rehabilitation programs. The parole system must be changed to ensure everyone has the opportunity to earn a life worth living. &lt;i&gt;(Learn more about &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3hCKJLltmvYVdMGy_g1LZO983Eu7VLzL7ZyK4zhLyosHEkg/viewform&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;this fight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; on Saturday August 25th, 1-3pm in North Minneapolis &amp;ndash; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/11PWiDRkGprkmkV_qEFPd2ZUPVScjDX4D/view&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;flier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/227466424566704/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can conditions be improved without prisoners having real power and community connections. Prisoners should be allowed to form their own unions and represent themselves. Community groups and family members should be welcomed. Visiting hours should be expanded, while mail censorship must end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This August 21st &amp;ndash; September 9th, prisoners around the country are &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://prisonstrike.com/&quot;&gt;going on strike&lt;/a&gt; against inhuman conditions confirmed by prisoners&amp;rsquo; legal status as slaves under the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;13th am&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;endment to the US Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. Will Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s prisons join other systems in regular deadly violence between slaves and their cagers? Or will we treat humans like human beings, stop senseless incarceration, and use savings for rehabilitation and community? We say slavery must end &amp;ndash; free our people!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Fourth Star: The New Junior Wobblies and the Next Generation of Union Militants</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/fourth-star-new-junior-wobblies-and-next-generation-union-militants</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Sadie Farrell and M.K. Lees - &lt;a href=&quot;https://anarchiststudies.org/2017/07/10/the-fourth-star-the-new-junior-wobblies-and-the-next-generation-of-union-militants-by-sadie-farrell-and-m-k-lees/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Institute for Anarchist Studies&lt;/a&gt;, July 10, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several factors played into our collective decision not to run a print issue of &lt;/em&gt;Perspectives on Anarchist Theory&lt;em&gt; for the current year. We sincerely thank all inquiries and submissions sent for what was hoped to be an issue on Play. A call out for submissions for a Beyond The Crisis print issue of &lt;/em&gt;Perspectives&lt;em&gt; (2018) will be announced shortly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an article written by two Wobblies in response to our call for Play essays. These organizers bridge the gap between play and the practice of organizing skills via educational skits and fun activities led by the New Junior Wobblies, the young members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The IWW globe logo holds three stars representing Education, Organization and Emancipation.&amp;nbsp;This article looks at Recreation &amp;ndash; a &amp;nbsp;fourth star &amp;ndash; from challenging uneven relations of power, to making joy central to organizing against capitalism,&amp;nbsp;regardless of age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after a wave of government repression and internal splits nearly destroyed the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as a functioning labor organization, a group of Wobblies felt the immediate need to find new ways to raise the next generation of revolutionary unionists.&amp;nbsp; As a part of solidarity support for striking IWW coal miners in Colorado, children of union members were invited to join an IWW organization of their own.&amp;nbsp; These Wobbly kids formed &amp;ldquo;locals&amp;rdquo; to organize support for their striking parents, and alongside them, develop a rudimentary understanding of the world and how they might soon be a part of organizing to change it.&amp;nbsp; To the IWW tripartite motto, &amp;ldquo;Education, Organization, Emancipation&amp;rdquo; they added &amp;ldquo;Recreation,&amp;rdquo; and in 1927, the Junior Wobblies Union was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effort to formally carve out a space for children in the IWW was lost as the union fell into obscurity, but with the IWW revival of the past few decades, old traditions have been revived.&amp;nbsp; In 2011, the Twin Cities branch of the IWW reconstituted both the self-educational institution, the Work People&amp;rsquo;s College, as well as the Junior Wobblies.&amp;nbsp; It began as a combination of IWW members coordinating childcare to enable parents to attend trainings, panels, and other IWW events.&amp;nbsp; But as the network of Wobblies with kids grew, so did the desire to provide concrete ways for kids to engage with union activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, 2012, the Twin Cities put on the first Junior Wobblies summer camp in decades, hosting IWW children ages 2 through 12 at Mesaba Park campground for a week of games, outdoor play, and structured learning activities.&amp;nbsp; The camp has continued annually ever since, drawing a larger crowd from across the US and Canada each year.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Militant Tactics in Anti-Fascist Organizing--Interview Transcript</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/militant-tactics-anti-fascist-organizing-interview-transcript</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Matthew N Lyons - &lt;a href=&quot;http://threewayfight.blogspot.com/2017/04/militant-tactics-in-anti-fascist.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Way Fight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, April 26, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/Rev-Antifa-Unionism-GDC.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This interview with longtime anti-fascist activist Kieran (who was one of the founders of Three Way Fight thirteen years ago) covers a wide range of topics: from the work of Anti-Racist Action in the 1980s and 90s to the IWW&amp;rsquo;s General Defense Committee today, from the politics of wearing masks to the dangers of relying on the state for protection, and from engaging organized labor to building community-based self-defense against the far right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; The interview was conducted for KPFA Radio&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://kpfa.org/program/against-the-grain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Against the Grain&lt;/a&gt; by the program&amp;rsquo;s co-producer Sasha Lilley and was broadcast on February 14, 2017. The audio recording is available for download or online listening &lt;a href=&quot;https://kpfa.org/episode/against-the-grain-february-14-2017/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The following transcription, by Clarissa Rogers, appears with the permission of Against the Grain and the participants.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kieran was one of the founders of Anti-Racist Action, a youth-based direct action movement that organized against Nazi skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan, and the white power music scene from the 1980s to the 2000s. He&amp;rsquo;s now chief steward in a local union of telecom workers and is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World&amp;rsquo;s General Defense Committee, which has taken on anti-fascist work in a number of cities. In late January, a member of the General Defense Committee of the IWW was shot at a Milo Yiannopoulos event in Seattle. Against the Grain, a program of radical ideas originating from KPFA Radio, spoke with him after demonstrators closed down Yiannapoulous&amp;rsquo; event at UC Berkeley on February 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ATG:&lt;/b&gt; Kieran, many liberals and leftists believe that the right of free speech is paramount. As you know, protestors using militant tactics shut down a Milo Yiannopoulos event at UC Berkeley, which is the home of the Free Speech Movement. Why don&amp;rsquo;t you think that the right of free speech should be extended to fascists and the far right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kieran:&lt;/b&gt; There are a couple points to this. I think there&amp;rsquo;s both a question of strategy and tactics. I think that all of this is with the understanding that what we&amp;rsquo;re opposing is not the free speech of fascists, or the speeches of fascists. What we&amp;rsquo;re doing is opposing the organizing of the fascists. So, for instance, in my workplace, I work with workers with a whole range of opinions on all different kinds of questions. And occasionally you&amp;rsquo;re going to run into people who are influenced by far right politics. In those circumstances it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me to start a fight, a physical fight with a coworker since they raised some perspective that comes from that background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s totally different than a situation where you have an organization or a personality who&amp;rsquo;s using the framework of a public speech or an event, a forum, in order to advance political goals. And so the way we look at it is the way we would look at any kind of organizing done by that group with those aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case at UC Berkeley, this outright celebrity and provocateur, Milo Yiannopoulos, very clearly is trying to advance a certain kind of politics and more and more is trying to shape it into a movement. Our understanding is that he was planning to out undocumented students at Berkeley for the sole purpose of putting them under attack by Trump&amp;rsquo;s immigration forces. And, so, in that circumstance, we can&amp;rsquo;t let that attack go unchallenged. And I think that when you look at it from that perspective, it makes sense to try and oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we just wait until they&amp;rsquo;ve created the groundswell, or created the base of support for these aggressive actions to take place, it can be too late. And so the way we approach fascist organizing or right wing organizing is not really focused on the question of free speech but is focused on whether or not we&amp;rsquo;re going to let them organize to implement their program. And our perspective is that we&amp;rsquo;re not. We&amp;rsquo;re going to challenge it. We&amp;rsquo;re going to try to stop it. We&amp;rsquo;re going to try to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>IWW Members Stand with Fired Ford Union Organizer in Spain—Solidarity is Strength! (en Inglés y Espanol)</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-members-stand-fired-ford-union-organizer-spain%E2%80%94solidarity-strength-en-ingl%C3%A9s-y-espanol</link>
 <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By John O&amp;rsquo;Reilly - &lt;a href=&quot;https://tcorganizer.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/iww-members-stand-with-fired-ford-union-organizer-in-spain-solidarity-is-strength-en-ingles-y-espanol/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Organizer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, April 26, 2017 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/20170324_165859.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;On Friday, March 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, Twin Cities IWW members gathered outside the Roseville Ford dealership to stand in solidarity with a fired union organizer from our sister union in Spain. An organizer with the National Confederation of Labor (or CNT, for its name in Spanish) was fired in retaliation for organizing in Valencia, Spain. His court date for reinstatement was set for March 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dealership manager approached our members and told them they were annoyed that we were picketing their workplace. The manager insisted that the site was union friendly and then sent out the union representative from the service workers to talk with IWW picketers. IWW member BP reports that &amp;ldquo;after some good conversation with the steward, he said he was on our side and took a large quantity of flyers &amp;ndash; much to the dismay of the manager!&amp;rdquo; Workers from the site soon gathered and mixed with IWW picketers, impressed by the dedication of our members to their coworker in Spain&amp;rsquo;s cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford&amp;rsquo;s restructuring plan, The Way Forward, lays out a strategy of closing down plants in the US and moving them overseas to countries where the wages are lower. That&amp;rsquo;s why, as IWW member ED&amp;nbsp;points out, &amp;ldquo;the Twin Cities factory shut down, taking away 2000 well payed union jobs, while production is ramping up in Spain, where labor laws are changing to make firing workers easier.&amp;rdquo; But the strategy only works as long as wages remain low in those countries. &amp;ldquo;So, by busting unions in Spain, Ford can keep outsourcing jobs, which busts unions here in the US. An injury to one is very much an injury to all,&amp;rdquo; ED&amp;nbsp;adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working class in the United States and globally is under attack by the international capitalists and their buddies in government. By moving labor and attacking workers organizations, the bosses try to keep us divided and fighting with each other, instead of working across national boundaries. Outsourcing only works if unions around the world are kept divided and weak. As ED&amp;nbsp;points out: &amp;ldquo;Global capitalism can only be answered with global labor solidarity!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Building Working-Class Defense Organizations: An Interview with the Twin Cities GDC</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/building-working-class-defense-organizations-interview-twin-cities-gdc</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://m1aa.org/?p=1316&quot;&gt;First of May Anarchist Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, December 4, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/TC_GDC_Defend.preview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;A PDF of this interview is &lt;a href=&quot;http://m1aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GDC-Interview.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The General Defense Committee of the Industrial Workers World (IWW) has become an important pole of struggle for pro-working-class revolutionaries in the Twin Cities. While active on a number of different fronts it is the participation of the General Defense Committee (GDC) in the year-long struggle against police killings and brutality in the Twin Cities that has largely led to the significant growth of the organization. The GDC has grown to approximately 90 dues-paying members in Minnesota, and has several active working-groups. In the wake of Trump&amp;rsquo;s election victory, Wobblies&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and others across the country have begun establishing their own GDC locals &amp;ndash; strongly influenced by the Twin Cities&amp;rsquo; model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of May Anarchist Alliance&lt;/strong&gt; spoke to Erik D. secretary of the Twin Cities GDC Local 14 about the history and work of the General Defense Committee there. Erik is a father, husband, education worker, and wobbly, who&amp;rsquo;s also been involved in the youth-focused intergenerational group, the Junior Wobblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fellow Worker Erik &amp;ndash; can you tell us about the origins and history of the General Defense Committee, its relationship to the IWW and how the militants who founded the current Local conceived of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, the General Defense Committee (GDC) was first founded by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1917, in response to the repression of wobblies and anti-WWI draft protests. I haven&amp;rsquo;t learned enough about the historic GDC to really speak much about it. I joined the IWW in 2006, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t formally charter the current local as a GDC until 2011. In 2011, the committee was 13 wobblies. But we had actually started organizing ourselves prior to 2011, calling ourselves the Local Defense Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there historical or modern examples or inspirations that influence the way GDC sees itself, its activity and organization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve appreciated about the Twin Cities GDC is the very practical intention to learn, with a specific focus on learning in order to act. From the very beginning we engaged in mutual education. Since one of our early orientations was to anti-fascist and anti-racist work, we did a fair bit of reading on the topic of fascism and anti-fascism (Sunday mornings with coffee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention this period of mutual education because we have a lot of inspirations, but none of them have been role models, per se. We have looked to previous movements largely in order to inform our own work and to learn from our elders and the experience of previous generations, but not as Role Models To Be Emulated. That&amp;rsquo;s been important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that caveat, we have a lot of inspiration. I get new inspiration every time I read a book, it seems. Some of the inspiration is local: here, I&amp;rsquo;d specifically highlight Anti-Racist Action and Teamsters Local 544. Anti-Racist Action (ARA) came out of a Minneapolis-based group of anti-racist skinheads who decided they needed to find a way to kick racist skins and organized fascists out of the Twin Cities. Teamsters Local 544 was the local that organized the 1934 strike that made Minneapolis a union town, innovated new forms of the picket (specifically, the &amp;lsquo;flying picket&amp;rsquo;), and engaged for a short time in open physical confrontation on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Twin Cities, I think our members have a lot of very different inspirations. One of mine has always been John Brown, but I grew up partly in Kansas. I guess the Black Panther Party would be the most common source of inspiration among early members; our advocacy of Community Self Defense certainly owes a lot to the Panthers, including their Survival Programs. The most recent addition to my &amp;lsquo;Hall of Inspiration&amp;rsquo; is Rudy Shields, whom I learned about from Akinyele Omowale Umoja&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the first projects of the Twin Cities GDC was organizing a &amp;ldquo;Picket Training&amp;rdquo;, which seems like a kind of simple project, but you all attached some importance to it. How come?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the history of the Picket Training is actually the beginning of the history of the local GDC, so forgive me for a longer answer. The IWW was always heavily involved in local May Day events, naturally. In both 2007 and 2008 we had dispiriting and potentially dangerous experiences in marches that were organized by other groups. These happened when we were &amp;lsquo;out-marshaled&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;peace-policed.&amp;rsquo; Folks might remember the 2006 &amp;ldquo;Day Without An Immigrant.&amp;rdquo; In 2007 immigrant protection and rights continued to be major issues, and the march was partly centered around pro-immigrant demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was worrying when wobblies who had been active in local anti-fascist actions saw someone they thought they knew from a fascist rally elsewhere in the state videotaping the crowd (we were never able to confirm the identity because of what happened next). Fascists videotaping an immigrants rights march is extremely concerning; they were likely videotaping either to research immigrants rights&amp;rsquo; groups (including antifa groups), or to identify potentially undocumented people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few wobblies went to talk to the videotaper and get in the way of the camera. Shouting commenced, and the self-appointed organizers of the march successfully pushed the wobblies back into the crowd, allowing the videotaping to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The May Day parade the next year found wobblies promoting militant chants shut down by the same sort of marshals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At roughly the same time, the local IWW was doing a lot of organizing. While some of us had prior experience in organizing pickets and direct actions, the Starbucks Workers campaign, the Jimmy John&amp;rsquo;s campaign, the Sisters Camelot Canvas Union, and the Chicago-Lake Liquors campaigns all provided early experience and training in planning and executing pickets and direct actions, in a context where we were already committed to IWW ideas and practices. Some of these were particularly challenging, such as doing intelligence and the occasional flying picket of scab canvassers in the Sisters Camelot campaign. Since they never stayed put, it felt like a throwback to the 1934 strikes and the flying pickets. It was cold both Winters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one particular occasion at the University of Minnesota AFSCME strike in 2007 where the IWW promoted, and executed, a hard picket line in the early morning hours at a delivery dock. This was going extremely well until a UMN delivery truck driver rammed the picket line. I was in the wrong place at the moment, and ended up on his hood. I found out later I&amp;rsquo;d crushed three neck vertebrae; it took two surgeries and a lot of physical therapy to get past it. It also gave me a serious motivation for doing pickets and direct actions better. Just a week after a truck hit me, a delivery truck hit another picketer at an IWW picket of D&amp;rsquo;Amico&amp;rsquo;s restaurant, thankfully without serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, 2008 was the end of an intense two-year process organized at disrupting the Republican National Convention. Most of us already had a critique of &amp;lsquo;summit hopping&amp;rsquo; styles of disruption, few of which have been effective since before the FTAA in Miami 2003. But a number of wobblies were serious and on occasion influential participants in (at least the early period of) the two years of planning that ended up calling itself the &amp;ldquo;Welcoming Committee.&amp;rdquo; The Welcoming Committee meetings (which were held in the same community space as the early IWW at the time, the Jack Pine Community Center) hammered out some early agreements and principles, including, along with other interested groups, the well-known Saint Paul Principles. This process also gave local wobblies experience in critically thinking through on-the-street tactics and what it would take to actually win goals and actions on those streets, whether in labor pickets or direct actions&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these motivations and experiences were in the forefront of our minds when we thought up the picket training. We knew we had to get better at this, and though we all had some experience, that&amp;rsquo;s not the same thing as having teachable knowledge. So we researched, wrote, debated, and practiced. We adopted a principle of teaching the tactics quickly rather than perfecting the training first, and encouraged people to think about themselves as the next trainers. In order to keep track of our curriculum and to make it portable, we created a trainer&amp;rsquo;s manual, a trainee manual, and a setup manual, which we update frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer the trainings to non-wobblies, and while we avoid being an on-call security group, we are trusted locally as providing quality security and planning successful actions. With the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and on-the-streets protest since Ferguson, I think the GDC has earned a bit of respect from other local organizations as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unionism and Anti-Fascism</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/unionism-and-anti-fascism</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement on Opposing All Oppression from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twincitiesgdc.org/antifascism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twin Cities GDC Local 14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/Didnottread.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;1. ANY SUCCESSFUL WORKER REVOLUTION WILL REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM DIVERSE MEMBERS OF THE WORKING CLASS, CURRENTLY DIVIDED BY MANY OPPRESSIONS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fight against capitalism. We do so because capitalism is organized theft based on hierarchy. We unionize because fighting this authoritarian theft can be done most successfully in the workplace, at the point of production. In unionizing we face many challenges, from creating strategies and tactics to accomplish our goals, as well as maintaining morale, fighting spirit, and solidarity with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult challenges the working class faces is that of oppressive social divisions. We may be of a single class, but we are not the same as a result. In addition to experiencing the oppressions of our class, we have differing experiences of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism and Islamphobia, along with other types of oppressions. Some of us experience privilege on the basis of our race, sex, gender, or religion, while others among us experience oppression on precisely the same grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling classes know this, of course. It is one of their favorite strategies for destroying organized workers: divide and conquer. Many of these oppressions exist in starkest relief in America&amp;rsquo;s massive prison-industrial system, where wardens encourage and enforce racial segregation and violence among prisoners, precisely as a system of maintaining control. These forms of control through oppression are not limited to prisons, of course. We see and experience them in our daily lives, and in our workplaces as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain solidarity with all workers requires that we maintain explicit solidarity with workers on the diverse grounds of their oppression. Our revolution cannot maintain a merely minimal, workerist, program which concentrates on the oppression of labor and leaves other problems solely to those workers who face them. Given the still relatively homogenous makeup of the Industrial Workers of the World, to do so sends a clear message to the working class experiencing such oppressions that the class struggle and their struggles against racism, gendered, or religious oppression are separate issues. If you were already struggling to keep the basics of your life together in the face of constant attacks on your person, would you be interested in taking on another massive but unconnected struggle in your workplace? By pointing out the ways in which struggles against all oppression support and further our collective freedom from class and other oppressions, we gain strength as a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither have we proceeded, historically, with a minimal program of workplace organization that leaves other oppressions unchallenged. The Industrial Workers of the World were founded in 1905 in part precisely to overcome the divisions of race, sex, religion, language, nationality, etc., among the working class. Militantly in favor of the organization of the entire working class, Wobblies quickly turned toward the power of young women in garment factories, racially-mixed work-gangs on the waterfronts, and nationally diverse immigrant groups. The IWW took on the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations that attempted to divide the class on the grounds of race. More recently, some IWW branches have begun to successfully undermine the divisions of oppressions based on gendered identities in ways that seem truly revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The 4th Precinct: a black anarchist’s perspective on struggle in Minneapolis’ Northside streets </title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/4th-precinct-black-anarchist%E2%80%99s-perspective-struggle-minneapolis%E2%80%99-northside-streets</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Ikemba Kuti - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://libcom.org/library/4th-precinct-black-anarchist%E2%80%99s-perspective-struggle-minneapolis%E2%80%99-northside-streets-ikemb&quot;&gt;First of May Anarchist Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, March 25, 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://libcom.org/files/imagecache/article/images/library/4thPrecintAPCBanner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;On November 15th, 2015, police executed Jamar   Clark in North  Minneapolis, MN. Several witnesses claim that Mr. Clark was handcuffed  and on the ground when he was shot in the head.   Following the execution,  an occupation of the 4th precinct police station took place on Plymouth  Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call for the encampment and occupation came from Black Lives  Matter &amp;ndash; Minneapolis. BLM-MPLS, is a part of the nation-wide    organization of chapters that is backed by the Democratic Party of the  same system that ensures black and brown communities are hyper-  policed.  BLM-St. Paul is not a part of the nation-wide organization, and has even  been condemned for making Black Lives Matter as a whole   &amp;ldquo;look bad&amp;rdquo; for  simply chanting &amp;ldquo;Pigs in a blanket, fry &amp;lsquo;em like bacon&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; while they are  not a   chartered chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BLM-MPLS&amp;rsquo; call for the encampment resulted in BLM organizers heading  the movement with little to no democratic process until later   in the  struggle. The encampment also generated tensions arising from different  agendas, ideologies, levels of anger, and an array of   different tactics  that different organizations and members of the community aimed to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nationally connected Black Lives Matter-Minneapolis did, and  does, great work at getting people to come out. Unfortunately, they   also  do great work channeling that revolutionary energy into their dogmatic  nonviolent reformism due to an undeniable affiliation with the    Democratic Party (the system), which must be noted by those interested  in liberation of the people, and which is quickly revealed through    research on those who are heading #CampaignZero (Black Lives Matter flow  chart to attain a world with limited police terror).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note of campaign zero&amp;rsquo;s four person &amp;ldquo;planning team&amp;rdquo; these are  important facts: &amp;ldquo;In 2014, Brittany helped   bring community voice to the  Ferguson Commission and President Obama&amp;rsquo;s Task Force on 21st Century  Policing as an appointee to each.   She&amp;rsquo;s been named one of TIME  Magazine&amp;rsquo;s 12 New Faces of Black Leadership&amp;rdquo;&lt;a class=&quot;see-footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnoteref1_rescowm&quot; title=&quot;http://www.joincampaignzero.org/about/&quot; href=&quot;https://libcom.org/library/4th-
precinct-black-anarchist%E2%80%99s-perspective-struggle-minneapolis%E2%80%99-northside-streets-ikemb#footnote1_rescowm&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. This individual works directly for the   president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining three are also heavily connected to non-profits such as  Teach for America (TFA), which is also historically connected to    maintaining the system. For example: TFA was recently given a grant to  continue to project their brand through the media.  Furthermore,   another  member of this four-person team was the other recipient; she is the  director of St Louis TFA. TFA is, effectively, the leading   edge of the  neoliberal attempts to gut city schools and further hinder education  equity, which in turn systemically hinders black and   brown kids  educational achievement under the guise of helping those kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an anarchist, of African descent, I argue that we need  revolutionary struggle controlled by the grassroots and not by top-down    leaders. It was the domination of top-down leadership from  BLM-Minneapolis, and their seemingly unconscious commitment to the  system, that   effectively steered Northside community militants away from  1) the encampment, 2) becoming further politicized, and 3) in playing  any role   in the organizing of their own communities self-determination.  Their voices were effectively hushed; just as the system we function  under   has done for centuries to oppressed people of color.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>On Voting</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/voting-0</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By FW W.H. Glazer - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://tcorganizer.com/2016/01/20/on-voting-by-fw-w-h-glazer/&quot;&gt;Twin Cities IWW&lt;/a&gt;, January 20, 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/voting.jpg&quot; /&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Every four years, Americans are subjected to a painfully long election cycle. It is January of a presidential election year, and that means that we can anticipate another ten months of mainstream media coverage that manages to simultaneously overwhelm us with its volume and leave us with no novel or useful information (did you know, for example, that Dr. Ben Carson was a rageful and violent nerd growing up in Detroit? Or that Donald Trump is a shameless blowhard whose racist, classist, and sexist rhetoric appeals to a sizeable group of racists, classists, and sexists?). My boss loves to play CNN in the office as background noise, but my proximity to the television means that I know a lot more about Martin O&amp;rsquo;Malley and Carly Fiorina than I ever needed to. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;Inherent in the decision to enact non-stop coverage is an assumption that all of this election stuff really matters, that who you support and ultimately vote for can have a tangible effect on the lives of millions of people. We are taught from a young age that our right to vote is a tremendously precious one, and further that failure to participate in the election process is a failure of civic duty. We are Americans, god dammit, and it is our responsibility to uphold justice and liberty and democracy through our voting process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;From a pragmatic standpoint, there is actually some truth to this idea. It is, from a purely practical point of view, smart to vote for the lesser of two evils. Hillary Clinton is less likely to impose anti-Muslim immigration reforms than is Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders is considerably less scary and objectionable than are the cackling hyenas who comprise the Republican field. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;In the IWW, though, we can&amp;rsquo;t only think in terms of pragmatism and practicality. We are a revolutionary anti-capitalist union, and it can be convincingly argued that active participation in electoral politics is not only counterproductive for our organizational goals, but counter-revolutionary. After all, no major party candidate will ever advocate for the dissolution of our capitalist economy and the establishment of a worker run society. Voting third party in a presidential race may be more morally justifiable, but barring tremendous social and political upheaval, a third party candidate will never take the White House.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
