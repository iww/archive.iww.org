 <title>Atlanta GMB Statement on the Planned Execution of Troy Davis</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/atlanta-gmb-statement-planned-execution-troy-davis</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Troy Anthony Davis is obviously the most innocent man on the face of  this earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet he continues to face down his executioner. There is no physical  evidence against him. No court testimony which is not tainted by obvious  bias. No doubting that Sylvester Coles, one of those to testify in court  and one of the few who did not recant his testimony, identified that he  himself was the shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our world innocence is a thing which must be proven, like in the old  days of the Napoleonic Code of Law, as during the days of kings and  queens and dungeon-and-cudgel justice. Until then, we are guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World stands in  solidarity with Troy Davis and his family. We call for the indefinite  stay of his death sentence, and the death sentences of all those  imprisoned by the laws of a country which prosecutes innocence by the  testimony of the guilty. We call for his immediate release, without  exception, without hesitation, and without doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IWW demands that the State of Georgia will recognize the  impermissible and unacceptable nature of the &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; and testimony  submitted in court against him. We stand not just for the very serious  and well-documented questions that exist about Troy Davis&amp;rsquo; guilt; we  stand for common decency, common justice, and common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things that the state of Georgia is guilty of itself: the  worst history in the nation of executing and lynching innocent black  people is one. It is a very old, hallowed tradition and we should like  to see its continuance brought to an end. The State, too, is guilty of  having the seventh highest rate of capital punishment convictions in the  country. We call for an immediate end to this. We call for an end to all  this vulgarity that is advanced as justice in this country. We call for  all such poisons as pentobarbital and sodium thiopental to be  neutralized, made harmless, and discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IWW intends to continue to march in solidarity with those in support  of Troy Davis up to his planned execution date of Wednesday, September  21st, and beyond. We lock arms with those who call him friend, brother,  son, and lover and expect to welcome him back into our midst any day  now, when the conscience and good reason of those who detain him finally  gives way to the plain notion that those who are innocent are not  guilty, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand definitively and decidedly against those, like U.S. District  Judge William T. Moore Jr., who will condemn Mr. Troy Anthony Davis to  his death by the statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;ldquo;Troy Davis is not innocent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is not innocence, indeed, and if this is what not-innocence  deserves, perhaps we are all guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IWW is Troy Davis, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Solidarity, &lt;br /&gt;
The Atlanta General Membership Branch of The Industrial Workers of the  World.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Atlanta GMB Celebrates New Charter</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/atlanta-gmb-celebrates-new-charter-0</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Fellow workers, comrades, unionists, socialists, anarchists and a veritable gaggle of other local Atlantans, bent all of their own fashion someway Leftward, gathered together this past Saturday for the Industrial Workers of the World branch party. The stupendously successful fundraiser had people dancing, drinking, and singing along the whole night through to the sweet sounds of Grand Prize Winners From Last Year, I Want Whiskey, and Flex Your Head. Fresh food was served off the grill and donations were accepted in front, where t-shirts, literature, and a variety of other informative merchandise were on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house was packed with an estimate of around 60 people at the height of the event and the entire undertaking netted close to $300 for the branch! Thanks to May, owner of Cabbagetown barbershop The Cut, for renting the space to the IWW and thanks to all those who showed and participated in Atlanta&amp;rsquo;s first Wobbly funding event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of discussion by attendees between musical acts. Among the most important questions at hand were: Can and when will leftwing groups, including members of the ISO, Teamsters, various unions, the IWW, and social activist and student groups, articulate an operative and all-inclusive umbrella network that can be mobilized in times of specific need or crisis? What is the easiest and best way to contact and motivate members of society who would consider themselves of the non-participating mainstream of the culture so as to incite large-scale change during a crisis? What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to organize nonprofit work places and other nonunion public shops? To what extent should workers&amp;rsquo; movements be involved in electoral politics on a state or national level, if at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we unite and stay conscious and fight together,&amp;rdquo; said IWW delegate, &amp;ldquo;who can stop us? It&amp;rsquo;s workers who have changed society for the better -- common people -- and no one else.&amp;rdquo; The crowd called back in agreement, joined hands, and sung in unison Ralph Chaplin&amp;rsquo;s classic &amp;lsquo;Solidarity Forever.&amp;rsquo; The group later gathered together for photographs around the framed and newly issued branch charter which was printed on authentic hundred-year-old Wobbly paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>This is what FBI harassment looks like</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/1972</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Tabitha Chase - &lt;em&gt;Industrial Worker&lt;/em&gt;, February 2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/portraits/others/bilde.jpg&quot; /&gt;When I awoke on March 17, 2005, I checked my phone and found that I had five calls from three different phone numbers that I did not recognize. All of them were from special agent Dante Jackson of the FBI stating that I &amp;ldquo;had to call him back.&amp;rdquo; I immediately called my friend and attorney Ken Driggs, gave him the name of the agent and numbers, and asked him to find out what these calls were about. He called back later that day saying that they &amp;ldquo;were demanding a compulsory interview, and that should I refuse to schedule one or fail to show up, they would come and pick me up.&amp;rdquo; We scheduled the appointment for the following day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/1972&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
