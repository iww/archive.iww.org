 <title>Anti-racist message from Clydeside IWW | St Andrewâ€™s Day march 2016</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/anti-racist-message-clydeside-iww-st-andrew%E2%80%99s-day-march-2016</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Edinburgh Wobbly - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://iwwscotland.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/anti-racist-message-from-clydeside-iww-st-andrews-day-march-2016/&quot;&gt;IWW Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, November 25, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iww.org/sites/default/files/images/iww-no-borders_0_0.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Now more than ever we need organising that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anti-racist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; internationalist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s victory in the US elections, following the recent Brexit vote, creates a whole new political climate in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, working class people have suffered a massive attack with the loss of traditional industries, in favour of low-paid service jobs, and the destruction of the labour movement.&amp;nbsp; The neoliberal model that was created was based on growth through the financial sector and it led to the 2008 economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the UK government bailed out the banks it forced us to shoulder the cost through austerity, cutting vital services and targetting the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left responded to post-crisis austerity first through mass protest around the world, and then the rise of several populist movements seeking parliamentary power.&amp;nbsp; One by one, they have been defeated or have so far been unable to provide any real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now things are about to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many uncertainties &amp;ndash; what will Brexit mean? how will Trump govern?&amp;nbsp; What we can expect in the UK is that austerity will go on, even if the aim is no longer to cut the deficit, and real wages &amp;nbsp;will continue to decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Brexit and Trump&amp;rsquo;s presidency are a victory for the far right.&amp;nbsp; Immigration to the UK will be curbed and border controls will become even more cruel.&amp;nbsp; Racism against ethnic minorities will be reinforced by the tabloid media as the nationalist dream fails to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we know that &lt;strong&gt;migrants don&amp;rsquo;t lower wages &amp;ndash; bosses do&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/anti-racist-message-clydeside-iww-st-andrew%E2%80%99s-day-march-2016&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>The IWW grassroots direct action unionism in 5 easy steps</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/iww-grassroots-direct-action-unionism-5-easy-steps</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the Bristol IWW - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/the-iww-grassroots-direct-action-unionism-in-5-easy-steps/&quot;&gt;Bristol IWW&lt;/a&gt;, November 30, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/cropped-cropped-middle-proper.jpg&quot; /&gt;1&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re having problems at your workplace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;You may not be getting your correct pay, or your correct sickness pay, or holiday entitlement, but you are unsure what to do because you haven&amp;rsquo;t got anything written, or you do but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense to you and nobody has bothered to explain it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You want to do something about it,&lt;/strong&gt; but you don&amp;rsquo;t really know what your rights are and what the law says. You may be bullied, harassed or intimidated by colleagues and/or managers, and feel isolated and depressed. Or, perhaps, you may actually like your job, get on with your colleagues and not have any problems at all with it. You may be unemployed, or a student or a retired person. You may think you have nothing in common with people in different circumstances, but we think you do: &lt;strong&gt;we think you should all join the IWW&lt;/strong&gt;. In the IWW we believe that whether you are in work or not right now, you are still part of a society based on paid work and as such you will be affected by it at some point or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the IWW we believe you don&amp;rsquo;t join the union only when you have a problem&lt;/strong&gt; that you need an &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; to fix; we think you should join anyway because being in a grassroots union is a key element of being involved and engaged with the world you live in. We think everyone has the right to take control and power back over their lives and work. We think everyone has the right to learn about employment rights and legislation and &lt;strong&gt;become their own &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. We become &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; through formal training courses in casework and organising, but mostly we learn informally, by sharing knowledge and skills and supporting each other. We are grassroots, we are democratic, and we are fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fightingcat.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;253&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;fightingcat&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/fightingcat-253x300.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-402 alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a member now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; and suddenly you do have problems in your workplace. Your manager may have decided to change your terms and conditions and demanded you to accept. You may notice you are not getting paid all the hours you are working. You may be under a lot of stress and pressure at work and have to take time off work sick because of it. &lt;strong&gt;Who you gonna call? The Wobblies!&lt;/strong&gt; You arrange to meet with one of our caseworkers and go through things with them. You finally have someone to talk to who will listen to you and give you guidance and support, help you understand the law and what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the IWW we believe in EMPOWERMENT not delegation: &lt;/strong&gt;we don&amp;rsquo;t do things FOR you, we do things WITH you. Once you have a clearer idea of the options available to you, it is up to you to decide what steps to take, knowing that the IWW will have your back. The IWW can help you in many different ways, from standard workplace procedures such as grievances and disciplinaries to more complex casework such as supporting you to take your case to an Employment Tribunal if appropriate. All these words and expression may mean nothing to you at the beginning, and you may feel overwhelmed by it all, but slowly, with the help of your IWW rep, you will become your own &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo;. You will start to understand, learn and feel empowered: &lt;strong&gt;knowledge is power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;So, your case is ongoing and we are following the standard procedures. &lt;/strong&gt;We may be supporting to write formal demands to your employer, attending meetings alongside you, helping you to find a good solicitor, advocating on your behalf with your employer or other organisations (such as ACAS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes though things don&amp;rsquo;t work,&lt;/strong&gt; maybe because your employer is not responding, or because the nature of your employment is such that standard procedures are not appropriate. So, what happens then? Simple: we use direct action. &lt;strong&gt;We get together, because together we are stronger,&lt;/strong&gt; and we get your case &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo;. We may ask people to call or write to your employer and complain about they way they are treating you. We may ask for a boycott of the company you are working for. We may get in touch with local and national press to publicise your case. We may hold a demonstration at your workplace until your employer meets your demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we have done recently for one of our members who had her wages withheld by the cafe she worked at. And just in case you are wondering, &lt;strong&gt;yes, it did work:&lt;/strong&gt; direct action does get the goods! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/&quot;&gt;Read our report about it &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s outrageous? Unpaid wages!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.&lt;strong&gt; All is over now,&lt;/strong&gt; your employer has seen sense and you are in the pub celebrating with the Wobblies and your friends. You will feel knackered. You will also feel thrilled, energised, inspired. You will look at yourself in the mirror and know you have had the guts to stand up for your rights, no matter how stressful it has been. You have learned that you are not alone, and you will never feel alone again when standing up to your boss because the IWW will always have your back. &lt;strong&gt;So, what next?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so, you could complete our training courses in casework and organising. You will now have the knowledge and skills to support people in the same situation, and you will have a personal understanding of how it feels to have a dispute with your employer and WIN. &lt;strong&gt;The sky is our only limit, for us Wobblies! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Whatâ€™s outrageous? Unpaid wages! Report from solidarity demo</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/what%E2%80%99s-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-solidarity-demo</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Communications Officer - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bristol IWW&lt;/a&gt;, November 14, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/DSCN1107-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Fellow Wobblies and supporters, Bristol Communications Officer here to report on the wet but very successful solidarity demo held this morning in Bristol outside Cafe Amore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We organised the demo in solidarity with Fellow Worker Bonny, who worked at Cafe Amore for a while and was not paid the full wages she was owed after quitting. Bristol IWW union representative assisted her in writing a demand letter to the cafe&amp;rsquo;s boss, which Bonny then delivered by hand a week ago accompanied by fellow Wobblies. During the week, the boss paid her some of the money she was owed but not all of it, and didn&amp;rsquo;t provide a clear explanation as to why he couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay the whole amount, and when he would do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, on we went this Saturday to hold a solidarity demo demanding the cafe&amp;rsquo;s boss to pay Bonny her wages, as well as to highlight the bad practices that Cafe Amore use on their staff &amp;ndash; unpaid trials, underpaying migrant staff, and forced unpaid overtime. &lt;/strong&gt;Despite the relentless rain, we had a very successful demonstration attended by around 30 people, with many members and supporters of the IWW, and members of Bristol SolNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Before the start of the demo, Bonny went in the cafe accompanied by her union rep and other members of the IWW to renew her demand and hand out flyers to customers. The boss was very aggressive towards them, making excuses as to why he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to pay Bonny&amp;rsquo;s full wages, and being very vague as to when he would pay her the remaining amount. He then went on to tell another IWW member who was trying to talk to customers to &amp;ldquo;get out of here or I&amp;rsquo;ll beat you up&amp;rdquo; in front of all the customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We stood outside the cafe for an hour, handing out flyers and singing songs in support of Bonny, and having lots of fun Wobbly-style! Lots of passers-by stopped to ask us what was going on and expressed interest and support for Bonny and what we were doing. But, Cafe Amore&amp;rsquo;s boss still hasn&amp;rsquo;t paid Bonny all the money she&amp;rsquo;s owed! Bristol IWW will carry on holding weekly solidarity demos outside Cafe Amore until Bonny&amp;rsquo;s paid up all the money she&amp;rsquo;s owed. &lt;strong&gt;Keep checking our blog and, especially, our Facebook page and Twitter feed (links on the right) and, if Bonny still doesn&amp;rsquo;t get paid, see you on Saturday 21 November at 12pm outside Cafe Amore&lt;/strong&gt; (which is on Nelson Street, next to Holland &amp;amp; Barrett). Or, as we put it today in our chants: Pay Bonny her money and we&amp;rsquo;ll go away / Pay Bonny her money or we&amp;rsquo;re here to stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you also work in the bar &amp;amp; hospitality sector &amp;ndash; bars, pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, catering, etc? Does any of this sound familiar to you? The IWW has just launched a campaign to support and organise workers in these businesses. You can read our statement here:&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/iww-bar-hospitality-workers-campaign/&quot;&gt; statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We have also written an article on local paper &amp;ldquo;The Bristol Cable&amp;rdquo; highlighting the issues of bar &amp;amp; hospitality workers in Bristol. You can read it here:&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://thebristolcable.org/2015/11/is-your-waiter-fair-trade-and-ethically-sourced/#&quot;&gt; article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Bonny&amp;rsquo;s situation sounds familiar to you, and you need help and support to stand up to bully bosses who don&amp;rsquo;t pay wages and treat their workers like doormats, email us at &lt;em&gt;bristol@iww.org.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We are a grassroots union that uses direct action methods to support workers to fight back for their rights. This is what we can offer you: training to know Employment Law and (where possible) use it to get what you want; training to represent your Fellow Workers in grievance and disciplinary meetings; training to organise your co-workers so you can speak as one voice, and get more influence over what goes on at work; and, finally, TRAINING TO WIN &amp;ndash; better terms and conditions, better pay, and less bullying from your boss!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wobbling to Victory: Are militant unions anarchist wreckers or the future of the labour movement?</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/wobbling-victory-are-militant-unions-anarchist-wreckers-or-future-labour-movement</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Dek Keenan - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://usilive.org/opinions/wobbling-to-victory/&quot;&gt;Union Solidarity International&lt;/a&gt;, November 5, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/IWGB-3-Cosas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;In recent years, new or rediscovered forms of worker self-organisation have begun to appear &amp;ndash; and often in the most unlikely of places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small independent unions, using a combination of often audacious direct action tactics combined with innovative campaign strategies are bringing victories to some of the most marginalised and precarious groups of workers. Punching way above their weight, these dynamic new (and some not so new) unions are fighting to win and organising with few or no full-time officials and on shoestring budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they the work of anarchist wreckers, alien to the traditions of the labour movement, or do they offer a way out of the impasse that our movement finds itself in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, new unions such as the United Voices of the World (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.uvwunion.org.uk/&quot;&gt;UVW&lt;/a&gt;) and Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://iwgb.org.uk/&quot;&gt;IWGB&lt;/a&gt;) have been at the forefront of precarious, out-sourced and greatly migrant labour struggles. Recent high profile fights for the Living Wage, for sick pay and the reinstatement of union activists at the Barbican and at Sotheby&amp;rsquo;s auction house have brought the UVW into the media spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first signs in the UK of this &amp;lsquo;new unionism&amp;rsquo; were seen in 2011 when the Industrial Workers of the World (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://iww.org.uk/&quot;&gt;IWW&lt;/a&gt;), the famous &amp;lsquo;Wobblies&amp;rsquo;, organised a Branch for cleaners in London, recruiting dissatisfied members of Unite associated with the Latin American Workers Association (LAWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Branch built on the existing community of solidarity in the LAWA and, through the establishment of workers&amp;rsquo; advice clinics, language classes and much aggressive outreach by unpaid activists, expanded beyond the Latin American community to other groups of cleaners searching for an effective voice at work. London Living Wage victories at Canary Wharf and elsewhere followed, heightening the profile of the IWW and paving the way for subsequent initiatives from the UVW and IWGB.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Victory as People Power Forces Liverpool Council Homeless Fines U-Turn</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/victory-people-power-forces-liverpool-council-homeless-fines-u-turn</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Admin - &lt;a href=&quot;https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/victory-as-people-power-forces-liverpool-council-homeless-fines-u-turn/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liverpool IWW&lt;/a&gt;, November 5, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://liverpooliww.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/homelessness.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Liverpool Industrial Workers of the World unreservedly welcomes the sensational decision of Liverpool City Council to scrap their consultation on plans to fine the homeless a whole eight days ahead of its planned conclusion. We are delighted that homeless people now no longer face this added threat of being penalised for the social crime of homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Oxford, Hackney and Wycombe authority before them, Mayor Joe Anderson&amp;rsquo;s council has floated the idea, hoping it will go through, only to be overwhelmed by the public backlash against it. In doing so, the council has shown the potential of mass working class action to make changes in the world. Anderson and Liverpool Labour have given way on this one issue, because it risked jeopardising the rest of their austerity agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only yesterday morning, Liverpool IWW started a Facebook event page proposing a demonstration against the homeless fines. Within hours, scores had pledged they would attend, hundreds of people had been invited, and many were leaving comments on the page. Some raised their own demands, such as Joe Anderson paying back the &amp;pound;89,000 of public money he received from the council for legal advice on a private matter (he&amp;rsquo;d been sacked by a school he did no work for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homeless fines threatened to be a &amp;lsquo;straw that broke the camel&amp;rsquo;s back&amp;rsquo;. When asked by the media for a reaction in response to Liverpool IWW&amp;rsquo;s press release, the council retreated a step. The council&amp;rsquo;s deployment of pro-cuts Councillor Rachael O&amp;rsquo;Byrne to the Facebook event page confirms this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liverpool Labour&amp;rsquo;s explanation for the whole affair beggars belief. According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/news-and-comment/plans-to-fine-liverpool-beggars-1000-scrapped&quot;&gt;Liverpool Confidential&lt;/a&gt; , &amp;ldquo;Anderson intervened to have the scheme scrapped after hearing about the proposals yesterday [Wednesday]&amp;rdquo;. Councillor Steve Munby went on, &amp;ldquo;The proposal was not a decision by the council cabinet, but was drawn up by officers following complaints from residents and the BID [Business Improvement District].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are charitable to Anderson, it still looks devastatingly bad. He is the mayor of the city, he is paid a large salary, and he dines with the greedy business owners who were pushing this scheme on a very regular basis. If the official story is to be believed, he was somehow unaware of the council consultation nearly a month after it began on 9th October. He is therefore totally out of touch with the affairs of his own council, and totally incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The far more likely explanation, of course, is that Anderson, O&amp;rsquo;Byrne, Munby and colleagues are simply lying through their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liverpool IWW will continue to fight for the interests of all working class people in the local area, so we can guarantee that this is not the last that Mayor Anderson and all his bloodsoaked poverty pimps will hear of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://liverpooliww.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/homelessness.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=200&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Liverpool IWW condemns the council&amp;rsquo;s proposed &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/1MysqpE&quot;&gt;Public Space Protection Order&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, under which the homeless could be fined up to &amp;pound;1,000 for the &amp;lsquo;crime&amp;rsquo; of begging. We call on the people of Liverpool to show their opposition, by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/849669795153622/&quot;&gt;demonstrating&lt;/a&gt; at St Luke&amp;rsquo;s bombed out church a week on Saturday (14th November) from 12 noon, and signing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chn.ge/1Wyr0Ru&quot;&gt;Change.org petition&lt;/a&gt;, which already had nearly 7,000 signatures at the time of going to press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is shocking that we find ourselves in a position where we need to argue for the right of homeless people not to be fined for their poverty, but thanks to greedy mayor Joe Anderson this is exactly the situation we are in. No-one begs for the fun of it. People beg out of desperation, because our society has badly let them down. &amp;pound;1,000 would be a huge amount of money for any working class person, but for a homeless person it is almost unimaginable, and could never be paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Liverpool Labour wanted people to stop begging, they would stop implementing policies which massively increase poverty in our city. Instead, they aim to criminalise deprivation, in order to create a corporate paradise in Liverpool One, the Central &amp;lsquo;Business Improvement District&amp;rsquo;, and beyond. While Joe Anderson claims that his hands are tied by the Tory government when he makes spending cuts, it is his anti-homeless crusade which really shows what kind of man he is. Not content with using the police to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/02/liverpool-police-accused-of-trying-to-starve-activists-out-of-occupied-bank&quot;&gt;starve homeless people out of a former bank&lt;/a&gt; a few months back, he now seeks to use crushing fines to force homeless people out of the city where they may well have family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>OPEN LETTER TO IWW MEMBERS FROM some AngryWorkers</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/open-letter-iww-members-some-angryworkers</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Some Angry Workers - &lt;a href=&quot;https://angryworkersworld.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/open-letter-to-iww-members/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Angry Workers of the World&lt;/a&gt;, October 11, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s. We have republished this open letter to our union in order to stimulate discussion:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/tumblr_inline_n9nbxtzcgl1rby4la.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Autumnal greetings comrades!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have known some of you for a while, and met some more of you recently on our film screening &amp;lsquo;tour&amp;rsquo; earlier this year. It was great to make some new friends and have some good discussions about what we&amp;rsquo;re all up to. We thought we&amp;rsquo;d get in touch with you about some proposals for joint work in the coming year, let us know if you&amp;rsquo;re interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. We want to start an Amazon workers newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have lots of translated material of interviews with Amazon workers in Germany, Poland and India, as well as knowing comrades who work in, and have direct contact with, Amazon workers. We could turn this into an (irregular) 2-sided newsletter for Amazon workers in the UK. Polish comrades have set up a small section of the Workers Initiative (IP) syndicalist union inside the warehouse in Poznan, which is now the site of Europe&amp;rsquo;s biggest Amazon warehouse. It was built to undermine workers at struggling Amazon warehouses across Germany. Workers from Germany and Poland recently had a meeting together to discuss coordinating their efforts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://libcom.org/news/cross-border-amazon-workers-meeting-30092015#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://libcom.org/news/cross-border-amazon-workers-meeting-30092015#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the the recent meeting about transnational strikes in Poznan earlier this month we heard about the idea of Amazon workers organising a bus caravan through Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of yet, we have no contact with Amazon workers/militants in England who could participate in international meetings or coordinations like these ones. We think this newsletter would be a good step towards this. It would also let workers know what is happening at other Amazon warehouses, which may encourage their own activity e.g. other workers&amp;rsquo; experiences of union struggles such as those being led by the &lt;span class=&quot;skimlinks-unlinked&quot;&gt;ver.di union in Germany; how workers there don&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;lsquo;countdown&amp;rsquo; on their scanner/watch, which has relieved some of their work pressure; or the overtime slow-down strike in Poznan in support of the workers on strike in Germany (they had been ordered by management to work overtime as they supply for the German market, so essentially the workers in Poland were refusing to be scabs).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would any of you be interested in working on this together? Essentially this would mean co-writing and/or distributing the paper outside Amazon warehouses when shifts start and/or finish. Because we are based in London, we are not immediately near any Amazon warehouses but could also come from time to time to help out. You could build on these links in whatever ways you had the capacity for within your local. At the moment it just seems a shame that we have all these materials and contacts that would make a great newsletter and they&amp;rsquo;re not being put to use!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a list of Amazon warehouse locations below [1] so if your local has the time, capacity, energy and will to focus on these workers, or at least start something and then see how things go, get in touch and we can discuss in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re worried that your local not having the longer-term resources to support workers if the newsletter does prove to be a catalyst for workers wanting to organise, then let&amp;rsquo;s discuss how this could be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Liverpool IWW Spread Message that Claimant Advocacy is Not a Crime!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/liverpool-iww-spread-message-claimant-advocacy-not-crime</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Admin - &lt;a href=&quot;https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/liverpool-iww-spread-message-that-claimant-advocacy-is-not-a-crime/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liverpool IWW&lt;/a&gt;, October 12, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/scousewobs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This afternoon, members and supporters of Liverpool IWW held an  information picket outside the town centre job centre, on Williamson  Square. We are one of several IWW groups and other activist  organisations holding demonstrations at job centres this week. Scottish  Unemployed Workers Network called for solidarity with claimant advocate  Tony Cox, who faces court in Forfar tomorrow on the ludicrous charges of  threatening behaviour, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/901080539929227/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;refusing to give his name and address and resisting arrest&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested at an Arbroath job centre last January, whilst representing a highly vulnerable unemployed woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scottish Unemployed Workers Network assert that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We believe that this case highlights the climate of fear that is  evident within many job centres, but that it is not only benefit  claimants that are treated with contempt. Welfare advisors are also  being subjected to bullying and intimidation, as in the recent case of  Mike Vallance at High Riggs Job Centre, when they attempt to represent,  often highly vulnerable, benefit claimants. The SUWN will resist any and  all attempts to curb the rights of welfare and citizen advocates to  represent the unemployed, and we ask you to join us in our fight to  ensure that ADVOCACY IS NOT A CRIME.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Liverpool today, we distributed info provided by&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edinburghagainstpoverty.org.uk/node/32&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty&lt;/a&gt;,  backing up with legal statements the fact that &amp;lsquo;advocacy is not a  crime&amp;rsquo;. Claimants visiting the job centre took our advice  enthusiastically, and were generally pleased that someone was taking a  stand against the Department for Work and Pensions, and the bullying  regime inside job centres. Our social networking presence also got a  number of likes and follows during the picket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the response was so positive that we will soon begin a  regular series of job centre info distribution pickets, offering advice,  encouragement and solidarity to claimants &amp;ndash; who represent some of the  most vulnerable elements of the working class.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Language workers got Tallents!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/language-workers-got-tallents</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Angry Language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://libcom.org/blog/language-workers-got-tallents-27092015&quot;&gt;LibCom.Org&lt;/a&gt;, September 27, 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/180x187xEWIU620.jpg.pagespeed.ic.fpDvhmbgjh.jpg&quot; /&gt;Ultimately, we were forced to go down the legal route. That means that IWW members at LSSE only got the legal minimum, despite our belief that the callous mistreatment we suffered while at the school entitled us to further compensation. In any case, we got more than Craig had ever planned to give us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re proud to say that in our effort to make Craig pay up, the workers ran militant and well-organised campaign. We occupied the school. We forced Craig &lt;a href=&quot;http://libcom.org/blog/struggle-leicester-square-school-english-story-so-far-15012015&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to resign as a governor of the Bancroft School&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://asparagusconsulting.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shut down the website of another one of his business interests, Asparagus Consulting&lt;/a&gt;. We &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iww.org/content/callout-24-hour-email-campaign-target-wage-stealing-boss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hassled him at his residents&#039; association&lt;/a&gt;. We held numerous &lt;a href=&quot;http://libcom.org/blog/picket-leicester-square-school-english-21012015&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pickets and protests&lt;/a&gt; in Leicester Square and at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://libcom.org/blog/lsse-struggle-next-stop-drapers-09022015&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drapers&#039; Guild&lt;/a&gt;, where Craig is a member of some note &amp;ndash; actions which did not go unnoticed by senior officers of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To any other workers who may ever have the misfortune to work for Craig, we have a message for you: if he mistreats you in any way, you&#039;ve got the support of the Angry Language Brigade and the IWW. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re a language school worker or not; if Craig&#039;s your boss, we got your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let this be a message to any future would-be business partners: Craig Tallents is a toxic asset. Besides his consistently underhanded business practices, he&#039;s got two organisations who are ready and willing to picket and protest anywhere he sets up shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Bigger, the IWW caseworker who helped the workers, said &amp;ldquo;this case was a good example of a boss trying to hide when the going got tough. Future workers and business partners of Craig Tallents will no doubt take note of his actions. Bosses should take note of ours.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who&#039;ve followed the dispute, one of the key issues was that Craig had illegally and intentionally misclassified a number of teachers as self-employed. This meant that when Craig shut down the school, he thought he could do so without paying those teachers thousands of pounds in holiday and notice pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that if you&#039;ve been misclassified &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://libcom.org/blog/tackling-uks-%E2%80%9Cfreelance%E2%80%9D-tefl-scandal-18112014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a major problem in language schools&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; you have recourse. Raise it collectively with your workmates or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/status-customer-service-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contact HMRC&lt;/a&gt; who can contact your employer to make them sort out their records and pay you any back pay to which you may be entitled. HMRC can be contacted anonymously, but it&#039;s probably best if you have someone like a union rep call on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>There will be no unpaid workers at the Co-op!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/there-will-be-no-unpaid-workers-co-op</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Dorsett IWW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://dorsetiww.wordpress.com/2015/09/17/there-will-be-no-unpaid-workers-at-the-co-op/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dorsett IWW&lt;/a&gt;, September 17, 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/images/coop1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Dorset IWW General Members&amp;rsquo; Branch is pleased to announce that our dispute with a Bournemouth outlet of the Co-operative has been settled amicably. We have a verbal assurance from local management who are USDAW members, that they have no wish to exploit unpaid workers on their premises, and that their connection with &amp;lsquo;Prospects&amp;rsquo; has been severed. We congratulate them on their principled decision and affirm our commitment to defeat the government&amp;rsquo;s work programme and end unpaid labour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally however, the situation is less clear; we have had sight of a Co-op internal document that sets out the parameters of their unpaid work experience programme. Whilst it insists that placements must be voluntary and offer meaningful experience, we note that vulnerable adults are being conscripted who may not be fully aware of their rights. It&amp;rsquo;s highly likely some of them will not be able to make an informed decision and/or will get browbeaten by jobcentre staff with targets to meet. Once they are on the scheme if they leave they may be deemed to have made themselves intentionally unemployed, and be sanctioned. Lastly of course, however you dress it up, it&amp;rsquo;s unpaid labour. How long does it take to assess a person&amp;rsquo;s suitability for working in a grocer&amp;rsquo;s shop? A week, two? Why then should a national chain not speculate a fortnight&amp;rsquo;s minimum wage to find out?&lt;/p&gt;
