 <title>Wobs “instrumental” in getting worker’s job back</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/wobs-%E2%80%9Cinstrumental%E2%80%9D-getting-worker%E2%80%99s-job-back</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By 6eoff - &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://iwwboston.org/2016/01/25/wobs-instrumental-in-getting-workers-job-back/&quot;&gt;Boston IWW&lt;/a&gt;, January 25, 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.iww.org/sites/default/files/img_6910.jpg&quot; /&gt;Pictured are MISU&amp;rsquo;s John P (recently reinstated), Evan and John M, as well as Genevieve, Geoff, Max and Jon from the Boston IWW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IWW members returned to aid our friends and fellow workers in the Museum Independent Security Union on 1/23/16. Despite freezing temperatures, our hearts were warmed by a message from John M of MISU, who conveyed his belief that IWW support was &amp;ldquo;instrumental&amp;rdquo; in getting unfairly-fired MISU member John P re-hired with no discipline and with back pay. John P was fired by Boston&amp;rsquo;s Museum of Fine Arts merely for fulfilling his responsibilities as a parent. The outcry that followed (which Boston wobs are proud have helped with) compelled the museum to take John back. The MFA has been forcing working parents out of their jobs and taking a hard line in contract negotiations with MISU, and the battle is not over yet. Please join the Boston IWW and MISU for pickets at the Museum of Fine Arts, Saturdays from 12-2 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>HARVARD SQ: STARBUCKS WORKERS UNDER ATTACK!!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/harvard-sq-starbucks-workers-under-attack</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 17, Starbucks Coffee abruptly informed &amp;quot;shift supervisors,&amp;quot; also known as shifts, in MA that they would no longer receive any income from customers&#039; tips as of January 7. Shift supervisors have extra responsibilities, but start at just $11/hr. The loss of tips represents a cut of up to 10-20% of their income! Shifts comprise roughly one third of Starbucks&#039; MA workforce. The company has said it will not provide any immediate raise to make up for the effective salary cut, and that any future increase shifts may receive won&#039;t be retroactive. For years, Starbucks has essentially arranged for customers to subsidize shifts&#039; low pay with tips, but the MA courts have ruled this illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifts are demanding that their huge, profitable employer ensures no Starbucks worker loses income from the court ruling on tips. They want a $4/hour raise, and transparency from the company, which has been maddeningly opaque in its dealings with employees, refusing to say anything about any possible raise until a petition &lt;a href=&quot;http://starbucksunion.org/come-together-fair-pay-ma&amp;gt;by&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; shifts called attention to their plight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/content/harvard-sq-starbucks-workers-under-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Boston IWW Joins Striking Verizon Workers on the Picket Line</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/content/boston-iww-joins-striking-verizon-workers-picket-line</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Members of the Boston IWW joined striking Verizon workers for their second day of pickets at the regional headquarters in downtown Boston.   Striking members of IBEW local 2222 were pleased with the show of solidarity as we marched together in the sometimes driving rain. The strikers were in good spirits as they walked the all-day picket line and confronted scabs at the local Verizon Headquarters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workers went on strike after Verizon, taking advantage of the current economy and widespread attacks on the working class, demanded concessions from the workers while the company and its top executives have taken in billions of dollars in profits.  In fact, the company has made more than $15 billion in profits in the past four years while at the same time paying no federal income tax from 2009-2010 and instead receiving over $1 billion in tax refunds. The company was demanding that workers contribute more to healthcare costs, the elimination of pensions, a reduction in sick pay and elimination of Veteran&amp;rsquo;s and Martin Luther King day as paid holidays. Further, the company was pushing to have more work outsourced to non-union workers.  As a result of these demands the negotiations broke down and 45,000 workers from CWA and IBEW walked out, including 6,000 in Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times tensions rose during the picket as scabs exited the building.  At one point food was delivered to the workers inside by the notoriously exploitative Upper Crust Pizza, who previously had their windows smashed on May Day because of their abuse of workers. Picketers attempted to block the delivery of the food while police protected those making the delivery. Tempers flared and at one point 100s of sodas were knocked from a palate and later thrown at the delivery van.  Workers also attempted to encircle and block the van until finally cops and union bosses convinced them to let the van flee the scene. The picketers showed a degree of militancy and class outrage not commonly seen at other pickets and labor rallies.  One Verizon worker who was not familiar with the IWW was given a  flyer explaining the position of the IWW and was very receptive. The Verizon workers plan on being out on the picket lines every day for at least two weeks. The Boston branch plans on supporting them as long as the strike continues while at the same time spreading the idea of revolutionary unionism to the rank and file workers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Co-op accused of union-busting</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4147</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/modern/NancyKellerman/direct_actioncatsm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamaicaplaingazette.com/node/2719&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
By DAVID TABER - &lt;em&gt;Jamaica Plain Gazette,&lt;/em&gt;            May 2, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
SOUTH
ST.—Two workers who were fired from the Jamaica Plain store of Harvest
Co-op Markets in the last six months claim they were terminated for
expressing support for union organizing efforts at the nonprofit
supermarket. Harvest denies their accusations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Diego Bencosme and Deon Furtick had both worked at Harvest for
close to four years. They were both fired for failing to punch out when
they went off shift—a rule they claim was rarely, if ever, enforced
during their tenures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They were fired without prior warnings, they said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both say they were fired because of their support for a current
effort by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to organize at
Harvest. Both have filed complaints with the National Labor Relations
Board.

 <title>Harvest Co-op fired worker, a union backer</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4001</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/modern/NancyKellerman/direct_actioncatsm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bridgenews.org/bridge_news/032008/harvest-co-op-fired-worker-a-union-backer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;By
&lt;/span&gt;
Bill Bumpus - &lt;em&gt;The Bridge&lt;/em&gt;, March 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deon Furtick, 31, of
Roxbury, and a father of three, had worked for four years in the deli
at the Jamaica Plain store at 57 South St. He was fired for not
punching out for a meal break on January 8th.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Furtick
had never punched out for meal breaks, and had never been told this was
necessary. He did not suspect his job was in jeopardy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Harvest Manager of Operations Marc Cutler used to be Jamaica Plain
store manager. There he had personally signed off on employees’ hours
every week. So he would have noticed that Furtick did not punch out on
his breaks.
&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Boston: Actions in Support of Starbucks Baristas and Farmers</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3107</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/IU660/sbux/sb1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;This Thursday, December 21, Boston locals took action in support of Starbucks baristas and farmers. Workers with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and students set up a table near a Starbucks just outside of Boston with information on fair trade, the IWW, and Starbucks&#039; anti-worker and anti-union practices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Starbucks has made every effort to keep workers in the United States (specifically New York City) from organizing, including firing workers for their union activity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We spoke with a number of employees who were very interested and receptive, in fact all of the workers we talked to were with the exception of a woman who asserted that she was part of the CWA (in the AFL-CIO). We had a discussion with one worker when he got off work about why he thinks unions are important and the Haymarket martyrs. A large IWW flag was held high above the street and students sang union songs together from both sides of the road We also had a lengthy discussion with a woman working across the road who is a former Starbucks barista and who strongly agreed with our action. After a while we moved to a different Starbucks down the street and continued. More actions are planned in the area soon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; more information at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starbucksunion.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.starbucksunion.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Starbucks Solidarity Night in Boston a success!</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2851</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;289&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/photos/color/events/IMG_0981.JPG&quot; /&gt;The Boston IWW raised $380 for the Starbucks Workers Union in the first of a series of planned IWW Solidarity Nights. Solidarity for Fellow Workers, great music and food&amp;nbsp;was what it was all about. The benefit had a great turnout despite a last minute change in venue. In between act&amp;nbsp;FW&#039;s from our branch spoke to the crowd about&amp;nbsp;what is going on with the campaign and&amp;nbsp;the fired Baristas.&amp;nbsp;The word&amp;nbsp;defiantly got out to the community&amp;nbsp;of the continuing assault on&amp;nbsp;Starbucks workers by the company. The event was held on September 9th at the Zeitgeist Gallery in Cambridge, and featured performance&#039;s by &lt;strong&gt;Dieselhorse&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Evan Greer&lt;/strong&gt;(The riot folk Collective), &lt;strong&gt;Jake and the Infernal Machine&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Clara Hendricks&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bill Bumpus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Harvey&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2851&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Appeal for Solidarity from Boston IWW Member</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/2393</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/graphics/agitators/modern/others/solidarityforever1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Hi there.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My name is Sara Willig.&amp;nbsp; I am a member of the Boston GMB.&amp;nbsp; You might remember me if you followed the DARE job branch struggles of 2002-4.&amp;nbsp; The situation I&amp;rsquo;m writing you about tonight is &amp;nbsp;related to that fight, when my coworkers voted to decertify the union about 18 months ago after a campaign of union busting and manipulation by management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;rsquo;t follow the DARE job branch situation, or if you&amp;rsquo;ve joined more recently, I&amp;rsquo;m a health care worker.&amp;nbsp; I do a social work job, but without a degree in social work or the higher wages that go along with that degree.&amp;nbsp; Keeps the price down for you, the taxpayer, never mind the State.&amp;nbsp; But mostly it keeps the costs down for the boss.&amp;nbsp; The agency I work for contracts with Massachusetts&amp;rsquo; Dept, of Mental Retardation (DMR) and I&amp;rsquo;m paid to be the case manager for two disabled people.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ve had a caseload of three people. Currently my clients are borderline MR and moderately MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/2393&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
