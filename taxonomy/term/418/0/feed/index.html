 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/4588</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;1.why did you decide to messenger?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;I
guess I decided to messenger for the same reason as most. I was living
in New Orleans at the time, and was about to lose my job. One day I was
hanging out downtown trying to figure out what to do with myself. A
bike messenger cut through an intersection, and I thought to myself
“that looks like a pretty cool job.” I went down to the only company
that was hiring, and started working the next day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2.when did you start?  has the time been on/off or straight?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/IU540/chicago/107_0733.jpg&quot; /&gt;It is with profound sadness that I write to tell you all that FW Ryan Boudreau (pictured, right, on the right), a bicycle messenger in the Chicago Couriers Union (IU 540),  was killed on the job yesterday.&amp;nbsp; He was struck by a northbound truck at  the intersection of 18th and S. Clark streets at about 3:15 yesterday afternoon.&amp;nbsp; The newspaper reports that it was ruled an accident by  the police.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;div&gt;I don&#039;t have too many details yet, but the CCU Secretary wrote to tell me that he and several other CCU members and supporters are  planning a general meeting Wednesday evening to plan actions surrounding Ryan&#039;s  death and will hold a memorial ride.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;FW Boudreau was a dedicated member of the IWW and the CCU and fought for an end to NICA  and the anti-courier regulations at 135 S Lasalle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We will keep the rest of you posted with information as it  develops.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3578&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Chicago Couriers Union takes action downtown, Part 1</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/3404</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;255&quot; height=&quot;248&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/graphics/IU540/chicago/107_0733.jpg&quot; /&gt;Wednesday, May 2nd, 2007 - At 11am, the Chicago Couriers Union (IWW, IU540) rolled up to 135 South LaSalle Street (between Monroe and Adams) with, signs, fliers, and union flags for a spirited 3-hour informational picket against the security policies of the building, which is managed by Jones Lang LaSalle. Last fall, union members had written letters and had over 100 bike messengers sign a petition, in hopes of having the policy changed and to have a messenger center installed, only to be given the run-around by building management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this and many other buildings downtown, messengers must endure humiliating and time-consuming security procedures to simply do their jobs: entering through a loading dock, leaving their bags (as if they&#039;re criminals), and waiting for a freight elevator (rather than just taking passenger elevators through the lobby), and often taking abuse from security guards. Forcing messengers into this mess can take 15-20 minutes, costs customers money, costs messengers money, results in a loss of productivity across the industry, and is just plain Not Cool with most bikers working downtown, who are paid on commission per delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two messengers held the picket for its duration, and several fellow messengers, plus a member of the local IWW General Membership Branch, spent time holding signs and handing out fliers to fellow workers, employees in the building, and other passersby. The picket covered the front and back entrances, plus both entrances of the alley leading into the loading dock. Hundreds of fliers were distributed, containing information about the grievance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/3404&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
