 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Sky Barsch - &lt;em&gt;Barre Montpelier Times-Argus&lt;/em&gt;, July 20, 2005&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/files/images/CitywideLogo_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; - The following article is reposted here because it covers an IWW campaign.&amp;nbsp; The views of the author and the publisher do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONTPELIER &amp;mdash; Several members of the now-defunct Montpelier Downtown Workers&#039; Union are reorganizing under a new name and are affiliating with a new union.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some 25 to 30 Montpelier workers who were formerly members of the Montpelier Downtown Workers&#039; Union, which was affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, are resurrecting themselves as a branch of the Industrial Workers of the World, according to a written statement from the newly named Montpelier Workers Union.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Montpelier Downtown Workers Union was an effort to organize the capital city&#039;s retail and food-service workers. It officially called it quits earlier this summer, blaming high turnover and strong employer resistance as the reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Montpelier Workers Union Steward Diana Duke, who works at Champlain Farms, said she hopes the new union will have 50 members and new contracts signed with shops by the first snowfall. She declined to say what stores the union had targeted for contracts. She said &amp;quot;pretty extravagant things&amp;quot; would be happening soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/1152&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Montpelier Workers Join IWW</title>
 <link>https://www.iww.org/node/1150</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/files/images/CitywideLogo_1.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Montpelier, July 18&lt;/strong&gt; - Dozens of Montpelier workers, formerly members of the MDWU (UE Local 221) are reorganizing their union into an Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) Local. Our union will now be organizing workers not only in the downtown, but also throughout the capital region. To reflect this expansion of our organizing scope, our union will now be known as the &amp;quot;Montpelier Workers Union.&amp;quot; This union is no longer affiliated with the United Electrical Workers or the Vermont Workers&#039; Center. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Our decision to merge with the IWW is based in part by the fact that this union has been organizing similar geographic unions throughout the continent for the past three years. In Philadelphia, the South Street Workers Union claims hundreds of supporters, and dues paying members in a many different city shops. In Wisconsin the Madison Downtown Workers Union is currently organizing across the city much like in Montpelier. We look forward to being in the same international labor union as these like-minded organizations. We intend on learning from each other, and therefore emerging as a strong and united voice of working people throughout Vermont, the U.S. and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iww.org/node/1150&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
