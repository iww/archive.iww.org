<p><strong>By x344543.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. Introduction</strong> -&nbsp; For over two decades, many IWW Branches have set up literature / merchandise tables at various events. This guide has been developed through experience, mostly trial and error) and observation.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>II. Why Table? Goals:</strong></p>
<p>(A) Grow the IWW by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Interest perspective members in joining the IWW;</li>
<li>(2) Serve as a contact point for organizing leads;</li>
<li>(3) Build your local IWW network of support contacts;</li>
<li>(4) Increase our visibility (plants the seeds for future growth);</li>
<li>(5) Network with other, similar organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>(B) Raise funds for your IWW Branch:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Sale of IWW merchandise;</li>
<li>(2) Collecting donations;</li>
<li>(3) Signing up new members;</li>
<li>(4) Collecting union dues from current members.</li>
</ul>
<p>(C) Educate / Propagandize:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Sale of IWW literature;</li>
<li>(2) Distribute free IWW literature;</li>
<li>(3) Spread news of current campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p>(D) Provide activity / experience for current members.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>III. What typically goes on an IWW Table:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>(A) Merchandise (you can order much of this from the <a href="http://store.iww.org/" target="_blank">IWW&nbsp;Literature Department</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Apparel: IWW T-shirts and IWW Hats mostly;</li>
<li>(2) Books, Pamphlets, and Songbooks;</li>
<li>(3) Music (CDs mostly);</li>
<li>(4) Posters;</li>
<li>(5) Trinkets (buttons, patches, stickers, pennants, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>(B) Free Literature</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) <em>Industrial Worker</em>;</li>
<li>(2) Leaflets (especially about current campaigns).</li>
</ul>
<p>(C) Networking Tools</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) IWW Business Cards (crucial - helps others contact us later);</li>
<li>(2) <a href="../../..//PDF/Forms/Generic%20Supporters%20Sign-Up%20Form.pdf">Local IWW Contact Signup Form</a> (on a clipboard with pens; also crucial).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IV. Tabling Equipment </strong>- These are the essential tools for setting up an IWW literature table. Sometimes one or more pieces of this equipment are available at the tabling site and we needn&rsquo;t supply them ourselves. It is useful to know in advance what may or may not be available on site:</p>
<p>(A) Tables - For example, the Bay Area IWW has at least three easy to set up / dismantle, compact roll-up tables that measure 4-feet square.&nbsp; These can be purchased from sporting / camping goods stores;</p>
<p>(B) Tablecloth - the table tops get dirty and dusty, plus the table cloth makes the merchandise look more appealing;</p>
<p>(C) IWW Banner(s) - Helps people identify us up close and from a distance;</p>
<p>(D) Clipboards and Pens (for the signup sheets, people who wish to sign up, people who wish to pay dues, or people who wish to pay by personal check);</p>
<p>(E) Canopy (optional) - For events that take place outside, a camping tent that is 8 or 10 feet square and is easy to set-up and take down is a good additional piece of equipment. This is useful in both sun (it provides shade) and rain (it provides <em>some</em> shelter). There are also tent stakes for windy sites with soft ground;</p>
<p>(F) Rubber Bands (helps if there is wind);</p>
<p>(G) Poster Frames - for displaying posters;</p>
<p>(H) Storage Containers for merchandise;</p>
<p>(I) Modular Storage Cubes (optional) - easy to set up / take down, compact, provides additional surface area and can enhance the display.&nbsp; These can be purchased from office supply or container stores;</p>
<p>(J) Bungee Cords - useful for hanging IWW banners and, or holding the legs of the canopy to a tree or other permanent object;</p>
<p>(K) Chairs (optional) for seating;</p>
<p>(L) About $25 in small bills - many of our items cost between $10-$15, some cost less. Most people have $20 bills, because those are (still) what ATMs usually dispense;</p>
<p>(M) Price List - There should be a price list with the merchandise.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>V. Preparation for Tabling:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>(A) Research the Event:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) <strong>WHAT</strong> - Know what the event is, and if the IWW can table at the event; contact the event organizers and ask permission if uncertain. Sometimes there is a tabling free, either payable in advance or at the event itself;</li>
<li>(2) <strong>WHERE</strong> - Research the location, including exactly where the tables will go;</li>
<li>(3) <strong>WHEN</strong> - Know the time and date as well as the duration of the event;</li>
<li>(4) <strong>WHO</strong> - Try to figure how many people might attend (it is usually not worth the effort if the event will be small, unless it is directly related to the IWW);</li>
<li>(5) <strong>WHY</strong> - Determine whether or not it is worth the effort; usually, if the event is likely to draw 100 or more and last an hour or more, it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>(B) Line Up Volunteers to Assist (you can table on your own, but it is always better to have at least another person for several reasons:&nbsp; safety, logistics, bathroom / food breaks, company, busy periods):</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Announce the event in advance (on your local IWW email lists, Facebook page, iww.org web calendar):</li>
<li>(2) Contact your perspective volunteers;</li>
<li>(3) Arrange to pick up the merchandise or have it delivered;</li>
<li>(4) Arrange transportation of the merchandise / equipment;</li>
<li>(5) Ensure that you have all of your necessary equipment / merchandise.</li>
</ul>
<p>(C) Scout the Location if unfamiliar:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Note potential table location sites;</li>
<li>(2) Be aware of parking availability, regulations, and/or fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>(D) Plan your day in advance (including meal breaks if necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
<strong>VI. Set Up:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>(A) Gather Equipment / Merchandise in advance - It is advisable to pick up the equipment at least a day in advance of the event.</p>
<p>(B) Arrive at the event site early - Make sure your fellow tabling volunteers do so too (at least those assisting with the set up). Set up usually takes about 30 - 60 minutes. Be ready by the official start time of the event.</p>
<p>(C) Be prepared - Anything can happen. Parking may be less available than expected; weather can change suddenly; tabling sites may be scarce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VII. Tabling Itself (the good stuff!) </strong>- This is where the fun begins!</p>
<p>(A) Layout - Make sure the merchandise / literature / outreach tools are neat, organized, and well displayed. For T-shirts, keep them stacked neatly and organized by size (small on top is best) This makes a huge difference;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) Entropy - Throughout the event, especially busy events, the display gets disorganized. Periodically straighten it up;</p>
<p>(C) Interaction - Of course, be friendly, energetic, engaging with people who approach you.</p>
<p>(D) Network - Encourage people to put their contact information on your signup list. This helps build the IWW&rsquo;s network of support and can potentially result in new members / organizing leads.</p>
<p>(E) Keep track of the money - Keep it organized and safe. Be prepared to get change if needed. Sometimes this means you have to go to a bank, store, or eatery and ask for change.</p>
<p>(F) Avoid Confrontation - political events attract no shortage of people with strong opinions or people who may be, for lack of a better word, crazy. Friendly debate is useful; energy sucking confrontation is not and it drives others away from the table.</p>
<p>(G) Watch Out for Theft - it rarely happens, but sometimes people do take things without paying. More often than that, sometimes people walk away with an item without thinking about it (an honest mistake).</p>
<p>(H) Weather - Outdoor events are subject to changes in weather. Heavy rain is pretty rare (usually outdoor events don&rsquo;t take place in the rainy season), but it can happen. Rain can destroy books and paper. Wind is more of a problem. Sometimes sudden gusts of wind can blow paper, books, t-shirts, money, even whole camping canopies several feet away. Be prepared for this.</p>
<p>(I) Space on the Table - Occasionally people will walk by the table and ask us to let them leave leaflets for their event, organization, cause at our table. Use your judgment in deciding this. Usually it&rsquo;s okay if their literature is small, like a quarter-sheet and the event somewhat relevant to the IWW, but don&rsquo;t sacrifice our own display for this. Also, it can become inundating if large numbers of people ask for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>VIII. Extra Good Ideas </strong>- This can really help make the most of tabling:</p>
<p>(A) Delegates - It is ideal if at least one member of the tabling crew is a delegate (in fact, if you are taking this training seriously, you should consider being a delegate; it will allow you to collect dues from current members as well as sign up new members);</p>
<p>(B) Work the Crowd - If you have an especially large crew and it is an especially large event (such as a book fair, large demonstration, say 10,000 or more), it might be useful to have some volunteers stand near the table, distributing a leaflet or postcard relevant to current IWW activity and have them draw people to our table (this is something we rarely do, but should try more often).</p>
<p>(C) Write a brief report of the experience when finished - These can be useful as news items, for the IWW website, <em>Industrial Worker</em>, and/or branch reports, and it will inspire others to get involved. Be sure to note how much money was raised.</p>
<p>(D) Look for the Union Label - Make note of the fact that much of what we sell is union made / printed. People appreciate this.</p>
<p>(E) Be Familiar with the Merchandise / Literature - This helps sell it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IX. Parking&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(A) Budget for parking fees;</p>
<p>(B) Have a discretionary fund for parking fees; or</p>
<p>(C)&nbsp;Save your receipts and ask your IWW Branch to recompense you for parking expenses.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>X. Takedown </strong>- As the event winds down, be sure to dismantle and store all equipment / merchandise carefully and neatly.</p>
<p>(A) Merchandise / Literature / Networking Equipment - Stow all of these things neatly in their storage containers;</p>
<p>(B) Equipment - Dismantle everything carefully and methodically. We want our equipment to last a long time;</p>
<p>(C) Money - Count the money and Checks and make note of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(D) Sign Up Sheets - Collect and keep track of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>XII. Return and Process:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>(A) Return Tabling Equipment / Merchandise</p>
<p>(B) Deliver Money to the your IWW Branch Treasurer</p>
<p>(C) Deliver Outreach / Contact Sheets to your IWW Branch Outreach Coordinator</p>
<p>(D) Relax - Good Job Fellow Workers!</p> <div id="book-navigation-6698" class="book-navigation">
