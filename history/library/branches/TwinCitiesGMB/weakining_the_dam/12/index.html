<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 1 and 2 &ndash;</span> Campaign membership: 2 Number of organizers: 2</p>
<p>You and your fellow branch members attend an IWW basic organizer training, some of us like to call it the &ldquo;Build the Committee&rdquo; training, others call it the &ldquo;101&Prime; training.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 5 &ndash; </span>You hold a small group meeting to pick a target. You do some preparation before the meeting, put your thoughts in writing and bring them to the meeting. If you can&rsquo;t geta group together, you write up a plan on your own and you call someone in the branch and outside the branch to talk it over. (If the plan is to organize your own workplace you can skip to day 15, though you should still have the discussions with the branch. Also, you should always have a partner to organize with if at all possible. Flying solo as an organizer is a bad idea.) You make a plan to track the necessary information &ndash; contact sheets, spreadsheets/database, file cabinet, binder, whatever works for you.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 7 &ndash;</span> You email the to IWW email list, write a post on the members only web forums, call your GEB contact, and call your ODB contact to find out who else in the IWW works in or is organizing in this industry/company</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 14 &ndash;</span> You hold an open meeting with anyone from branch who wants to attend. You present your plan and target. All of you have a discussion about needed roles and assign tasks. People aren&rsquo;t as enthusiastic as you had hoped, but you still feel pretty fired up.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
Day 15 through 45 &ndash;</span> You do research about your target online. You ask the people listed under Day 7 to help you with this. You also gathering contacts and social mapping as we talked about in the Organizer Training. You also focus on relationship building at work. You take good notes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 46 &ndash;</span> You have a complete or almost complete contact list. You&rsquo;ve talked to people outside your branch and people in your branch. You begin one on one meetings with your coworkers. You&rsquo;re a serious organizer, so you aim to do at least 3 conversations per week. You&rsquo;re a realist, so you expect to succeed in 1/3 of these. You decide to do these for the next 10 weeks or until you have a group of at least 10 people who are willing to attend an organizer training. You think to yourself, if people are unwilling to attend a 2 day training then you should not trust them with your and your co-workers&rsquo; jobs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 67 &ndash;</span> Campaign membership: 5 Number of organizers: 2</p>
<p>You hold a group new member orientation to the IWW for the people in the campaign who have joined up. You invite people from the branch to attend as well. Only some of them do. This annoys you. A few co-workers don&rsquo;t show up, this hurts your feelings. Those of you who are there have an awesome conversation about work and IWW vision. This excited you. Some new members can&rsquo;t attend the orientation as a group so you make a plan to get them oriented individually. You contact your GEB rep, ODB rep, and someone from the OTC to help you with orientation materials and curriculum, because your branch doesn&rsquo;t already have this stuff.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 98 &ndash;</span> Campaign membership: 8 Number of organizers: 2</p>
<p>You hold another new member orientation. You invite people who have already been to one to attend and help facilitate discussion. Some new members can&rsquo;t attend the orientation as a group so you make a plan to get them oriented individually.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 116 and 117 -</span> Sympathetic but inactive supporters: 20 Campaign membership: 12<br />
Number of organizers: 2 Number of delegates: 1 Officers: Treasurer</p>
<p>You host another organizer training. Some people have scheduling difficulties such as childcare needs, so your branch pays for childcare for them so they can attend. Some people have scheduling difficulties that you can&rsquo;t get around, like medical appointments, so you make a plan to catch them up on the content as best as you can. You decide to hold a 4 hour session later that focuses on A-E-I-O-U like the first part of the training. You ask the Organizer Training Committee and the Organizing Department Board to help you with this. They do. The training ends with a session where you create your plan to win, including immediate next steps and a timeline for the next piece of your campaign&rsquo;s plan. Your plan is awesome. You aim to have a committee equal to 15% of the total workforce at your target, and supporters equal to 65%. You don&rsquo;t get to cover all the details of how to get there so you set a date for a follow up meeting in two week&rsquo;s time. At this meeting you do social mapping, among other things, and push people to use the training. You emphasize talking to key workplace leaders and build a list of them by name/identifying information (&ldquo;the one on nights who wears the Sox hat&rdquo;). You know that workplace leaders are harder to move. You expect to succeed 1/5 of the time. Talk to all the identified leaders first before repeating a conversation with a leader who says no or isn&rsquo;t sure.</p>
<p>You identify one member of the organizing committee who is very organized personally, this person becomes your first delegate. You convince that person to start thinking about money. You start to get other members of the organizing committee to turn in receipts to the delegate. You have the delegate turn the receipts into the branch treasurer. You make sure they report at every meeting on the financial state of the organizing drive &ndash; giving a report on the bank balance, and an account of how much dues was taken in and expenses.</p>
<p>*From this point on you will begin to act like the experienced lead organizer who supports and pushes your coworker organizers. You also set a goal of making each of your campaign&rsquo;s key wobbly organizers train two or three more people to be committed and capable wobbly organizers just like yourselves. You use the checklists that accompany this timeline, and you give out copies of this pamphlet. You set up follow conversations with people to see what they thought of the pamphlet.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 118 &ndash;</span> You begin to debrief individually with everyone who attended the training. You begin one on ones with workplace leaders. Everyone at the training begins to have 3 conversations per week. With leaders, you expect 1/5 of these conversations to succeed. Since there are other areas of the workplace where you don&rsquo;t have leaders identified, you begin outreach to other workers in these areas, in order to identify leaders. You push everyone to do these conversations. You really expect only half of the people to do so, but it still bothers you that not everyone does this. You begin to have short role plays at your committee meetings as part of reportbacks on how the one on ones are going.</p>
<p>*You make your own personal plan on how you will individually train the workplace leaders on organizing and how you will help them build relationships to other IWW members. You make this a central piece of your own work.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 138 - </span>Sympathetic but inactive supporters: 30 Campaign membership: 22<br />
Number of organizers: 5 Leaders involved: 2 Number of Delegates: 2 Officers: Treasurer, Secretary</p>
<p>The core organizers in the campaign are beginning to get tired. You hold a committee meeting to discuss how the individual conversations are going. You layout a plan to win including a campaign timeline. A few people come to the meeting who are not doing the individual conversations. Aa few people who are doing at least some individual conversations don&rsquo;t come. This bothers you, but you&rsquo;re fired up to see so many people working on the campaign. At this meeting you discuss difficulties people are having in their conversations with co-workers and brainstorm solutions. You set goals for continuing conversations.</p>
<p>You start spreading paperwork around in order to take administrative workload off of organizers. Your group elects another delegate to collect dues. The group decides to turn the previous delegate into the campaign treasurer. The group gets its own bank account and gives both delegates signing authority on the account. The new delegate becomes a campaign secretary, the secretary will take care of reporting to the branch on the progress of the campaign and fielding any questions from people not directly in the campaign. Both officers agree to report every month, with the campaign secretary reporting on membership and communications from people and groups outside the campaign and the treasurer continuing financial reports.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
Day 152 - </span>Sympathetic but inactive supporters: 35 Campaign membership: 30<br />
Number of organizers: 4 Leaders involved: 4 Number of Delegates: 2<br />
Officers: Treasurer, Secretary</p>
<p>Your original core co-organizers burns out and quietly leaves campaign. If your branch is functioning well and reaches out to them, they stay around. If the branch is not functioning well, they drop out and possibly quit the union. Your campaign is at a big point now! After about five months, you&rsquo;re having a meeting to plan your first action. You talked to people around the union and did a lot of thought ahead of time so you arrive with a plan. You wanted to make sure, in case the group didn&rsquo;t have any ideas or any good ideas but you sill engage everyone in a group brainstorm and discussion to plan together. The plan that the group comes up with is awesome. Your doing a march on the boss. The group lays out roles and people take assignments. You all check in to see who is doing their one on one conversations. You help anyone who is struggling, by having a role play and brainstorming.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 154 &ndash;</span> You check in that everyone did their part for the action</p>
<p>D<span style="font-weight:bold">ay 155 &ndash;</span> Action. You march on the boss. You scare the hell out of the boss. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 157 &ndash; </span>You hold a meeting to respond to management&rsquo;s response to the action, if<br />
necessary.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 166 -</span> Sympathetic but inactive supporters: 50 Campaign membership: 35<br />
Number of organizers: 5 Leaders involved: 5 Number of Delegates: 3 Officers: Treasurer, Secretary</p>
<p>Your new organizers begin to get tired. One campaign member (preferably a workplace leader) that you have been working with begins to act like an organizer. The group elects one more delegate. You make a motion at the branch meeting to make sure the branch is training new delegates in how to report.</p>
<p>You have a big group meeting with everyone who is involved in the campaign. You hype your victories, discuss work issues to agitate people, assess campaign and lay out social map so far, lay out the plan to win, set goals, give assignments, and set deadlines. You check in to see who is doing their one on one conversations. You help anyone who is struggling, by having a role play and brainstorming. All of you continue conversations with co-workers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 168 &ndash;</span> You hold a new member orientation to the IWW for the people in the campaign who have joined up. You get the branch to do this, not the organizer(s). The organizers handle turnout, not running the orientation or getting a space etc. You set a date or set the wheels in motion to set a date. You start working on turnout as soon as date and time and place are figured out.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 180 -</span> Sympathetic but inactive supporters: 55 Campaign membership: 40<br />
Number of organizers: 3 Leaders involved: 7 Number of Delegates: 3<br />
Officers: Treasurer, Secretary</p>
<p>Two of the new organizers burn out and quietly leave campaign. If the branch is functioning well, they have had an IWW orientation and people in the branch reach out to them, they stay around. If the branch is not functioning well, they drop out and possibly quit the union.</p>
<p>You hold a committee meeting. The committee plans a shorter organizer training focusing on key skills, to increase the number of organizers involved. (Either one 4 hour session or two 2 hour sessions.) You also have each organizer pick two coworkers to target to teach how to organize on an individual basis by involving them in small group conversation, debriefing, and covering the basics. You prioritize turning workplace leaders into organizers. The group also elects two of the campaign&rsquo;s experienced organizers to attend the upcoming union-wide Training for Trainers, so the campaign can do better at trainings. You&rsquo;re one of the people elected. Then the meeting shifts gears. You discuss how the individual conversations are going and how to do turn out for the shorter organizer training. A few people are at the meeting who are not doing the individual conversation. A few people who are doing at least some individual conversations don&rsquo;t come to the meeting</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Day 194 &ndash; </span>Shorter training</p>
<p>*From this point on the organizers who have been around will begin to act like the experienced lead organizer who supports and pushes their coworker organizers. You will need to help them with this role and push them to really do it.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
Day 195 - </span>Sympathetic but inactive supporters: 60 Campaign membership: 45<br />
Number of organizers: 8 Leaders involved: 10 Number of Delegates: 4<br />
Officers: Treasurer, Secretary</p>
<p>You begin to debrief with everyone who was at the training. You celebrate victories, agitate on issues, push the plan to win. Everyone continues to talk with coworkers. The group elects one more delegate, preferably from your pool of good organizers. You submit the bylaws you have been working on with a membership list put together by the secretary and the delegates to General Headquarters and petition for an Industrial Union Branch charter. Once you have this charter you need to hold a meeting and brainstorm what is going to be handled by the GMB and what is going to be handled by the Industrial Union Branch. Ideally the GMB handles solidarity work with other unions and allied causes, new member orientation, and organizer training. The IUB handles building the campaign, keeping members caught up on their dues and social and educational events for workers in the industry.</p>
<p>You talk to the Organizer Training Committee schedule a version of the OTC&rsquo;s Committee In Action advanced training, also known as the &ldquo;Organizing 102&Prime; training. You schedule an IUB strategy and planning retreat for two weeks after that training.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
