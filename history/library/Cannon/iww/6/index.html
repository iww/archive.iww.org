<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>There was no such thing as &ldquo;full employment&rdquo; in the time of the IWW. The economic cycle ran its normal ten-year course, with its periodic crises and depressions, producing a surplus labor army squeezed out of industry in the East. Unemployment rose and fell with the turns of the cycle, but was always a permanent feature of the times. An economic crisis in 1907 and a serious depression in 1913-1914 swelled the army of the jobless.</p>
<p>Many of the unemployed workers, especially the young, took to the road, as those of another generation were to do again in the Thirties. The developing West had need of a floating labor force, and the supply drifted toward the demand. A large part of the mobile labor population in the West at that time, perhaps a majority, originated in the eastern half of the continent. Their conditions of life were pretty rough.</p>
<p>They were not the most decisive section of the working class; that resided, then as now, in the industrial centers of the eastern half of the continent. But these migrants, wherever they came from, responded most readily to the IWW program for a drastic change in the social order.</p>
<p>The IWW was right at home among footloose workers who found casual employment in the harvest fields &mdash; traveling by freight train to follow the ripening of the grain, then back by freight train again to the transportation centers for any kind of work they could find there; railroad construction workers, shipping out for temporary jobs and then shipping back to the cities into unemployment again; lumberjacks, metal miners, seamen, etc., who lived in insecurity and worked, when they worked, under the harshest, most primitive conditions.</p>
<p>This narrow stratum of the unsettled and least privileged workers came to make up the bulk of the membership of the IWW. It was often said among the Wobblies, only half facetiously, that the name of their organization, &ldquo;Industrial Workers of the World,&rdquo; should be changed to &lsquo;Migratory Workers of the World.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American political system offered no place for the participation of this floating labor force of the expanding West. Very little provision of any kind was made for them. They were overlooked in the whole scheme of things. They lacked the residential qualifications to vote in elections and enjoyed few of the rights of political democracy accorded to settled citizens with a stake in their community. They were the dispossessed, the homeless outcasts, without roots or a stake any place in society, and with nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Since they had no right to vote anyway, it took little argument to persuade them that &ldquo;political action&rdquo; &mdash; at the ballot box was a delusion and a snare. They had already been convinced, by their own harsh experiences, that it would take more than paper ballots to induce the exploiters to surrender their swollen privileges. The IWW, with its bold and sweeping program of revolution by direct action, spoke their language and they heard it gladly.</p>
<p>The IWW became for them their one all-sufficient organization &mdash; their union and their party; their social center; their home; their family; their school; and in a manner of speaking, their religion, without the supernatural trimmings &mdash; the faith they lived by. Some of Joe Hill&rsquo;s finest songs, it should be remembered, were derisive parodies of the religious hymns of the IWW&rsquo;s rivals in the fight for the souls of the migratory workers milling around in the congested Skid Row sections of the western and mid-western cities.</p>
<p>These were not the derelicts who populate the present day version of the old Skid Row. For the greater part, they were the young and venturesome, who had been forced out of the main industries in more settled communities, or had wandered away from them in search of opportunity and adventure. They had been badly bruised and beaten, but not conquered. They had the courage and the will to fight for an alleviation of their own harsh conditions.</p>
<p>But when they enlisted in the IWW it meant far more to them than joining a union to promote a picayune program of immediate personal needs. The IWW proclaimed that by solidarity they could win everything. It gave them a vision of a new world and inspired them to fight for the general good of the whole working class.</p>
<p>These footloose workers, recruited by the propaganda and action of the IWW, became the carriers of its great, profoundly simple message wherever they traveled &mdash; the message expressed in the magic words: Solidarity, Workers&rsquo; Power, One Big Union and Workers&rsquo; Emancipation. Wherever they went, they affirmed their conviction that &ldquo;there is power in a band of working men,&rdquo; as stated in the singing words of Joe Hill &mdash; &ldquo;a power that must rule in every land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They felt themselves to be &mdash; as indeed they were &mdash; the advance guard of an emancipating army. But it was an advance guard separated from the main body of troops in concentrated industry, separated and encircled, and compelled to wage guerrilla actions while awaiting reinforcements from the main army of the proletariat in the East. It was a singing movement, with confidence in its mission. When the Wobblies sang out the swelling chorus of &ldquo;Hold the Fort,&rdquo; they &ldquo;heard the bugles blow&rdquo; and really believed that &ldquo;by our union we shall triumph over every foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recruits enlisted in the main from this milieu soon came to make up the main cadres of the IWW; to provide its shock troops in all Its battles, East and West; and to impress their own specific ideology upon it &mdash; the ideology which was in part &lsquo;he developed result of their own experiences, and in part derived from teachings of the IWW. These teachings seemed to formulate and systematize their own tendencies. That&rsquo;s why they accepted them so readily.</p>
<p>Many a worker recruited to the IWW under those conditions was soon on the move again, carrying his red card and his newly found convictions with him and transmitting them to others. All the progressive and radical sections of the labor movement were heavily influenced by the IWW in the years preceding the First World War.</p>
<p>The left-wing socialists were ardent sympathizers of the IWW, and quite a few of them were members. The same was true in large measure of the more militant trade unionists in the AFL. &ldquo;Two-card men&rdquo; were fairly numerous &mdash; those who belonged to the AFL unions for bread and butter reasons and carried the &ldquo;red card&rdquo; of the IWW for the sake of principle.</p>
<p>The IWW struck a spark in the heart of youth as no other movement in this country, before or since, has done. Young idealists from &ldquo;the winds&rsquo; four quarters&rdquo; came to the IWW and gave it all they had. The movement had its gifted strike leaders, organizers and orators, its poets and its martyrs.</p>
<p>By the accumulated weight of its unceasing propagandistic efforts, and by the influence of its heroic actions on many occasions which were sensationally publicized, the IWW eventually permeated a whole generation of American radicals, of all shades and affiliations, with its concept of industrial unionism as the best form for the organization of workers&rsquo; power and its program for a revolutionary settlement of the class struggle.</p>
<p>It was a long way from the pioneer crusade of the IWW among the dispossessed migratory workers on the western frontier, in the second decade of our century, to the invincible picket lines and sit-down strikes of the mass production workers in the eastern centers of concentrated industry, in the Thirties. A long way and not a straight one. But that&rsquo;s the route over which the message of industrial unionism eventually reached those places where it was most applicable and could eventually explode with the greatest power.</p>
