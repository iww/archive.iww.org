<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 05/23/2012 - 9:42pm</p>
<p><b><a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2012/05/16/may-1st-in-the-twin-cities/" target="_blank">By Elijah Marks - <i>The Organizer</i> May 16, 2012</a></b><br />
<br /><img src="../../../sites/default/files/images/576620_452464564780014_290704900955982_1754036_1563455071_n.preview.jpg" align="right" />
The celebration of International Workers&rsquo; Day in the Twin Cities brought together many groups organizing around various struggles. The resurgent Occupy movement has injected new energy into the holiday.<br />
<br />
Local organizing coalesced in an Occupy May 1st Twin Cities group, planning for a day of action around &lsquo;no work, no school&rsquo; and a &lsquo;day without the 99%&rsquo; For months leading up to the action, they met weekly at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)&rsquo;s office to coordinate with other groups, plan events for the day, and make and spread posters and leaflets.<br />
<br />
The mutual aid ethos of the wider Occupy movement was demonstrated through Occuprint, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street in New York City, who helped with May 1st publicity in the Twin Cities&mdash;and other cities across the country&mdash;by distributing hundreds of high-quality, large-format posters and newspapers. Additionally, local designers created their own innovative designs, such as the following poster:<br />
<br />
Another form of circulation of common media across the country was a zine with an illustrated history of May Day. During the meet-up at the beginning of the day, I found this zine to be a useful means for meeting new people and sparking conversations. Talking about this history made us feel connected with the tradition of struggle for immigrants&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; rights, such as the 8-hour workday, that most people take for granted, and seeing that nothing will be gained&mdash;and much could be lost&mdash;without continued militant struggle.<br />

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 05/22/2012 - 7:57pm</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWPatch1.png" />The International Solidarity Commission of the Industrial Workers of the World condemns the actions taken by the Mossos d'Esquadra, Catalonia police. Laura G&oacute;mez, the General Secretary of CGT-Barcelona was arrested by the Mossos d'Esquadra for trumped up charges that have no basis in fact. It is obvious that this is nothing more than an act of repression and intimidation in response to the growing workers' mobilizations in Spain. We demand the immediate release of Laura G&oacute;mez and the withdrawal of all charges.</p>
<p>We are in solidarity with, and commend, the CGT-Barcelona, Laura G&oacute;mez, and the rest of Spain's working class for their ongoing struggle against police repression and labour injustice.</p>
<p>Solidarity Forever, <br />
International Solidarity Commission <br />

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 04/24/2012 - 8:12pm</p>
<p><b><img align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWdrawing.smlr.preview.gif" alt="" />Whereas</b> increasing numbers of working class and dispossessed people in the United States have begun to meet face to face to proclaim their opposition to economic injustice and define their interests in democratic popular assemblies, autonomous from political parties, as part of the Occupy Movement, which resonates deeply with the IWW's traditions and principles, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> millions of working class and dispossessed people around the world, but especially in Northern Africa and Western Asia, have been organizing themselves to overthrow the governments that enforce the capitalist and neocolonial domination and exploitation they have resisted for generations, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> the IWW has stood since its founding in 1905 for the proposition that:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.<br />
<br />
Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.&quot; and</blockquote>
<p><b>Whereas</b> since 2006 the tradition of the movement for the rights of migrant workers in the U.S. has been to mobilize themselves and their allies for mass actions on May 1 to disrupt the functioning of the economic system and political discourse of the 1%, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> every year May Day is celebrated globally as International Workers Day to commemorate the struggle of the international working class to emancipate itself through the class war over the centuries, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> May Day 1890 was proclaimed to be an international day of working class protest by the Second International against the repression of the 8 Hour Day movement in the U.S. where 8 mostly immigrant anarchist labor organizers were arrested, with 4 being hanged and one committing suicide the night before the hangings, after an unknown person threw a bomb at police who were repressing a protest against police brutality in Haymarket Square in Chicago, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> the Los Angeles branch of the IWW welcomes this opportunity to organize alongside OccupyLA and other participants in the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition to help the working class build the skills, the community, and the combativeness necessary to defend ourselves, our elders, and the generations to come from the global threats of austerity, exploitation, imperialism and ecocide.</p>
<p><b>Be it resolved that</b> the LA Branch of the IWW endorses the May 1, 2012 General Strike and commits to work as part of the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition by conducting trainings and participating in actions in the lead up to May 1.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 02/13/2012 - 12:25pm</p>
<p>Early in the morning on February 7, 2012, there was a fire in the apartments above the IWW General Headquarters in Chicago.<br />
<br />
<img align="right" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/chicagooff.preview.jpg" />The damage has left the building uninhabitable and we are unable to perform everyday operations. We believe damage to GHQ's files and equipment will turn out to be quite minimal, as we only suffered minor smoke and water damage.</p>
<p>We are already looking for a new location and hope to have GHQ up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will do our best to respond to the needs of the greater union, but our accessibility is limited and delays will be inevitable. We are asking that everyone remain patient while we assess damages and find a new home for GHQ.</p>
<p>Thanks and Solidarity,<br />
