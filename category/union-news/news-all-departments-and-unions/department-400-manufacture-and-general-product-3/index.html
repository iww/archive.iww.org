</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 08/10/2017 - 7:40pm</p>
<p><strong>By Marianne Garneau - <a href="http://blackrosefed.org/uaw-nissan-vote/" target="_blank">Black Rose Anarchist Federation</a>, August 7, 2017<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/nissan-workers.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="213" align="right" />There&rsquo;s been much attention over the reported <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/workers-mississippi-nissan-plant-casting-ballots-union-49027849" target="_blank">loss of a UAW union election</a> at a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi on Friday, August 4th. Many see the organizing effort as part of a larger question of whether the US labor movement can organize in the historically unorganized and union-hostile South. <a href="https://wobblycity.org/" target="_blank">New York City IWW</a> organizer Marianne Garneau writes this brief commentary offering her assessment. <br />
</em></p>
<p>The defeat of a UAW election bid at a Nissan plant in Mississippi got a tremendous amount of attention this week, particularly from the left. People seemed especially disheartened by the defeat, and almost at a loss for why things turned out so badly for the union. Sure enough, the internet produced all kinds of hot, world-historic takes explaining the outcome, a lot of them looking for some kind of exceptional circumstances here. Most zeroed in on the Southern context.</p>
<p>Granted, the union defeat was unfortunate. And it is possible it could have gone another way &ndash; we shouldn&rsquo;t think it was some inevitable outcome (there is way too much fatalism on the left these days). But the reasons why the UAW failed are perfectly legible, and none of them are novel. Everything about the loss &ndash; the union&rsquo;s strategy, the company&rsquo;s union-busting, the social and political context &ndash; was textbook.</p>
<h2>Why the UAW Vote at Nissan Failed</h2>
<p>1. The company union-busted like crazy. And yes, union-busting includes things like playing on racial divisions and threatening people&rsquo;s jobs (these are the sticks), and paying workers high salaries (the carrots). The bosses apparently built a tent outside the plant and met with every single worker on shift, including the ones who weren&rsquo;t even eligible to vote in the election. That&rsquo;s brilliant union-busting, but it&rsquo;s to be expected. That&rsquo;s why unions have a counterstrategy to that, called &ldquo;inoculation,&rdquo; where workers are prepared ahead of time for the boss&rsquo; rhetoric, and their sticks and carrots.</p>
<p>2. The union took a weak-ass, conservative, timid stance of mostly trying to keep the stuff the company was already giving workers and playing nice/reasonable with management. UAW has repeatedly said that it wants to work with companies to help their bottom line healthy, etc. That borrows directly from the boss&rsquo;s logic that they are gifting workers a job and a wage, as opposed to workers generating all the profits the owners get to pocket.</p>
<p>3. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) played its usual role of &ldquo;wot, us?&rdquo; It slowly churned through its processes of listening to complaints from either side. I don&rsquo;t even remember what the outcome was of its rulings (or if it ever got to them). But that&rsquo;s how little that matters to the actual, bloody fight &ldquo;on the shop floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. By the way, none of this has anything to do with &ldquo;the south.&rdquo; What is supposed to be unique here? The fact that other jobs in the area pay terribly? The fact that workers are divided along racial lines? The fact that union density is low? Those are exactly the same conditions that beleaguer workers, and organizing efforts, elsewhere.</p>
<p>5. And yeah, unfortunately, these workers, who presumably voted this way out of fear, and wanting to keep their jobs, will die on their knees as their wages get cut, their jobs get automated or outsourced, or they get replaced by lower-wage temps. You can&rsquo;t &ldquo;play nice&rdquo; or compromise your way to better wages or conditions. Playing nice with the boss means they retain the power to control your wages and your working conditions. The only alternative is to amass real power on the shop floor &ndash; real power to disrupt the flow of profits &ndash; and control how the boss treats you. You can&rsquo;t escape the forces of capitalism inside of one plant, but you can fight like hell over every single site where your labor is exploited for the boss&rsquo;s gain.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t avoid the class war; workers need to make it clear to the bosses that they can&rsquo;t either.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/28/2017 - 4:51pm</p>
<p><strong>By John O&rsquo;Reilly - <a href="https://tcorganizer.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/iww-members-stand-with-fired-ford-union-organizer-in-spain-solidarity-is-strength-en-ingles-y-espanol/" target="_blank"><em>The Organizer</em></a>, April 26, 2017 </strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/20170324_165859.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="180" alt="" />On Friday, March 24<sup>th</sup>, Twin Cities IWW members gathered outside the Roseville Ford dealership to stand in solidarity with a fired union organizer from our sister union in Spain. An organizer with the National Confederation of Labor (or CNT, for its name in Spanish) was fired in retaliation for organizing in Valencia, Spain. His court date for reinstatement was set for March 27<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>A dealership manager approached our members and told them they were annoyed that we were picketing their workplace. The manager insisted that the site was union friendly and then sent out the union representative from the service workers to talk with IWW picketers. IWW member BP reports that &ldquo;after some good conversation with the steward, he said he was on our side and took a large quantity of flyers &ndash; much to the dismay of the manager!&rdquo; Workers from the site soon gathered and mixed with IWW picketers, impressed by the dedication of our members to their coworker in Spain&rsquo;s cause.</p>
<p>Ford&rsquo;s restructuring plan, The Way Forward, lays out a strategy of closing down plants in the US and moving them overseas to countries where the wages are lower. That&rsquo;s why, as IWW member ED&nbsp;points out, &ldquo;the Twin Cities factory shut down, taking away 2000 well payed union jobs, while production is ramping up in Spain, where labor laws are changing to make firing workers easier.&rdquo; But the strategy only works as long as wages remain low in those countries. &ldquo;So, by busting unions in Spain, Ford can keep outsourcing jobs, which busts unions here in the US. An injury to one is very much an injury to all,&rdquo; ED&nbsp;adds.</p>
<p>The working class in the United States and globally is under attack by the international capitalists and their buddies in government. By moving labor and attacking workers organizations, the bosses try to keep us divided and fighting with each other, instead of working across national boundaries. Outsourcing only works if unions around the world are kept divided and weak. As ED&nbsp;points out: &ldquo;Global capitalism can only be answered with global labor solidarity!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/20/2011 - 3:51pm</p>
<p><a href="https://recompositionblog.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/holding-the-line-informal-pace-setting-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank"><strong>By Juan Conatz - originally posted at recompositionblog.wordpress.com</strong></a></p>
<p><img height="460" align="right" width="300" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/BreakdownPoster.jpg" alt="" />Often when talking to people about their frustrations at work and the prospects for organizing, a common response is one of negativity and desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could never get anything goin&rsquo; where I work!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Other people don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;It would be too hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These types of sentiments cut across industries and sectors. Even folks in officially unionized workplaces that have unaddressed grievances feel this way many times.</p>
<p>But while your preconceived ideas of what workplace organizing entails may clash with the obstacles you think of, other things going on in your workplace perfectly mesh with what we commonly call &lsquo;job actions&rsquo;. Slowdowns, work to rule and pace setting are all tactics that workers have used in response to management doing ans saying things we don&rsquo;t like. Most commonly, nowadays, it seems like our coworkers do these things as individuals, but when it expands beyond that&hellip;well, there&rsquo;s an opportunity to get somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>In early 2010, I was working at a warehouse as a forklift driver in Iowa City. Most of my day was spent on the shipping side of the building, pulling pallets off the production lines and staging them in a different area so they could eventually be loaded onto trucks. I also spent a fair amount of time loading these trucks, as well.</p>
<p>For the most part, the majority of my interaction with co-workers was limited to the other shipping forklift driver, the shipping manager and 2-3 temps who used a pallet jack to drop off pallets for me to stage.</p>
<p>The shipping manager, Phil, was basically a &lsquo;lead&rsquo;, with little power himself. Any power he had was mostly snitching power in that he directly answered to the Warehouse Supervisor. Phil was in his mid 40s and a casualty of the bad economy, being a recently laid of worker at a factoiry that made parts for General Motors.</p>

<br />
Workers staging a sit-in at the soon-to-close Vestas wind turbine plant on the Isle of Wight are being starved out by police.<br />
<br />
The police, many inside the factory and dressed in riot gear, have denied food to the workers who took over the factory offices last night, to protest about the closure of their factory. The police, operating with highly questionable legal authority, have surrounded the offices, preventing supporters from joining the sit-in, and preventing food from being brought to the protestors.<br />
<br />
Around 20 workers at the Vestas Plant in Newport, on the Isle of Wight, occupied the top floor of offices in their factory to protest against its closure which will result in over 500 job losses.<br />

Some
of our elected union officials have not proven their ability to
represent, let alone protect, union membersâ€”the people who pay their
dues and elected these officials.
</p>
<p>
We are losing pay, benefits, work rules and the contracts are eroding.
