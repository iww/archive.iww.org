Workers in struggle, Barcelona, Spain
</div>
<div>
Workers at the Frape Behr factory in Barcelona have occupied their factory
because of a company plan to fire 295 workers. The Behr company is in Stuttgart,
Germany, and it specializes in manufacturing of car air conditioning and engine
cooling systems. The need for solidarity by December 31 is urgent.
</div>
<br />
<div>
From CNT-AIT Barcelona we are supporting the workers of the Frape Behr
factory (sister company of the german Behr) in Barcelona. Behr has reported a
labour force adjustment plan (LFAP) to 50 workers and profit limits. For three
months the workers have rejected this offer.

What Power?&quot; of November 16th, 2007, in which the author attempts to portray the striking workers at Metro Lighting and their union as thugs attempting to &quot;take over Metro Lighting, or to drive them out of business trying.&quot; These accusations are too ridiculous to deserve a response, and they only serve to divert attention from the real issues at the store. Her editorial makes no attempt to deal seriously with the concerns of Metro Lighting's employees, so we would like to make these real issues known.</p> <p>Workers have the right, protected by law, to take concerted activity to improve their conditions at work and to bargain with their employer over these conditions. The workers at Metro Lighting were brave enough to assert this right, and have faced unwillingness to negotiate and illegal retaliation from the owners.
