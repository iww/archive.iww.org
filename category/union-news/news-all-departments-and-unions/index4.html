</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 11/30/2015 - 9:03pm</p>
<p><i><b>We prepared this short piece after several comrades were&nbsp;badjacketed&nbsp;in public and with pictures on social media at the 4th Precinct Shutdown.</b>&nbsp;We believe those individual cases have been dealt with, and don&rsquo;t wish to cause unnecessary division by complaining, or publicly calling any group or individual out. Instead,&nbsp;<b>this is intended to provoke reflection</b>, and conversation, amongst all of us, as to how to deal with the suspicions we may have of people we don&rsquo;t know in our growing movements, without creating the sorts of divisions among ourselves that does the work of the State and the police for them. We intend to act in solidarity with those who know how to act in solidarity.</i><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><i>We ask that all organizations and groups working for a better world in which we have killed White Supremacy, Capitalism, and all other forms of oppression, consider that (1) none of us represent the mandate of all the people, (2) that we may have instead genuine and important strategic and tactical differences between ourselves about the best ways to accomplish that world, (3) that&nbsp;<b>we will not win by pretending these differences do not exist, or dictating against difference, but instead by engaging on these differences in the most democratic and least hierarchical ways&nbsp;possible.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Therefore, we ask that groups and individuals read this document against the practice ofbadjacketing, discuss it, and consider publicly endorsing here that we will refrain from the practices of&nbsp;badjacketing.</b>&nbsp;This is not a call to be lax about security; indeed, many of us have been very involved in the provision of security at the Fourth Precinct. Instead, it is a call to be democratic and accountable about our security practices.&nbsp;<b>Please indicate your endorsement in the comments below.</b></i></p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-26 at 2.52.04 PM" src="https://twincitiesgdcdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-26-at-2-52-04-pm.jpeg?w=660" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party, and Anna Mae Aquash of AIM.</em></p>
<p>Every time people organize for liberation, autonomy, and a better world, the state and the bosses try to crush our movements. They don&rsquo;t particularly care how they do it, but they don&rsquo;t want to work hard. It&rsquo;s easier for them, if we do it for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can do this by misportraying us in the media, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sowing distrust and division within or between movements, and they do.</li>
<li>They can do this by harassing our people and preventing them from getting jobs, or demoralizing them with constant police contact, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sending infiltrators into our groups, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by encouraging fascist groups to attack us, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by directly and openly attacking us with police, and they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps the easiest and most effective thing they can do to neutralize and destroy our movements for liberation is to encourage us to act paranoid and to refuse each other&rsquo;s solidarity. One of the most effective techniques for this is called&nbsp;<b><span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;</b>(aka &lsquo;snitchjacketing,&rsquo; &lsquo;badjacketing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad-rapping&rsquo;), and it&rsquo;s when one of our own (or a paid infiltrator) accuses others without cause or evidence of being a infiltrator, threat, or security risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>BADJACKETING:&nbsp;</b>creating suspicion, by spreading rumors or unsubstantiated accusations, that people are undercovers, infiltrators, snitches, or cooperators. Sometimes this is done out of fear and paranoia. But normally, those who &lsquo;lay jackets&rsquo; on others want to consolidate their control over a movement and feel threatened in their authority. It&rsquo;s a favorite tactic of the State in destroying movements of liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tactics of the state and the police go together, and&nbsp;<span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;often leads to direct violence and the destruction of movements. If you&rsquo;re still reading, let&rsquo;s take a look at two well known regional cases: the State assassination of Illinois Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark Clark (1969), and the murder of American Indian Movement militant and Anna Mae Aquash (Mi&rsquo;kmaq) (1975).</p>

<a href="../../../content/can-%e2%80%9csolidarity-unionism%e2%80%9d-save-labor-movement/" rel="bookmark">Can “solidarity unionism” save the labor movement?</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 11/08/2015 - 2:56pm</p>
<p><strong>By Eric Dirnbach - <a href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/can-solidarity-unionism-save-labor-movement/" target="_blank">Waging Nonviolence</a>, November 4, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="510" align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/SolidarityUnionismCoverLrg.jpg" alt="" />The debate on how to revive the troubled U.S. labor movement has been around for decades. Labor activists generally believe that much greater rank-and-file democracy and workplace militancy is the key to labor renewal. However, an essential perspective that is usually missing from the conversation is well represented by Staughton Lynd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism: Rebuilding the Labor Movement from Below,&rdquo; which was first published in 1992 and has been recently reissued.</p>
<p>Lynd is a legendary progressive lawyer and activist from Youngstown, Ohio. He is the coauthor with his wife Alice Lynd of the classic &ldquo;Rank and File: Personal Histories by Working-Class Organizers,&rdquo; a collection of oral histories of militant union organizers, which informs much of the framework of &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism.&rdquo; At around 100 pages, the book reads more like a summary of his organizing philosophy, and many readers will come away wanting a more extensive discussion. It should be read along with several other recent books which make similar arguments: Stanley Aronowitz&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2015/02/review-can-labor-save-itself" target="_blank">The Death and Life of American Labor: Toward a New Workers&rsquo; Movement</a>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2014/10/review-alt-labor-or-not-it-will-take-rank-and-file-power-revive-us" target="_blank">New Forms of Worker Organization: The Syndicalist and Autonomist Restoration of Class-Struggle Unionism</a>,&rdquo; edited by Immanuel Ness, who also provided the introduction for &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynd argues for a rethinking of the assumptions of the labor movement and for a revived version of labor organizing that was more prominent in the pre-New Deal era that he calls &ldquo;solidarity unionism.&rdquo; What may surprise most labor-oriented readers is that central to this kind of unionism is the absence of a contract between the union and the employer.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the whole point of forming a union to get a written collective bargaining agreement? Lynd doesn&rsquo;t think so and he argues that workers fighting together with direct action on the job to make improvements in the workplace do not need a contract and may be hurt by having one. He is critical of the &ldquo;management rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;no-strike&rdquo; clauses that are standard in almost all union contracts. He believes they reduce the power of workers to influence major decisions in how the workplace is run and to solve their problems at work immediately as they arise. Contracts tend to remove agency from the workers and place it in the hands of union staff who typically bargain and process grievances while the members may be uninvolved and cynical. Lynd is also skeptical of a union&rsquo;s exclusive representation of all workers in the workplace and automatic dues check-off, preferring for workers to actively join the union and pay dues because they want to.</p>
<p>Lynd&rsquo;s view of the prevailing &ldquo;contract unionism&rdquo; differs from standard labor history, which considers the 1935 <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a>, or NLRA, labor reforms as a progressive advance for workers. In the mainstream view, workers organizing, with the support of President Roosevelt, finally won full government enforcement for the right to organize and bargain collectively. In exercising this right, unions typically hold workplace elections and then negotiate contracts with employers that set the conditions of employment and also guarantee labor peace (no strike/no lockout) for the term of the contract. This industrial relations framework led the way for millions of workers to organize and improve their wages and working conditions. This &ldquo;class compromise&rdquo; held for several decades until employers changed their mind and increased their opposition to unionization again.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/07/2015 - 1:55pm</p>
<p><strong>By Joe Allen - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/amazon-fedex-ups-post-office-teamsters/"><em>Jacobin</em></a>, November 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="244" height="320" align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/Fish.jpg" alt="" />It took the United Parcel Service one hundred and eight years to get to its current position in the world today, less than half that time for Walmart, DHL, and FedEx, and just over two decades for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/amazon-google-facebook-privacy-bezos/">Amazon</a>. The speed of transformation in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/logistics-industry-organizing-labor/">global logistics industry</a> is rapidly increasing, spurred on by Amazon&rsquo;s current building spree across North America and Europe.</p>
<p>For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-logistics-facilities-update-2015-10?utm_source=googleplaynewsstand&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">according to&nbsp;<em>Business Insider</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon has added 21 new logistics facilities globally over the last 12 months, up 14% from last year, bringing the total to 173 facilities worldwide. Of the 173 facilities, 104 are in the North America region, with the rest spread across Europe and Asia. The 173 logistics facilities include the large fulfillment-center warehouse; sortation centers, where packages get presorted for shipping; and Prime Now hub, a separate building to store one-hour delivery items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly big things are afoot. Amazon&rsquo;s recent job listing strongly suggests it is building a senior staff for a major logistics and transportation department that includes a&nbsp;&ldquo;Senior Program Manager &mdash; Last Mile Transportation SME,&rdquo; &ldquo;Driver Experience Manager,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Network Manager &mdash; Amazon Logistics Freight.&rdquo; A former Amazon engineer told&nbsp;<em>Business Insider</em>, &ldquo;If Amazon can stop paying FedEx and start controlling their own destiny in terms of the costs of fulfillment and shipping and transportation, it increases their profit margin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another sign of the rapidly transforming logistics industry is&nbsp;UPS&rsquo;s recent purchase of the Chicago-based Coyote Logistics for $1.8 billion. Coyote is a new model of freight forwarding; it has no vehicles or warehouses of its own, and instead provides logistics for 12,000 shippers with a network of 35,000 local, regional, and national carriers.</p>
<p>A decade earlier UPS made its largest acquisition up to that point when it bought Overnite Transportation, a huge non-union freight company. UPS&rsquo;s purchase of Overnite was a major move into the traditional freight business, and followed FedEx&rsquo;s acquisition&nbsp;of several regional freight companies and creation of FedEx Freight.</p>
<p>FedEx is also trying to keep up with the competitive pressures from Amazon and UPS. Earlier this year it acquired the Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express for $4.8 billion &mdash; giving it access to TNT&rsquo;s Europe-wide road network to compete with UPS and DHL &mdash; and FedEx Ground has announced plans to build large facilities in <a target="_blank" href="http://postandparcel.info/66543/news/fedex-aiming-to-build-new-distribution-hub-in-connecticut/" target="_blank">Middleton, CT</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flgov.com/2014/12/30/governor-scott-announces-fedex-ground-building-new-distribution-hub-in-ocala/" target="_blank">Ocala, FL</a>; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2015/03/17/fedex-to-start-50-million-hamburg-project.html" target="_blank">Hamburg, NY</a>.</p>
<p>DHL &mdash; formally DHL Express, a division of Deutsche Post &mdash; is also reinvesting substantially in its US operations, including a $108 million upgrade to its Cincinnati air hub that processes about 46 million international shipments each year. Though it is smaller than UPS&rsquo;s nearby Worldport or FedEx&rsquo;s Superhub, DHL&rsquo;s Cincinnati operations primarily focus on international shipments from Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If DHL is making investments in infrastructure expansion in Cincinnati, that means they&rsquo;re very confident that they&rsquo;re going to continue to grow their intercontinental network,&rdquo; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dhl-to-spend-108-million-to-expand-cincinnati-air-hub-1433101099" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;Brian Clancy, a managing director with Logistics Capital &amp; Strategy, a Virginia-based transportation consulting firm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DHL Global Forwarding signed an agreement with a Kazakhstan-based express company to speed the transit of rail-based freight across the Eurasian continent as an alternative to traditional sea and airfreight. In addition, it announced plans to establish its own parcel network in Austria by 2016 and to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dpdhl.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2015/dhl_invests_47_million_africa.html" target="_blank">invest</a> &euro;47 million in sub-Saharan Africa as part of an effort to derive&nbsp;30 percent of its revenue from&nbsp;emerging markets by 2020.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the scramble, the United States Postal Service (USPS), the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/usps-bronx-privatization-murals-new-deal-art/">venerable</a>, much-derided, and constitutionally mandated mail&nbsp;carrier, has emerged as a major player in the logistics industry.</p>
<p>This summer,&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-30/it-s-amazon-s-world-the-usps-just-delivers-in-it" target="_blank">called</a> the USPS &ldquo;an extension of Amazon&rdquo; and noted that &ldquo;Amazon receives a deep discount from the post office because the e-tailer does so much of its own processing &mdash; including providing computerized address lists to make it easier for carriers to tailor their delivery routes for faster drop-offs.&rdquo; A 2014 estimate by Bernstein Research, which tracks the shipping industry, put the USPS&rsquo;s shipments and deliveries at 40&nbsp;percent of Amazon&rsquo;s volume, or almost 150 million items (UPS accounted for&nbsp;20&ndash;25 percent and FedEx 15&ndash;20 percent).</p>
<p>While UPS, FedEx, DHL, and the USPS are fierce competitors, many people would be surprised by the cooperation between the logistics giants. Both FedEx and UPS have discounted residential package delivery services with the USPS called, respectively,&nbsp;SmartPost and SurePost. And the volume is enormous. Last year, the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-mail-does-the-trick-for-fedex-ups-1407182247" target="_blank">reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For FedEx alone, the post office delivers an average of 2.2 million packages a day, or about 30% of the express-mail company&rsquo;s total U.S. ground segment. UPS won&rsquo;t specify how many&nbsp;of its shipments go through the post office, but a regulatory filing indicates those types of lightweight shipments accounted for 40% &mdash; or about 37 million packages &mdash; of its total increase in ground shipments in 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both SmartPost and SurePost services are designed to deal with the unwanted costs of the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; &mdash; the industry term for the final step in the delivery process, handing over the package to the recipient. FedEx or UPS may have every address in the United States in their databases, but neither wants to go to every address every day, and they certainly don&rsquo;t want to make a second attempt if the recipient isn&rsquo;t home the first time around. The USPS, on the other hand, has to go to each&nbsp;address daily&nbsp;to delivery first-class mail.</p>
<p>Ultimately, UPS and FedEx want to snatch up&nbsp;the most profitable areas and dump the rest. For example, FedEx <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-23/fedex-to-fly-mail-for-postal-service-for-10-5-billion" target="_blank">beat out</a> UPS in 2013 for a seven-year, $10.5 billion contract with the USPS to fly its mail between US airports.</p>
<p>The rising volume of packages has transformed the USPS,&nbsp;necessitating&nbsp;major capital&nbsp;investment. In 2013, the post office spent $200 million to furnish its delivery vehicles with handheld scanners to provide real-time package tracking. And its plan to replace its fleet of 163,000 delivery trucks, which were not designed to hold packages, could cost as much as $4.5 billion.</p>
