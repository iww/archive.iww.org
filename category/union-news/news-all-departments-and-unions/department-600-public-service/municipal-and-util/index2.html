The
contract negotiations between the Bay Area IU 670 Recycling Workers
Union and the two Berkeley Recycling Companies has been a challenging
struggle, but workers have stepped up to fight for tremendous
improvements. The Bay Area IWW represents drivers at The Ecology
Center who do residential curbside pickup, and workers at The
Community Conversation Center yard who sort and process recycling
materials. Both workers have been waging shopfloor struggles to
resolve grievances and improve their working conditions. With both
contracts coming up for negotiations, workers stepped up the fight.
</p>
<p>
The
drivers met several times both at work and outside of work to draft
an ambitious list of roughly 15 demands including an across the board
wage hike, increase in pension payments by the company, and a change
to the current accident penalties. The existing agreement resulted
in termination of any driver who was involved in three accidents
incurring more than $1400 worth of damage. With the narrow winding
streets of Berkeley and the increasing costs of small accidents like
broken rear-view mirrors, we have seen several workers purposefully
dropping down to a loader after two incidents. This has resulted in
wage decreases of up to $10 per hour!

<p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../../graphics/IU670/EcologyCenter/iu670rally1.jpg" />Recyclers held a stop work rally to press contract demands on Thursday, November 8th, at recycling facilities in Berkeley.&nbsp; Thirty-five or so workers from two Berkeley recycling operations are in the midst of renegotiating contracts. At &ldquo;curbside&rdquo;, recycling trucks go out every week day morning to pick up residential recycling.&nbsp; Across the way at &ldquo;the Buyback,&rdquo; residential recycling from the trucks plus drop-off recycling is sorted by twenty workers.&nbsp; All workers are members of the IWW.&nbsp; Both union contracts expire on December 31st, 2007. &nbsp; During the rally workers from both shops stepped up and spoke about the need for unity, participation and solidarity in order to win their demands.&nbsp; Demands are not the same at both shops.&nbsp; However, workers at both shops are calling for a five dollar an hour wage increase across the board.&nbsp; This is a serious demand. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

Prior to the city's change, the recyclers worked seven routes daily, three of which were duo-routes (having two workers per truck) and the remainder were solo. <br /><br />Ecology Center management proposed adding an additional route, but making each of the eight routes solo routes.&nbsp; The Ecology Center recyclers have a route committee system, described in the union contract, though Management still has the official power to make the changes.&nbsp; While the union members on the route committee signed off on the changes, they were not aware of how the changes would affect the work once put into practice. &nbsp;<br /><br />After the first week of the change, it was clear that the eight solo-route plan was universally unpopular among the union workers.&nbsp; The union recyclers met on Saturday, September 8, 2007, along with organizers from the Bay Area IWW branch and some rank &amp; file workers from the city waste collection program.&nbsp; They agreed that they preferred to retain the duo routes. &nbsp;<br /><br />On Monday, the crew refused to operate their trucks until Management agreed to restore the three duo routes.&nbsp; After it was clear that no trucks would move until the union's demands were addressed, Daniel Maher, the operations manager, agreed to consider alternatives to the new, eight-solo route plan.&nbsp; The union crew demanded three duo routes and five solo routes.&nbsp; Maher rejected this plan and asked the crew to &quot;vote&quot; on an alternative. &nbsp;<br /><br />At first, Mr. Maher tried to single out shop steward, Mike Hudgins, and divide the crew, but this tactic didn't work.&nbsp; The crew was adamant about their demands and the strongest voices were those recyclers with the lowest seniority.<br /><br />One hour later, the union crew revealed that their &quot;vote&quot; was to stand firm by their demands.&nbsp; Mr. Maher, having encouraged the crew to vote on an alternative decided that democracy was only acceptable if the outcome was acceptable to his interests and asked the crew to &quot;vote&quot; again!&nbsp; So the union crew repeated the process.&nbsp; One hour later, the results were still the same!&nbsp; It was obvious that the union wouldn't budge!</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

The employers, Waste Management Co, imported scabs from other parts of the U.S. during the lockout and brought in their other allies, a mediator and Oakland mayor, Ron Dellums. The liberal community and the heads of the labor movement in this area have revered Dellums, a former congressman and mentor of another popular liberal Democrat, Barbara Lee. <br /><br /> When asked by the press if the lockout &ldquo;was a test of his leadership&rdquo; Dellums replied, &quot;I don't take it to have anything to do with me. It has to do with a company in a dispute with a labor union. It would be a gigantic mistake for me to personalize this. That's a journey I choose not to go on.&quot; (1) <br /><br /> With friends like these, it should come as no surprise that Waste Management got what they wanted.
