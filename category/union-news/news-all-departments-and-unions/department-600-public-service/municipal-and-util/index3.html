They had numerous grievances and decided union membership would be a way to bring their concerns to management.&nbsp; Eventually the workers voted unanimously for the IWW.</p> <p>During and after the union organizing campaign management took a very mean spirited approach to the union workers.&nbsp; Including harassment, intimidation, firing and forcing workers to quit.&nbsp; On top of the union busting strategy the company lost grant money to run an art outreach program to local schools.&nbsp; This development caused four workers to be laid off.&nbsp; Eventually, the union walked away from the bargaining table as nearly all the workers were laid off, fired or quit.&nbsp; Unfair Labor Practice charges were filed but had little effect.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
