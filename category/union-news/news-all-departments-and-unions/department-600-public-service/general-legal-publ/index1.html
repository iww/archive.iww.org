</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/01/2017 - 7:29pm</p>
<p><strong>By Cal - <a href="http://www.dciww.org/2017/07/26/dc-iww-supports-the-tpss-co-op-workers-union-for-15hour-and-a-union/" target="_blank"><em>DC IWW</em></a>, July 30, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/tpssphoto-624x832.jpg" width="320" height="427" align="right" alt="" />The DC General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) supports the TPSS Co-op workers in their struggle to unionize. Wages lag behind the rising cost of living in the DC metropolitan area. In Takoma Park, the average cost of living is much higher than in other parts of <a href="http://tpmobilization.org/the-fight-for-15" target="_blank">Maryland</a>, and even a starting salary of $11.50 is unacceptable. A starting wage of $15/hour&ndash;though not ideal&ndash;is a reasonable demand that allows workers the chance to afford rent, transportation, child care and sustenance in one of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the country.</p>
<p>We further support the rights of all workers to unionize, ensuring fair and equitable treatment during these trying times. Moreover, a union will foster a spirit of unity and cooperation among workers so TPSS Co-op can continue to be a place of respect, dignity, and community.</p>
<p>TPSS Co-op is a member-owned cooperative, and the IWW shares many of the the values and goals of the Co-op: a healthy planet, democratic/cooperative ownership, and community-sourced goods and resources. A fully democratically organized workplace is necessary to help strengthen the bonds between the co-op, its workers, its members, and the community at-large. &nbsp;The financial statements, publically available on the TPSS Co-op website, &nbsp;indicate good financial health through growth, profitability, and the ability to consistently meet its obligations. To remain successful, the co-op must also fulfill its obligations of utmost importance &ndash; paying a reasonable wage to its workers and providing improved working conditions.</p>
<p>We encourage the membership, the Board of Representatives, and the greater Takoma Park community to support the workers of the TPSS co-op in creating a truly democratic community.</p>
<p>We believe such a community is in the best interest of everyone and that a productive conversation, centering the workers&rsquo; needs, will build a stronger relationship&ndash;grounded in solidarity&ndash;between the TPSS workers and the Takoma Park Community.</p>
<p>We the membership of the DC General Membership Branch of the IWW hereby fully endorse the efforts of the TPSS Co-op workers&rsquo; union and pledge our support, solidarity and aid to our fellow workers.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/07/2015 - 1:48pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/victory-as-people-power-forces-liverpool-council-homeless-fines-u-turn/" target="_blank">Liverpool IWW</a>, November 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="213" align="right" src="https://liverpooliww.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/homelessness.jpg" alt="" />Liverpool Industrial Workers of the World unreservedly welcomes the sensational decision of Liverpool City Council to scrap their consultation on plans to fine the homeless a whole eight days ahead of its planned conclusion. We are delighted that homeless people now no longer face this added threat of being penalised for the social crime of homelessness.</p>
<p>Like Oxford, Hackney and Wycombe authority before them, Mayor Joe Anderson&rsquo;s council has floated the idea, hoping it will go through, only to be overwhelmed by the public backlash against it. In doing so, the council has shown the potential of mass working class action to make changes in the world. Anderson and Liverpool Labour have given way on this one issue, because it risked jeopardising the rest of their austerity agenda.</p>
<p>Only yesterday morning, Liverpool IWW started a Facebook event page proposing a demonstration against the homeless fines. Within hours, scores had pledged they would attend, hundreds of people had been invited, and many were leaving comments on the page. Some raised their own demands, such as Joe Anderson paying back the &pound;89,000 of public money he received from the council for legal advice on a private matter (he&rsquo;d been sacked by a school he did no work for).</p>
<p>The homeless fines threatened to be a &lsquo;straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back&rsquo;. When asked by the media for a reaction in response to Liverpool IWW&rsquo;s press release, the council retreated a step. The council&rsquo;s deployment of pro-cuts Councillor Rachael O&rsquo;Byrne to the Facebook event page confirms this.</p>
<p>Liverpool Labour&rsquo;s explanation for the whole affair beggars belief. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/news-and-comment/plans-to-fine-liverpool-beggars-1000-scrapped">Liverpool Confidential</a> , &ldquo;Anderson intervened to have the scheme scrapped after hearing about the proposals yesterday [Wednesday]&rdquo;. Councillor Steve Munby went on, &ldquo;The proposal was not a decision by the council cabinet, but was drawn up by officers following complaints from residents and the BID [Business Improvement District].&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are charitable to Anderson, it still looks devastatingly bad. He is the mayor of the city, he is paid a large salary, and he dines with the greedy business owners who were pushing this scheme on a very regular basis. If the official story is to be believed, he was somehow unaware of the council consultation nearly a month after it began on 9th October. He is therefore totally out of touch with the affairs of his own council, and totally incompetent.</p>
<p>The far more likely explanation, of course, is that Anderson, O&rsquo;Byrne, Munby and colleagues are simply lying through their teeth.</p>
<p>Liverpool IWW will continue to fight for the interests of all working class people in the local area, so we can guarantee that this is not the last that Mayor Anderson and all his bloodsoaked poverty pimps will hear of us.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 4:56pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/liverpool-iww-spread-message-that-claimant-advocacy-is-not-a-crime/" target="_blank">Liverpool IWW</a>, October 12, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="180" align="right" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/scousewobs.jpg" alt="" />This afternoon, members and supporters of Liverpool IWW held an information picket outside the town centre job centre, on Williamson Square. We are one of several IWW groups and other activist organisations holding demonstrations at job centres this week. Scottish Unemployed Workers Network called for solidarity with claimant advocate Tony Cox, who faces court in Forfar tomorrow on the ludicrous charges of threatening behaviour, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/901080539929227/" target="_blank">refusing to give his name and address and resisting arrest</a>. He was arrested at an Arbroath job centre last January, whilst representing a highly vulnerable unemployed woman.</p>
<p>Scottish Unemployed Workers Network assert that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that this case highlights the climate of fear that is evident within many job centres, but that it is not only benefit claimants that are treated with contempt. Welfare advisors are also being subjected to bullying and intimidation, as in the recent case of Mike Vallance at High Riggs Job Centre, when they attempt to represent, often highly vulnerable, benefit claimants. The SUWN will resist any and all attempts to curb the rights of welfare and citizen advocates to represent the unemployed, and we ask you to join us in our fight to ensure that ADVOCACY IS NOT A CRIME.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Liverpool today, we distributed info provided by<a href="http://www.edinburghagainstpoverty.org.uk/node/32" target="_blank"> Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty</a>, backing up with legal statements the fact that &lsquo;advocacy is not a crime&rsquo;. Claimants visiting the job centre took our advice enthusiastically, and were generally pleased that someone was taking a stand against the Department for Work and Pensions, and the bullying regime inside job centres. Our social networking presence also got a number of likes and follows during the picket.</p>
<p>In fact, the response was so positive that we will soon begin a regular series of job centre info distribution pickets, offering advice, encouragement and solidarity to claimants &ndash; who represent some of the most vulnerable elements of the working class.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 4:48pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2015/10/10/twin-cities-iww-wins-unpaid-wages-from-local-daycare/" target="_blank">Twin Cities IWW</a>, October 10, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="180" align="right" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/TwinCitiesDayCare1.jpg" alt="" />This summer, IWW member Anja was fired from her job at Crocus Hill Academy, a daycare. She was told that it was for talking to current and former coworkers about issues with their boss, Imran Khan. Two weeks later, Anja had yet to receive her final paycheck, her personal belongings, or a copy of her personnel file, which she had requested. Three union members from the Twin Cities IWW branch accompanied Anja to the daycare to deliver a demands letter. Mr. Khan reacted aggressively, shouting at and threatening the union delegation, accusing Anja of mistreating children, and calling St. Paul Police. He refused to accept the letter, and police asked IWW members to vacate the property.</p>
<p>The following day, a larger group of IWW members leafleted the daycare. As Mr. Khan yelled from the door, union members talked to parents about Anja&rsquo;s firing and other grievances. Upon Mr. Khan&rsquo;s continued refusal to receive the letter, branch members conducted a call-in and social media campaign against Crocus Hill Academy. Within a few days, Anja received a call from the school&rsquo;s new director, begging her to give him a copy of the demands which Mr. Khan refused to accept. She has since received her final paycheck and an additional check for $120 to compensate for her personal belongings and personnel file, both of which Mr. Khan &ldquo;misplaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manipulative, lying bosses like Mr. Khan are a danger to all working people, especially when they punish workers for protected activity like talking about work conditions and steal wages. But when we stand alone, or when we look to the government for help, we give up our power to fight. When we come together with other working people, we can get what we deserve. Direct action works and solidarity wins. Get in touch with the Twin Cities IWW if you have problems at work.</p>
