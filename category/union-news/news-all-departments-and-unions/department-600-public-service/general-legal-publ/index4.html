</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/21/2010 - 2:41am</p>
<p><i>Translated by a member of the British Isles IWW Regional Organizing Committee (BIROC)</i></p>
<p>Today the IWW distributed the following flyer (image not included) in front of the Frankfurter Stadtwerke [Municipal Services]:</p>
<p><b>Training outside working hours - "but can they do that?"
They keep getting more impertinent!</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/agitators/classic/union4allclassicsm.jpg" align="right" />Today, on Saturday, colleges at EUREST have to work, because by now so many people have been made redundant that trainings can no longer take place during regular working hours. The Compass Group has right during the crises made fat profits - on the backs of their workers. Reduced staff, reduced shifts and unpaid overtime, that's their trick.</p>
<p>So, it's not a surprise that trainings are now happening during the weekend. The location of the Stadtwerke is not the first one where this is practiced. But, no manager has put pressure on the workers quite so shamelessly. He doesn't care, that you have kids you need to care for. He doesn't even care if you're on holiday. You need to show up or proof that you already booked some trip. But time off is time off, and to force colleagues who have taken time off to go to work is, simply put, illegal.</p>
<p>A person like Tobias Engel does not seem to know, that the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany also apply to Eurest. Therefore, it's not surprising that the IWW Union learnt that he recently opened the locker of a worker. How long do you want to take such infringements?</p>
<p>If you don't resist, you'll soon need to show up every Saturday, for a training, or to clean. And the worst is, that it seems the shop steward agreed to this. Why do the NGG-shop stewards do whatever Eurest wants?</p>
<p>The problem, of course, are not just the cuddly unions and shop stewards, who don't represent the interest of the workers. As a union we can insist on the compliance with legal protections and rights of employees. But their implementation depends on whether the workers in the company resist the dismantling of workers' rights.</p>
<p>If you are ready, we'll support you in a big way!</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_676 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/german-language-roc/" rel="tag" title="GLAMROC">German Language ROC</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_422"><a href="../../../../campaigns/issue-oriented-campaigns/international-solidarity/" rel="tag" title="International Solidarity">International Solidarity</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_37 last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from General, Legal, Public Interest, and Financial Office Workers Industrial Union 650.

Fellow Workers,<br />
<br />
I am a Wobbly in IU 650 who was trying to organize my
workplace, here in San Diego.  I was working at a  group home for children with
Severe Emotional Disorders run by a nonprofit called New Alternatives
Incorporated. I started talking  to my coworkers on my shift about taking
collective action when I observed  it to be an  environment of intimidation and
favoritism.  <br />
<br />
A former Coworker told me it was standard procedure to
harass employees into quiting  at New Alternatives Inc. because they didn't want
to  pay unemployment.  I know when a friend of mine quit without a two week
notice the management called her up two weeks later yelling at her saying she
would not get a good reference from them.â€ <br />
<br />
I also heard coworkers
from another program stating when they wrote a letter about the problems with a
Shift Supervisor to the Program Manager, the Program Manager gave that letter to
the Shift Supervisor, who met with the signatories individually and scolded
them. This same shift supervisor once said that the employees of her shift
should not expect a break during their eight hour shift.  <br />
<br />
I had also 
talked to an employee who had worked a double shifts which amounted to
double-time hours, in California double time is anything in the excess of twelve
hours in a shift,  and distribute them throughout the week so he would not be
paid for double-time.  These are just some of the incidents as I had been the
target of harassment as well.  <br />
<br />
In response to several incidents I began
drafting petitions and distributing amongst my shift. The first petition letter,
which was sent to our  Program Manger and courtesy copied to the Executive
Director, dealt with a letter of expectation that we as shift singled us out.
Three of us signed this letter. The result of the meeting is we were able to
meet the Assistant Executive Director who heard our grievances but was sort of
standoffish about the whole incident.  The effect was we stood by our decision
not to sign and the whole incident dropped off the map.<br />

So I managed to get into this.<br />
<br />
Dressed in white with nice shoes, a
walmart unofficial souvenier T shirt and my IWW button Jennifer and I
approached the Convention center (Not the Pepsi center where the convention
is actually taking place.  Walked past a bunch of indiffent looking riot cops
and tried to go to the &quot;Union Event&quot;. I was told that I would have to get
someone from inside come out a get<br />
me, a not very likely
proposistion.<br />
<br />
So I went to the other side, smiled at the people holding
pictures of the mangled fetus and asked some people at a table about
attending the &quot;faith based event&quot;  I was asked for a ticket and said I had
none but really wanted to go, so they passed me through and told me to talk
to some people about late registration.<br />

<p>On the 21st August Chris Lockwood, union organiser and member of the Industrial Workers of the World was fired from his bar job at the Showroom Cinema in Sheffield (UK). This has been part of a long campaign by management of picking off and isolating workers who have voiced objections to recent changes that have worsened the conditions of all who work there. </p>
<p>The Showroom cinema is a registered charity and claims to be an "investor in people", yet has consistently attacked workers pay and conditions with the sole aim of greater profits. We believe that every worker (no matter what the industry) is entitled to respect and should be organised to defend themselves in the work place. Chris’ firing represents a direct and illegal attack against union organising.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_410 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/british-isles-regional-administration/" rel="tag" title="British Isles Regional Administration">British Isles Regional Administration</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_37 last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from General, Legal, Public Interest, and Financial Office Workers Industrial Union 650.

(Dave interviewed Ottawa anarchist Andrew Nellis for Linchpin. Andrew is an organizer with the Ottawa Panhandlers Union.)
</p>
<p>
<em>Q. What is the Ottawa Panhandlers Union and how was it started?</em><br />
<br />
A. The Ottawa Panhandlers Union is a shop of the Industrial Workers of
the World (IWW). It's a real union. What we do is run by the
panhandlers themselves. The IWW has one paid member for the entire
union. It's entirely member run. The idea is to empower people on the
street to fight for themselves.<br />
<br />
Ideally despite coming in as an outside organizer I'll be able to step
out of the picture once the organization is up and running and there's
a structure in place to ensure that the organization continues. I was
on the street myself. I'm not on the street now. So I do know something
about the milieu in which I'm working.<br />
