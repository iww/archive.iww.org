</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 04/15/2012 - 3:20pm</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" style="width: 270px; height: 200px;" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/foodservwork.jpg" />On behalf of Fellow Worker Moriah &quot;Mo&quot; Karn, the Richmond General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World and IU640 (Restaurant, Hotel, &amp; Building Service Workers Industrial Union) are initiating a campaign to demand that $183.18 in unpaid wages be paid in full to fellow worker Karn.</p>
<p>Fellow worker Karn worked as a bartender and waitstaff for 3rd St. Diner located at 218 E. Main St. in Richmond, Virginia. Karn has yet to receive any compensation for their labor after working a total of 86 hours at a wage of $2.13 an hour, between November 3rd and November 22nd, 2011.</p>
<p>Although in the state of Virginia, it is a violation of law to withhold a final paycheck from an employee after removal (see &sect;40.1-29 Va State Code), the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry was of little help. When fellow worker Karn filed a complaint with the Virginia Department of Labor, they were told that because there was no written proof of their hours worked, ie. a time sheet, schedule, etc., and because the employer failed to process their W2 form, there was nothing the Department of Labor could do for them.</p>
<p>In lieu of this news, on Friday April 6, 2012 a letter was issued to owner, Mr. William &quot;Billy&quot; Polyaris, requesting he do the right thing and pay fellow worker Karn in full by 4:00pm Friday April 12, 2012. Informing him that failure to do so would result in further action. We received no response.</p>
<p>Whereas the inability of the state to procure justice for workers who are victims of wage theft, and whereas Mr. Polyaris appears to have no remorse for the exploitation of his workers, we call upon supporters to participate in a phone blast, putting pressure on management and demanding retribution and accountability for Karn and her fellow workers.</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS- Six Jimmy John's workers fired nearly one year ago for blowing the whistle on company policies which force workers to make sandwiches while sick will get their day in court today. In November, the NLRB ruled that the March 2011 mass firing, as well as an anti-union Facebook group used by the employer, violated federal labor law. Organizers allege that the firing was a calculated attempt by franchise owners Mike and Rob Mulligan to decapitate the first unionization effort in the nation's fast food industry.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p><img align="right" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/anarchist.greenapron.jpg" alt="" />Union organizer with the IWW Starbucks Workers Union dispels the sentiment that 'being the better person' must entail living as a doormat.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of being told to be the bigger person. I get all the scrutiny. I should forgive the unforgivable. I should move on with my life, let it go, drop it, stop being confrontational, stop rocking the boat, stop holding grudges, and be the bigger person. When did &ldquo;being the bigger person&rdquo; mean just accepting being treated like shit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told not to create an &ldquo;us against them&rdquo; feeling between worker and employer. I did not create that. Employers created it and long before I was even born. It has always and will always be us, working ourselves to near death, against them, not lifting a finger to help but reaping all the spoils.</p>
<p>I fight this system of oppression because of all the love I have in me. It is because I&rsquo;m capable of great love that I am able to meet a coworker and know that I will fight for them regardless of who they are, the size of their families, where they are from, how they do their job, what languages they speak, and traditions they keep. Even if they can't fight for me, I will fight for them. It is because I think we&rsquo;re all truly worth something that I fight. Not everyone thinks like me. In fact, I think most people in American society are taught to never trust anyone. Everyone wants something from you, every boyfriend will cheat, every friend betray you, every parent leave you, every coworker steal credit for your work, every person asking directions will eventually ask for change, too. I don&rsquo;t see it that way. Every person that I meet I make a concerted effort to trust their words, listen to their stories, and give them the benefit of the doubt. Despite popular belief, I do this with bosses, too, to some extent. </p>

<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/LLSB.jpg" />I was raped by a boyfriend on August 18th, 2006. The very next day I held back tears while I lied to a stranger over the phone about why I was unavailable to go in that day for a second interview for a job that I desperately needed. When I hung up the phone I saw a new text message. It was from him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over. It will never be over between us&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day I went in for the second interview. It was inside of the Sears Tower Starbucks in Chicago. I took the train to the interview constantly looking around me and shaking. I needed work. I had just been fired from Target two weeks prior and had no prospects. I knew I would have to go through a metal detector in order to enter the building so despite every instinct in my body I did not bring a knife with me.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">&ldquo;What would you do if you caught a coworker stealing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>My mind is racing. I&rsquo;m thinking that I risked my safety by leaving my house for a stupid job that pays $7.75/hr. Aren&rsquo;t I worth more than that? Aren&rsquo;t we all worth so much more?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell management right away, of course. I&rsquo;ve never understood why someone would steal from work&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I tell them what they want me to.</p>
<p>I started working at Starbucks on August 22, 2006. That was a little over five years ago. Every year we have annual reviews where I generally get to argue with someone younger than me who makes significantly more than do about why my hard work, aching back, cracking hands, sore wrists, the bags under my eyes, the burns, the bruises on my arms, the cuts on my knees, the constant degrading treatment by the customers, the &ldquo;baby, honey, sugar, bitch&rdquo;, the &ldquo;hey, you, slut&hellip;I said NO whip cream!&rdquo;s, the staring, the following after work&hellip;I get to argue why all that means I&rsquo;m worth a 33cent raise rather than 22cents, Degrading for any worker. Degrading especially for a woman worker. Only for me, I get to do this every year just four days after the anniversary of when someone I was in love with raped me. My annual review is truly the only reason I&rsquo;m reminded of the anniversary of the assault.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/13/2011 - 2:56pm</p>
<p><strong><img height="223" align="right" width="300" alt="" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/foodservwork.jpg" />By David Feldmann</strong><br />
<br />
For several years, the IWW has had an active organizing drive in Jimmy John&rsquo;s sandwich shops, most notably in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn. (the Twin Cities). Earlier this year, six Jimmy John&rsquo;s workers were fired, ostensibly for violating the company&rsquo;s attendance policy regarding sick days. The workers were all IWW members who had been involved in attempts to publicize the food safety concerns of Jimmy John&rsquo;s sandwich makers in the Twin Cities. Naturally, the union members contend that they were targeted because of their involvement with the IWW and not because of their attempts to call in sick without finding someone to cover their shift (the contentious policy in question).<br />
<br />
On Nov. 4, Erik Forman, longtime IWW member and Jimmy John&rsquo;s worker, announced that &ldquo;the NLRB [National Labor Relation Board] is going to file a complaint against Jimmy John&rsquo;s on every single charge we filed against them.&rdquo; The Jimmy John&rsquo;s campaign went public in 2010 after a long period of clandestine organizing activity. In October of that year, the first fast food workers&rsquo; union in the United States lost a union election (85 in favor, 87 against) after franchise owner Mike Mulligan spent more than $84,000 on union busting, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. IWW members argued that Mulligan, who owns ten Jimmy John&rsquo;s stores in the Twin Cities, broke labor laws in trying to stifle the union&rsquo;s presence and influence. This position was reinforced by the NLRB, who threw out the election results in January 2011 after declaring Mulligan had, among other things, lied to employees about the union and unlawfully retaliated against IWW members. To date, the IWW hasn&rsquo;t called for another election, but has instead focused on exposing alleged health code violations at Jimmy John&rsquo;s locations and getting the fired workers reinstated at the fast food chain. After the results of the NLRB investigation were announced, the Jimmy John&rsquo;s union proclaimed that all &ldquo;six fired organizers will go back to work, with back pay, hopefully within the next few months.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
For a labor union that has historically eschewed legal recognition, the IWW has been surprisingly successful at convincing the NLRB that they are in the right, not just in regards to Jimmy John&rsquo;s but also in the more established campaign to organize baristas at Starbucks (the IWW has won even more legal victories in that struggle). Time will tell whether the IWW can withstand the onslaught of anti-union tactics employed by Mulligan and the rest of Jimmy John&rsquo;s management in the Twin Cities and continue to expand the union. Now that the NLRB decision has strengthened their resolve, this prospect seems very likely indeed.</p>
