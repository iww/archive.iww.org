</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 11/02/2005 - 5:32am</p>
<p><strong>By Friends of NEFAC, MONTREAL - <em>Industrial Worker</em>, October 2005</strong></p> <p><img border="0" align="right" src="../../../../../graphics/labor/globsolired.jpg" />The Confederation des Syndicats Nationaux has reached agreements at 18 Montreal hotels, and is now negotiating for similar agreements at other CSN-represented hotels across the province.</p> <p>The first weeks of July were a time of intense mobilisation for some 4,000 hotel workers in Montreal. Contracts ended June 30 and workers responded with a week of disruption that began with informational picket lines during extended lunch breaks and culminated July 8 with a 24-hour strike. &nbsp;Sheraton settled with the union an hour before its 400 workers joined the strike; the Hilton reached an identical agreement the next day, while the Omni responded by locking out its 200 workers for nine weeks.</p> <p>On July 12 a mass meeting set July 15 as the deadline to reach agreements with the remaining hotels. In the end, only the workers at the Plaza Metro Center had to go on strike to force an agreement matching the agreements with the Sheraton and Hilton. </p> <p>The agreement involves wage increases of 11 percent over three years and abolishes the &quot;wage ladder.&quot; After 30 days, everyone working the same job gets the same pay, promoting equality among workers. Instead, workers with more seniority will get more vacation time. Workers will now be entitled to 4 weeks' holiday after seven years on the job, and older workers can choose a three- or four-day work week. Health and pension benefits were also improved.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_36 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/03/2005 - 4:50pm</p>
<p><img border="0" align="right" src="../../../../../graphics/IU640/pizzacr1.jpg" />The former Pizza Time workers met with owner Heath Flores to discuss thereinstatement of four workers who lost their jobs in February. Floresbroke off negotiations on Tuesday by flatly refusing all six terms of thewritten proposal. We had hoped Flores would work with us to reach anagreement. We offered to draw up a new proposal with Flores' input, butthat idea was refused as well. Flores final offer was the same as hisfirstwe could turn in applications and may be hired and fired at will. We feel Flores is not taking the negotiations seriously and never intendedto consider our position.</p> <p>History of Negotiations with Heath Flores</p> <p>The former Pizza Time workers tried to arrange a meeting three timesbefore the store re-opened, but were met with closed minds on eachoccasion. On July 20th we returned to the corner of 4th and Jefferson tohold picket signs and share our story. At this point Flores agreed tomeet and discuss the terms for reinstatement in writing.At the first two negotiation meetings on July 29th and August 1st, we madeit clear that there was no animosity against Flores personally; what wewanted was resolution for the injustices served to us by former ownersShane Bloking and Richard Kelley. We asked Flores to recognize that theworkers unity and the communitys stand for justice ultimately droveShane Bloking out of the state, and gave Flores the opportunity to ownOlympia Pizza Time.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_246 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/olympia-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Olympia General Membership Branch.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 07/20/2005 - 2:44am</p>
<p><img border="0" align="right" src="../../../../../graphics/IU640/pizzacr1.jpg" />In February of 2005, all nine Pizza Time workers in Olympia WA and theirmanager Alex Wentz went on strike to take a stand against racism and tostand up for their rights as workers. Shane Bloking, a previous managerat Pizza Time, bought into the business and immediately fired twocompetent employees. Shane has a history of uttering racist comments andit came to no surprise when Abara, the stores only African-Americanemployee, was the first to be fired Shanes second day. Shane started toreplace the workers with his incompetent brother and his friends.</p> <p>Instead of watching our co-workers get fired for no good reasonone-by-one, we held a meeting at Alexs house that night. The remainingworkers didnt want to work at Pizza Time under these conditions. Wechose to take a stand on Feb 11th. We drafted a list of basic demandsthat night that had to be unconditionally met or we would stop making anddelivering pizza and go on strike. The demands were:</p> <ul><li>1)	Abara and John get their jobs back Jeff Bloking (the owner's brother)has to go.</li> <li>2)	No workers are fired without Just Cause and without warning</li> <li>3)	No more racial slurs</li> <li>4)	A friendly, clean and safe work environment</li> <li>5)	Standardized breaks</li> <li>6)	Respect our right to unionize</li></ul> <p>The next day all the workers rode down to the shop in the bright orangepizza van. We gave each other high fives the whole way down to the shop. Shane arrived at work over 7 hours late and found his entire staff waitingfor him, except for Jesus who was out on delivery. Once he walked throughthe door we confronted him with our list of demands.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_246 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/olympia-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Olympia General Membership Branch.
