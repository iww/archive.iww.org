<p>A non-traditional alliance of workers in Portland and Seattle organized a <b>Day of Solidarity with Hotel Frank Workers</b> last Friday, April 29. The Portland <b>Industrial Workers of the World</b> (IWW), the <b>Seattle Solidarity Network</b>, and Hotel Frank workers were all on the streets picketing <b>Provenance</b> hotels. Provenance is the hotel management company that threw the <b>UNITE HERE Local 2</b> contract at Hotel Frank in the trash almost a year ago.</p>
<p>In Portland, the <a href="http://www.portlandiww.org/" target="_blank">IWW</a> picketed <b>Hotel Lucia</b>. Provenance has its headquarters in Portland, as well as two upper-crust boutique hotels, Hotel Lucia and <b>Hotel deLuxe</b>. The IWW has a long history as a militant and radical labor union, often credited with popularizing the slogan and philosophy that <i>&ldquo;An Injury to One is An Injury to All.&rdquo; </i>That was certainly the spirit in evidence when they set up their picket line last Friday. You can see a short video of the action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBZCewlf2sQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In Seattle, the <a href="http://www.seattlesolidarity.net/" target="_blank">Seattle Solidarity Network</a> picketed <b>Hotel Max</b>, another high-end Provenance boutique hotel. SeaSol, founded in 2008, is a much younger organization than the IWW, but has already established a reputation for organizing successful campaigns for workers and tenants&rsquo; rights. They can mobilize an impressive number of people, and did just that on Friday.</p>
<p>And in San Francisco, Hotel Frank workers held our regular Friday afternoon picket. Hotel Frank workers declared a boycott of the hotel last September. Since then we have staged an escalating series of actions aimed at restoring our Union contract, including active picket lines and unannounced delegations to management.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/22/2011 - 2:03pm</p>
<p>Do you want someone with the flu or a cold to have to make your sandwich? Do you want to have to work when you're sick? Do you think workers should be able to afford to take a day off?</p>
<p>In cities across the US, restaurant workers aren't allowed to and often can't afford to take a day off when they are sick. But this barbaric practice might be about to change. In Minneapolis, MN, the IWW Jimmy John's Workers Union is waging a campaign for paid sick days... and winning. Until now, management at the Miklin Enterprises Jimmy John's disciplined and even fired workers who stayed home while sick without getting their shift covered. After months of pressure from union members, the franchise owners have begun to crack. The owners recently announced a new policy which allows workers to call in up to five times in a year without being fired. We still have a long way to go, but this concession shows that together, we can make our voices heard.</p>
<p>Help us take our message to Jimmy John's workers across the nation- together we can win paid sick days and the respect and dignity all workers deserve!</p>
<p>To participate, email the Union at <u>jimmyjohnsworkers [at] gmail.com</u>. We will give you instructions on how to set up an outreach event in your community.</p>
<p>Together, we will win!</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/22/2011 - 1:56pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/signing%20settlement.preview.jpg" align="right" /><b>By NYC Wobblies</b></p>
<p>Brooklyn, NY - After an aggressive nine month campaign consisting of both legal action and increasingly more militant direct action, the New York City branch of the Industrial Workers of the World was victorious in seeking justice for fellow worker Jeff Bauer, who was fired from the 7th Ave location of Ozzie’s Coffee & Tea on June 29, 2010.</p>
<p>Jeff Bauer worked at the independent Park Slope coffee shop, a neighborhood institution, for over a year and proved himself to be a hard worker with a strong work ethic. The quality of his labor was never questioned before his union affiliation with the IWW was leaked to management when Bauer helped organize a May Day benefit for the NYC branch of the IWW in 2010. In fact, Bauer was offered the Store Manager position, before it was given to Raphael Bernadine, but turned it down on principle as it went against his political beliefs as both an anarchist and a Wobbly. When management was made aware Bauer was organizing with the One Big Union their response was harsh and relentless. Bauer was subjected to mistreatment, harassment, and verbal abuse on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In June of 2010 Bauer suffered a severe cut in hours when he stood up for a coworker who was physically assaulted and threatened by Store Manager Raphael Bernadine’s boyfriend, an ex-cop, on the shop floor. In response to this retaliatory attack on Bauer’s right to defend his coworker from a violent confrontation, as well as his legally protected right to discuss workplace conditions, Bauer led a union delegation of six Wobblies and supporters into Ozzie’s Coffee & Tea. The purpose of this “March on the Boss” was to deliver a demand letter directly to Bernadine and officially notify him of Bauer’s affiliation with the IWW. Bauer’s list of demands included his hours be restored to 40, his only written warning be retracted and removed from his permanent record, an immediate cease to any and all harassment and/or retaliation based upon his union affiliation and for Ozzie’s to obey all federal labor laws, including those that relate to paid overtime.</p>
<p>When Ozzie’s co-owner Melissa Azulai found out about the demand letter, and the fraudulent and unnecessary 911 call, Jeff Bauer was immediately removed from the schedule and unlawfully terminated a week later. Azulai didn’t have the decency to fire Bauer to his face; instead she informed his then legal counsel, friend and comrade Daniel Gross, via a phone call. During this same phone conversation Azulai told FW Gross that “this will all blow over, it always does.” Gross informed Azulai that that’s not how the IWW operates, that when we start a campaign we stick with it until the bitter end. When Azulai refused to reinstate Bauer, Gross helped Bauer file Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). At the same time the NYC branch of the IWW launched an aggressive campaign of direct action that ranged from union-wide phone and email zaps to increasingly more spirited pickets and demonstrations in front of the store.</p>
<p>Six months later, on December 23, 2010, Region 29 of the NLRB found merit with Bauer’s claims and issued a complaint against Ozzie’s Coffee & Tea. A February 8, 2011 hearing date was set to take place in front of an administrative law judge. This was later postponed due to the beginning of heated settlement talks between Azulai’s lawyer, Eric M. Baum, Esq. from Simon, Eisenberg & Baum, and Bauer’s legal representation Benjamin N. Dictor and Quisquella Addison, legal interns from the Labor and Employment Law Clinic of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, under co-directors Dan Silverman & Michael Silverman.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://parkslope.patch.com/articles/former-ozzies-barista-settles-for-15500">By Kristin V Brown - <i>Park Slope Patch</i>, April 3, 2011</a> - Reposted in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">Fair Use Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Last month a former Ozzie's employee settled a suit alleging that the local shop discriminated against his union involvement.</p>
<p>A former Ozzie&rsquo;s barista settled for $15,500 last month after the National Labor Relations Board filed suit against the local java joint, claiming it discriminated against the barista for his union affiliations.</p>
<p>Jeff Baurer, 41, claimed that the coffee shop unfairly terminated him for his affiliation with Industrial Workers of the World (also known as the Wobblies), an international union that believes all workers should be united and the wage system must be abolished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can move on with my life knowing that at least one boss will think twice before interfering with a worker's right to organize for dignity and respect in the workplace,&rdquo; said Bauer.</p>
<p>Bauer claimed that before his termination last June from the Seventh Avenue and Lincoln Place shop, he was constantly praised by management as a model employee and even offered the manager position. Then his employers&rsquo; sentiments quickly changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ozzie's violated my legally protected right to join and/or form a union in the workplace,&rdquo; said Bauer, who worked at the spot for nearly a year. &ldquo;They harassed me, retaliated against me, reduced my hours, demoted me and terminated me for engaging in protected concerted activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former barista believes that someone leaked his affiliation to management when he was organizing a May Day benefit for the IWW.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 04/07/2011 - 3:13pm</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/3/31/starbucks-union-locke-students/">By Mercer R. Cook - <i>The Harvard Crimson</i>, March 31, 2011</a> - reprinted according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">Fair Use</a> guidelines.</p>
<p>Harvard students, union members, and Starbucks employees from around the country are planning to protest a lecture by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz at Harvard Business School on Friday.</p>
<p>Schultz will be speaking to several hundred Business School students on his experiences running a successful business while also be promoting his new book, &ldquo;Onward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Libert&eacute; Locke, an organizer of the event, said Starbucks employees are angered by what they deem to be hypocrisy in Schultz&rsquo;s book, in which he expresses his commitment to his &ldquo;partners&rdquo;&mdash;as the company calls its workers. Employees of the company, especially union members, feel that Starbucks is one of the least labor friendly companies in America, Locke said. Starbucks has been found guilty by the National Labor Relations Board of violating labor rights, including charges of union busting and wrongful termination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Howie [Schultz] to sit around and claim how much he loves us, it&rsquo;s just disgusting,&rdquo; said Locke, a Starbucks barista and Starbucks Workers Union organizer from New York. &ldquo;Starbucks is one of the biggest union busting corporations in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvard union representatives said they planned to support Starbucks workers in the protest.</p>
<p>Geoffrey &ldquo;Geoff&rdquo; Carens, an assistant librarian and member of the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers, emphasized what he called the &ldquo;phoniness&rdquo; of Schultz&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howard Schultz likes to present Starbucks as a socially responsible corporation,&rdquo; Carens said. &ldquo;In reality, conditions are really bad and getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
