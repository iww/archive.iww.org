</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 07/21/2011 - 1:31pm</p>
<p>The Guildhall, London according to its own website was designed to show the power of London's ruling elite. This tradition is continued today by annual speeches by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. The most recent event was a dinner in tribute to the new Ronald Regan statue attended by the Foreign Secretary, Condoleezza Rice and other dignitaries.<br />
<br />
Though regularly hosting wealthy patrons of this ancient and prestigious venue, the cleaning staff are failing to be paid for the actual hours they work. Whilst their hourly rate are far below the London Living Wage.<br />
<br />
In June of this year, 34 cleaners employed by Ocean Contract Cleaning London struck for 2 days because of many workers receiving underpaid wages over the last 3 months. On average 2 weeks of wages were missing. </p>
<p>The company promised to pay the overdue wages by the 20th of June and so the dispute was suspended.<br />
<br />
However when the cleaners received their last pay packets, the company failed to keep their promises which resulted in the cleaners calling a new strike day for 15th July with a picket outside London Guildhall 5:30am to 10:00am.<br />
<br />
The workers raised a collective grievance to review the salaries for the past 6 months but Ocean Contract Cleaning London are have ignored this and refuse to participate in any collective bargaining process.<br />
<br />
The cleaners of Guildhall are on poverty pay rates of &pound;5.95 per hour, whilst working in one of the most expensive cities in Europe and receiving no sick pay or pension. According to the London Living Wage Unit this is officially poverty pay and the London Living Wage has been set at &pound;8.30.<br />
<br />
There will be banners and support by fellow trade unionists including Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 07/21/2011 - 1:22pm</p>
<p>Early&nbsp; morning contract cleaners hired by the City of London at Guildhall have staged a two day strike in protest at unpaid wages. The 34 cleaners only get the minimum wage, but even then cleaning contractor Ocean has underpaid many of them continuously over the last 3 months, despite asking them to work extra hours.<br />
<br />
Their&nbsp; patience ran out on Tuesday 14 and Wednesday 15 June, when those still unpaid refused to lift a finger until the company gave them assurances&nbsp; they would be paid. Their other workmates agreed to stay put with them&nbsp; in the reception area in solidarity for the duration of their two hour&nbsp; shift. The situation is now on a knife edge, with&nbsp; the company issuing some &quot;amended&quot; payslips, and promising that the rest&nbsp; of the shortfall will be made good this week and in next month?s pay&nbsp; packet.<br />
<br />
The&nbsp; workers, who hail from many different countries, are meanwhile presenting a collective grievance and have vowed to protest if the company fails to come up with the goods. They belong to the IWW's 640 (Cleaners and Allied Trades) branch. The last visible protest movements by City cleaners were at UBS's Liverpool Street offices in 2010 and the Willis Building in 2009.<br />

<p><strong>By Julie Jargon - <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, July 6, 2011</strong></p>
<p>In what would be Starbucks Corp.'s first strike at a company-owned store, baristas at the chain's outlets in Chile plan to walk out Thursday because, they say, their wages are so low that they can't afford to buy lunch.</p>
<p>Unionized employees at 30 of Starbucks's 31 Chilean stores plan to walk out for as many as several days, said Andr?s Giordano, president of the union, Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile.</p>
<p>Mr. Giordano, a 24-year-old shift supervisor in Santiago, said the starting hourly wage for Chilean Starbucks workers is the equivalent of $2.50, and it hasn't changed in eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;Lunch in Chile costs $5 to $6,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Chilean workers have been pressing for a lunch stipend since they organized two years ago. Starbucks managers in Chile get a monthly &quot;lunch bonus&quot; of $50, while other employees are offered two free coffees a day. &quot;I would prefer to eat a sandwich,&quot; Mr. Giordano said.</p>
<p>The skirmish underscores one of the challenges U.S.-based companies like Starbucks face as they expand their global footprint. Multinational companies seeking to enter new markets often have to deal with local labor groups and government requirements to honor collective bargaining.</p>
<p>As a condition of merging with African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently agreed to honor union-bargaining agreements for three years.</p>
<p>Starbucks has had to comply with government-mandated participation in collective-bargaining agreements in Brazil and Argentina. The company has also clashed with workers who tried unsuccessfully to organize in Europe and New Zealand, and it has battled with unionized workers in North America, where 300 employees are members of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.</p>

<p>Fellow Worker Mathew Bair was fired July 8 from a JJ in Grand Rapids for alleged costumer complaints, when the facts are that Bair never was told of any complaints and always received praise and good tips from costumers.
