<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 05/15/2018 - 7:50pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-wins-second-victory/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, May 14, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/BVWU2018S_0.jpg" width="320" height="186" align="right" alt="" />The following statement was released yesterday from the Burgerville Workers Union, after another store successfully won union recognition. The BVWU is the first officially recognized fast food union in the United States and is a part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</span></em></p>
<p>Today Burgerville workers once again voted overwhelmingly in favor of the BVWU, this time at the Gladstone location. This is the second NLRB election the BVWU has won in a month. The first, at 92nd and Powell, made us the only fast food union in the country, and this one demonstrates the momentum the BVWU has going into contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Gladstone workers in particular deserve extra celebration for their win today. Despite the friendly attitude Burgervi<span class="text_exposed_show">lle has taken in the press about being willing to work with the union, Gladstone workers didn&rsquo;t see anything close to friendliness on the shop floor. During the election, despite all their words of openness and cooperation, Burgerville was up to its old tricks: retaliation, intimidation, even straight up lying. Gladstone workers faced down all of that and STILL won a major victory for the union. Standing up to your boss like that takes bravery and every one of them deserves applause.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>The win at 92nd wasn&rsquo;t the end of the fight, and neither is this win at Gladstone. The fight won&rsquo;t be over until Burgerville stops paying us poverty wages, stops threatening undocumented immigrants through their use of e-verify, and stops treating us like we&rsquo;re disposable. We demand respect, and we won&rsquo;t stop until we get it. Gladstone is an important step in that journey.</p>
<p>Remember too that the boycott is on until the company signs a fair contract. They&rsquo;re not off the hook yet.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 04/30/2018 - 1:45pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-becomes-first-formally-recognized-fast-food-union-in-us/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, April 24, 2018</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/Burgerville.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="220" align="right" />Burgerville Workers Union has won a union election in one location, meaning that the company will be forced to negotiate a contract with the workers. Other stores are expected to soon come on board. BVWU, a part of the IWW, also becomes the first fast food chain in the US to be unionized. </em></span></p>
<p>We won the election. We did it. We made history.</p>
<p>Today workers at 92nd and Powell overwhelmingly voted yes, making the Burgerville Workers Union the only formally recognized fast food union in the country. For a long time people have dismissed fast food as unorganizable, saying that turnover is too high, or the workers are too spread out. Today Burgerville workers proved them wrong.</p>
<p>The fight isn&rsquo;t over, of course. We still need to bargain a fair contract with Burgerville, an<span class="text_exposed_show">d until then the boycott still stands. And we need to remember what got us to this point: workers taking action for themselves, standing up against poverty wages and horrible conditions. We got here because of the strike, union benefits, pickets, and marches on the boss. We got here through direct action, and that won&rsquo;t change now that we&rsquo;ve won an election. If anything it&rsquo;s even more important.</span></p>
<p>In this moment of victory we want to celebrate, yes, but we also want to turn our attention to the 4.5 million other fast food workers in the United States. We want to speak to everyone else who works for poverty wages, who are constantly disrespected on the job, who are told they aren&rsquo;t educated enough, aren&rsquo;t experienced enough, aren&rsquo;t good enough for a decent life. To all of those workers, to everyone like us who works rough jobs for terrible pay, we say this:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to that bullshit. Burgerville workers didn&rsquo;t, and look at us now.</p>
<p>Because our win today isn&rsquo;t just about Burgerville. It&rsquo;s about history. It&rsquo;s about a movement of workers who know that a better world is possible, and that together they can make that world real.</p>
<p>Today we became the only recognized fast food union in the country. But we won&rsquo;t be the only one for long.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 02/21/2018 - 9:08pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/portland-burgerville-singles-one-worker-retaliation-following-strike/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, February 16, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/5-13-1068x648.jpg" width="320" height="194" align="right" alt="" />The following report from the Burgerville Workers Union states that management has come down against one pro-union worker of color since the end of the historic three day strike. To learn more about the strike, </em><a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/audio-report-burgerville-workers-union-finish-three-day-strike/" target="_blank"><em>check out our audio report podcast here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Burgerville chose to celebrate Valentine&rsquo;s Day yesterday by retaliating against a union leader. Michelle, a worker at the Convention Center Burgerville who participated in our historic three day long strike, was just suspended by management for allegedly taking a chicken patty without permission.</p>
<p>Though retaliation against union members under trumped up &ldquo;theft&rdquo; accusations is a pattern at Burgerville, Michelle&rsquo;s suspension demonstrates a particularly disturbing unders<span class="text_exposed_show">ide to that pattern. Along with Arsenio and Canaan, Michelle is the third pro-union worker of color to be fired by Convention Center management in as many weeks, a management which remains entirely white despite the diversity of the crew. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">In the targeting of union members of color at the Convention Center, to put it bluntly, we see not only union busting but outright racism. These attacks on our jobs and our families by Burgerville corporate are not just against Burgerville workers, but rather against the rights and power of the Portland community as a whole.</span></p>
<p>The BVWU does not take this lightly. In addition to Arsenio, Canaan, and Michelle, two other pro-union workers at stores that went on strike have been fired or suspended for similar charges within the last few months. Though Burgerville claims to be an ethical, locally minded fast food company, their wages keep workers in poverty, and when those workers try to better their lives, they are threatened with firing.</p>
<p>In Michelle&rsquo;s suspension, we see Burgerville perpetuating an atmosphere of fear and racism in order to fight the union, and we are currently in talks with our allies around Portland as well as our legal counsel as to how to best proceed. Please stay tuned &ndash; moments like these, when people&rsquo;s jobs are on the line, are when we need our supporters the most.</p>

<p>In this audio report, we talked to someone with the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BVWkrUnion">Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU)</a>, which is a part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a revolutionary anti-capitalist union founded in 1905. The Burgerville campaign went public in 2016, and in the past several years, has launched a series of strikes, job actions, pickets, and various campaigns in the face of an ongoing anti-union crackdown.</p>
<p>In response to this repression, members of BVWU have built relationships with various local groups and unions, who have in turn brought people to walk pickets lines and often serve free hamburgers outside of Burgerville stores during various job actions. To learn more about this back story, check out our previous podcast interviews with <a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-take-job-organize/">BVWU members here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-service-workers-revolt/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this interview, we specifically talk about the recent three day strike launched by BVWU, which grew to include four stores in total who were involved in the strike. Over the course of three days, IWW members picketed stores, encouraged customers not to pay patronage to the business across the city, held rallies which were joined in solidarity with other unions, and also announced the &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.boycottburgerville.com/">Boycott Burgerville</a>&rdquo; campaign.</p>
<p>While certainly not the first or only large scale fast-food worker strike, the Burgerville campaign is historic, and represents the growing capacity of rank-n-file workers to self-organize and take action where they are to fight back against their bosses and conditions in a rapidly gentrifying city.</p>
