<p><strong><a target="_self" href="http://nefac.net/node/1934">By Jeff Shantz, Punching Out Collective (NEFAC-Toronto)</a></strong></p> <p> Recently much interest and discussion has been generated by the emergence of union flying squads in Ontario. Flying squads -- rapid response networks of workers that can be mobilized for strike support, demonstrations, direct action and working class defense of immigrants, poor people, and unemployed workers -- present a potentially significant development in revitalizing organized labor activism and rank-and-file militancy. </p> <p>Here are organizations with rank-and-file participation working to build solidarity across unions and locals and alongside community groups, engaging in direct action while striving to democratize their own unions. No wonder then that the re-appearance of flying squads in Ontario, in a context of halting resistance to a vicious neoliberal attack, notably among some sectors of the labor movement, has been cause for much excitement. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_7 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for Department 600 - Public Service.
