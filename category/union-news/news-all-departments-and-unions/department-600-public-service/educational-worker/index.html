</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:03pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://portlandiww.org/2017/08/official-endorsement-voz-workers-rights-education-project-pdx-iww/" target="_blank">Portland IWW</a> - August 15, 2017 </strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/cropped-header1.png" align="right" alt="" />The Portland IWW is proud to endorse Voz: Workers&rsquo; Rights Education Project. Founded in 2000, Voz has been connecting day laborers to work, supporting worker-led organizing, and offering trainings.</p>
<p>Voz is a worker-led organization that gives power to immigrant workers that may not otherwise have the means to organize and bargain for humane working conditions and fair wages. Having the ability to organize and fight for these universal goals gives immigrants the ability to work, to better empower and enrich their communities and lives. </p>
<p>The Voz: Workers Rights Education Project is currently campaigning for their Building The Dream campaign, petitioning the city of Portland for the rights to purchase the property at 240 NE Martin Luther King JR Blvd., to provide immigrant workers and day laborers with a place to meet potential employers, discuss the conditions of their labor, while having the choice to sell their labor to whomever they believe will give them the respect that they deserve.</p>
<p>As such, Voz requires support from community organizations to help them fight for these rights, and to show the city of Portland that the community stands with them and will help defend the exploited and under-privileged workers that move our city and society forward. The Portland Industrial Workers of the World has long worked alongside the VOZ: Workers Rights Education Project and firmly believes that day laborers &ndash; like all workers &ndash; should have secure sites from which to organize and direct their own labor.</p>

<p><b>By 6eoff - <a target="_blank" href="http://iwwboston.org/2016/01/25/wobs-instrumental-in-getting-workers-job-back/">Boston IWW</a>, January 25, 2016</b></p>
<p><img width="320" height="214" align="right" alt="" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/img_6910.jpg" />Pictured are MISU&rsquo;s John P (recently reinstated), Evan and John M, as well as Genevieve, Geoff, Max and Jon from the Boston IWW.</p>
<p>IWW members returned to aid our friends and fellow workers in the Museum Independent Security Union on 1/23/16. Despite freezing temperatures, our hearts were warmed by a message from John M of MISU, who conveyed his belief that IWW support was &ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; in getting unfairly-fired MISU member John P re-hired with no discipline and with back pay. John P was fired by Boston&rsquo;s Museum of Fine Arts merely for fulfilling his responsibilities as a parent. The outcry that followed (which Boston wobs are proud have helped with) compelled the museum to take John back. The MFA has been forcing working parents out of their jobs and taking a hard line in contract negotiations with MISU, and the battle is not over yet. Please join the Boston IWW and MISU for pickets at the Museum of Fine Arts, Saturdays from 12-2 pm.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/27/2016 - 12:03am</p>
<p><b>By the <a target="_blank" href="http://lifelongwobbly.com/2016/01/18/workers-power-against-police-brutality-and-racist-terror-2/">Life Long Wobbly</a> - January 18, 2016</b></p>
<h2>The Chicago Teachers Step Up &ndash; What does it mean?</h2>
<p><img width="320" height="178" align="right" alt="" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/tciww-african-peoples-caucus.png" />The decision of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) to participate in the Black Friday <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20151126/streeterville/teachers-union-join-black-friday-mag-mile-laquan-mcdonald-protest">protests against police brutality</a> is an important step forward, advancing both the struggle against the Chicago police department, and allowing the CTU to flex its muscles before the end of its contract. Chicago Teachers voted overwhelmingly to support a strike in their recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/chicago-teachers-union-strike-rahm-emanuel-laquan-mcdonald/">strike authorization vote</a>, and if they can win another strike as they did in 2012, it would be an incredibly important victory for the working class around the country. It would show that education workers can fight and win, especially if they have united with the broader working class around issues such as institutional racism.</p>
<p>The simmering rage against Chicago&rsquo;s blatantly racist, terrorist, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/chicago-cops-detained-7-000-secret-interrogation-center-article-1.2404256">secret prison-operating</a> police department provides an important backdrop. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.revivingthestrike.org/">US anti-labor law illegitimately limits what workers can strike over</a>; if the teachers go on strike, and demand the removal of police from school campuses, or defunding of the police force, that would make their strike &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; in the eyes of the state. Chicago teachers have an important choice. Even if the teachers go on strike and don&rsquo;t say a word about the police, the CPD is intimately tied to Rahm Emanuel&rsquo;s austerity regime, and a teachers&rsquo; strike could strengthen and build on the movement against police brutality and terror. However, if the teachers do explicitly include anti-police demands in their strike, and stick by them even when threatened with injunction, they could really inspire the rest of the working class in Chicago to mobilize and support them. A victory in that case would also show that workers can successfully take on the system of anti-labor laws in this country, particularly those which declare certain kinds of strikes &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Could teachers and other education workers strike to remove police from schools? Nothing could stop them from putting this into their demands. If a teachers union prioritized &ldquo;cops off campus&rdquo;, and waged a strike on the level of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/teachers-strike-chicago-explained">Chicago in 2012</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/heres-why-seattle-teacheres-are-strike">Seattle earlier this year</a>, this would be a massive step forward. This would be particularly powerful to the degree that it spread beyond the teachers to include other education workers. Of course, any industrial action for &ldquo;cops off campus&rdquo; would meet bitter resistance from the city administration, at the same time that the national media, the Democratic Party, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; the national unions would stop at nothing to sabotage this action, and force or cajole the workers into moderating their demands.</p>
<p>This is why militant education workers would have to prepare for this struggle, beginning by consciously identifying with the victims of police brutality, against the police rather than with them. An initiative to strike for &ldquo;cops off campus&rdquo; might need years before education workers actually have the strength and organization to pull it off &ndash; but the situation in the US over the last several years has also been very fluid, and things could develop much quicker than we might expect.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/30/2015 - 9:11pm</p>
<p><b>By Angry Language</b><b> - <a target="_blank" href="https://libcom.org/blog/language-workers-got-tallents-27092015">LibCom.Org</a>, September 27, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/180x187xEWIU620.jpg.pagespeed.ic.fpDvhmbgjh/" />Ultimately, we were forced to go down the legal route. That means that IWW members at LSSE only got the legal minimum, despite our belief that the callous mistreatment we suffered while at the school entitled us to further compensation. In any case, we got more than Craig had ever planned to give us.</p>
<p>We're proud to say that in our effort to make Craig pay up, the workers ran militant and well-organised campaign. We occupied the school. We forced Craig <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/struggle-leicester-square-school-english-story-so-far-15012015" target="_blank">to resign as a governor of the Bancroft School</a> and to <a href="http://asparagusconsulting.com/" target="_blank">shut down the website of another one of his business interests, Asparagus Consulting</a>. We <a href="../../../../../content/callout-24-hour-email-campaign-target-wage-stealing-boss/" target="_blank">hassled him at his residents' association</a>. We held numerous <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/picket-leicester-square-school-english-21012015" target="_blank">pickets and protests</a> in Leicester Square and at the <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/lsse-struggle-next-stop-drapers-09022015" target="_blank">Drapers' Guild</a>, where Craig is a member of some note &ndash; actions which did not go unnoticed by senior officers of the organisation.</p>
<p>To any other workers who may ever have the misfortune to work for Craig, we have a message for you: if he mistreats you in any way, you've got the support of the Angry Language Brigade and the IWW. It doesn't matter if you're a language school worker or not; if Craig's your boss, we got your back.</p>
<p>And let this be a message to any future would-be business partners: Craig Tallents is a toxic asset. Besides his consistently underhanded business practices, he's got two organisations who are ready and willing to picket and protest anywhere he sets up shop.</p>
<p>Jon Bigger, the IWW caseworker who helped the workers, said &ldquo;this case was a good example of a boss trying to hide when the going got tough. Future workers and business partners of Craig Tallents will no doubt take note of his actions. Bosses should take note of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those who've followed the dispute, one of the key issues was that Craig had illegally and intentionally misclassified a number of teachers as self-employed. This meant that when Craig shut down the school, he thought he could do so without paying those teachers thousands of pounds in holiday and notice pay.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you've been misclassified &ndash; <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/tackling-uks-“freelance”-tefl-scandal-18112014" target="_blank">a major problem in language schools</a> &ndash; you have recourse. Raise it collectively with your workmates or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/status-customer-service-team" target="_blank">contact HMRC</a> who can contact your employer to make them sort out their records and pay you any back pay to which you may be entitled. HMRC can be contacted anonymously, but it's probably best if you have someone like a union rep call on your behalf.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 09/20/2015 - 3:18pm</p>
<p><b><strong>By Andrew Stewart</strong></b><b> - <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/18/friedrichs-v-cta-the-supreme-court-case-that-could-destroy-labor-unions-as-we-know-them/" target="_blank"><em>CounterPunch</em></a>, September 18, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/180x187xEWIU620.jpg.pagespeed.ic.fpDvhmbgjh/" alt="" />This Presidential campaign has become even more of a media spectacle than the last two were, which in and of itself proves our electoral system is broken because the voters treat governance like professional wrestling. The Republican field is so close to a Vince McMahon Slam-O-Rama match that we do not even need to come up with silly stage names for these doofuses.</p>
<p>But what stuns me most about the Democratic field is that, even in the midst of our kinda-sorta dialogue about democratic socialism brought about by the Sanders dog-and-pony show, not a single candidate has yet to talk about the cornerstone of a socialist society, our barely-breathing labor unions. We have heard news stories about everyone&rsquo;s favorite walrus, AFL-CIO President <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/afl-cio-endorsement-2016-democratic-primary-119701" target="_blank">Richard Trumka</a>, coming down from on high and reminding the masses that he, not they, get to choose whether the unions endorse Sanders or Clinton. But the elephant in the room which no one is talking about is the <em><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/friedrichs-v-california-teachers-association/" target="_blank">Friedrichs v. CTA</a>&nbsp;</em>Supreme Court case, which has seen the Petitioner Brief filed on September 4, 2015, followed by nineteen amicus curiae briefs on September 10 and. For those just tuning in, this is the case that will destroy labor unions as we know them in our country. This omission from our national dialogue is analogous to the three months before 9-11 when everyone was telling President Bush that something was going to happen but he was too busy farting around on his ranch to care.</p>
