</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 10/28/2005 - 3:44pm</p>
<p>From&nbsp; <a target="_self" href="https://plawiuk.blogspot.com/">http://plawiuk.blogspot.com/ </a>- Eugene Plawiuk, October 23, 2005.<br /></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051022.wteachers1022/BNStory/National/">Teachers' union backs mediator's report</a><br />A few hours later, B.C. Supreme Court Justice Brenda Brown levied a $500,000 fine on the teachers' union for waging an illegal strike. Earlier, Ms. Justice Brown had frozen the union's assets making it impossible for striking teachers to receive their $50-a-day strike pay. It's the largest fine in Canadian history for civil contempt.<br /></strong><br /><img border="0" align="right" src="../../../../../graphics/agitators/modern/others/strike_chalkboard.jpg" /> While the success of mass pickets by the BC FEd of Labour and CUPE led to the government buckling under and calling for a mediator...the final acceptance of the mediators report was made by the union...mass picketing worked...but as I predicted there would be no General Strike. Rather the labour movement, which does not consider itself a militant workers movement, but rather an intergral part of the capitalist system, accepts contracts as sacred. It accepts the give and take of labour relations as all there is, There is No Alternative (TINA).<br /><br />And so the BC Teachers Federation accepted the mediators report which did justify the unions concern that class sizes were too big. But it said nothing about their other demands, whether about working conditions, wages or even an amnesty.<br /><br />That being said the state of course has not assured the workers that they will accept the mediators report, and they allowed the courts to fine the union hours after the union capitualted.<strong><br /><br /></strong><em>&quot;While the government accepted Mr. Ready's report, the teachers' union wanted a commitment from the province on a cap on class sizes.But B.C. Labour Minister Mike de Jong has refused to make any such guarantee.&quot;</em><br /><br />Vengenace is in the mind of the Campbell government after being embarassed by the teachers walkout, the mass pickets and the overwhelming support of the people of B.C. for the teachers. This fight is not over, as the courts and Campbell government will use the Teachers as their whipping boy for daring to challenge them...the writing is on the wall. The teachers were fined hours after accepting the mediators report.<br /><br />The teachers had no choice but to compromise, given the weight of the State and its Courts against them...this is a lesson for the whole labour movement, that workers rights are not given by contracts or the State, they are taken when we walk out and take the streets or when we seize our work places and put them under direct worker and community control. Such situations not only challenge the government but the very nature of capitalism.<br /><br />Unfortunately the short sightedness of the labour movements vision has left the teachers in B.C. facing fines, and further charges, which of course they will bemoan but do little to affect. The Teachers should not go back to work until they are assured of a general amnesty. The public pickets and mass demonstration should continue until the Teachers are assured of this.<br /><br />Unfortunately the labour movement has no intentions of doing anything of the sort. Not being a revolutionary workers movement, let alone a socialist one, they cannot concieve of doing anything other than going back to work.<br /><br />Should they ever envision a workers movement to overthrow capitalism, they will of course shake their heads in disbelief as if arising from a bad dream. Not possible they will say. Foolish workers who believe in socialism, they will say. Like the foolishness of believing in the General Strike.<br /><br />It is only a minority in the workers movement, they will say, the vast majority of our members don't want socialism or to create a classless society, they want to merely survive within capitalism.<br /><br />The best we can expect from the labour movement is capitulation to contract law and the injunction that we should vote NDP to ameliorate the worst excesses of capitalism.<br /><br /><strong>ONCE AGAIN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT IN CANADA HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS THE HAND MAIDEN OF CAPITALISM AND NOT A WORKERS MOVEMENT.</strong><br /><br />But that should come as no surprize to anyone, well except the small sects on the Left who insist that unions can be radicalized. Not likely, as they are part and parcel of the capitalist game of labour relations, they lack vision beyond the mundane bread and butter issues of the daily grind under capitalism.<br /><br />That they mobilized mass picketing is the least they could do, given the fact that the workers in B.C. have faced over four years of neo-liberal attacks by the Campbel neo-liberal Government. But they failed again, as they did with the nurses strike last summer, to go all the way to a General Strike. At the eleventh hour they once again capitualted to the State.<br /><br />This should not surprise anyone since the workers movement exists beyond the reach of the unions, who speak for no one but their well heeled carrerists in the bueracracy.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_34 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="All workers in educational institutions." class="active">Educational Workers Industrial Union 620</a></li></ul> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../../../../../node/1538/" title="Read the rest of  B.C.

</h2>

His books are taught worldwide and the London School of Economics recently asked him to give its annual Malinowski lecture, an offer reserved for the world's most promising young anthropologists. <br /><br />And he's about to be unemployed. <br /><br />Graeber is an anarchist whose counterculture writings are nearly as popular as his academic work. He carries an Industrial Workers of the World union card and has been arrested during anti-globalization protests. <br /><br />So when Yale recently told Graeber not to return next year, it touched off a letter-writing campaign from professors worldwide, some of whom suggested that the Ivy League university is letting politics influence its hiring. <br /><br />&quot;It's extremely odd that one of the most brilliant anthropologists is being excluded from the department at Yale in such an extraordinary fashion,&quot; said Maurice Bloch, a London School of Economics anthropologist and one of many professors to write letters to Yale. <br /><br />Graeber, who has taught at Yale since 1998, has appealed the decision. University spokesman Tom Conroy said the university is negotiating an informal settlement but would not discuss the reasons behind the contract decision. <br /><br />Dozens of the 250 non-tenured professors at Yale come up for contract renewal each year, Conroy said, and it's not unusual for them to leave. He said some leave for personal reasons or take tenure-track jobs at other universities. Others, like Graeber, are not renewed. <br /><br />Graeber, 44, is the son of a seamstress and a print plate stripper and still lives in the same New York City co-op where he grew up. &quot;Socialist housing,&quot; he calls it. He wears cargo pants to class and is not shy about his disdain for the tenured Yale faculty who showed him the door. <br /><br />&quot;I'm both more productive intellectually than they are and I'm having more fun. It must drive them crazy,&quot; he said in an interview. <br /><br />Later, he added: &quot;I'm publishing like crazy. I'm all over the place. I try hard not to rub it in.&quot; <br /><br />Graeber said he got along with his colleagues at first and passed a three-year review before leaving for sabbatical in 2001. While away from New Haven, Graeber joined groups such as the Direct Action Network and Ya Basta and began appearing at anti-war and anti-globalization protests and in newspaper articles. <br /><br />When he returned to Yale, he said things changed. <br /><br />&quot;All of a sudden, people weren't speaking to me,&quot; he said. <br /><br />At his six-year review, he said he was given only a short-term renewal because some colleagues expressed concerns. <br /><br />&quot;It was incredibly petty,&quot; Graeber said. &quot;It was stuff like, 'He turns in grades late, comes in late to class.' Really stupid little things.&quot; <br /><br />He said he made more enemies by objecting when some colleagues tried to kick out a graduate student. The student, Christina Moon, was an organizer trying to unionize graduate students and prepare a strike. <br /><br />This spring, when his contract was up for review again, the department voted not to extend it. Like all employment decisions, it was made behind closed doors. Even Graeber doesn't get to know why. <br /><br />Andrew Hill, chairman of anthropology at Yale, did not return a call for comment. He told the student-run Yale Daily News that professors should not assume they will be rehired. <br /><br />Enrique Mayer, a Yale anthropology professor who was in the department's meeting, said he doesn't believe Graeber was fired simply for being an anarchist. <br /><br />&quot;I have my own opinions, but I'm gagged,&quot; Mayer said. &quot;There are people who don't like his politics and people who don't like internal graduate student issues. That's true.&quot; <br /><br />Despite being eccentric _ an adjective echoed by several anthropologists and students _ Graeber's classes are among the most popular in the department, Mayer said. <br /><br />&quot;If Yale can't cope with eccentric possibilities, that's rather odd,&quot; Bloch said. &quot;It's had many in the past. He doesn't run around naked in the middle of lectures. He doesn't do anything as radical as that.&quot; <br /><br />Moon, a doctoral candidate, is one of dozens of anthropology students who signed a student petition supporting Graeber. She said he is the department's most popular professor but is not liked by the senior faculty. <br /><br />&quot;He was really challenging the attitudes, the politics and the conservative views of the department,&quot; Moon said. <br /><br />Since Graeber's firing, he has become a cause celebre for student union activists. It's bittersweet, he said, because he disagrees with the union's centralized organization and tried hard not to get political on campus. <br /><br />&quot;I figured, I'll be an anarchist in New York and a scholar in New Haven,&quot; he said. <br /><br />Peter McLaren, a UCLA professor and outspoken Marxist who is among more than 4,000 names on a general online petition supporting Graeber, said that can be difficult. He said he was similarly fired early in his career. <br /><br />&quot;It's the professors that get active locally and in their communities, where newspapers stories come out about them. They're the professors very often that are in trouble,&quot; he said. &quot;If you keep your ideas to your politics and your books, you're OK.&quot; <br /><br />As negotiations continue between Graeber and Yale, letters keep arriving on campus. A student-run Web site supporting Graeber has collected nine letters signed by several dozen professors. <br /><br />&quot;It has also led to widespread speculation on the motives that lie behind it,&quot; University of Chicago faculty members wrote. &quot;None of this can do anything but a disservice to anthropology at Yale and to the discipline at large.&quot; <br /><br />With his job prospects for next year uncertain, Graeber didn't renew a lease on his apartment. He splits his time between his New York co-op and apartments in New Haven where friends let him sleep. <br /><br />Though he said he'd like to stay at Yale, he's touching up his resume just in case. But he worries whether his reputation is tainted. <br /><br />&quot;Anybody looking at this is going to think one of two things: Either Yale is very, very bad or I did something very, very bad and they're not saying what it is. You're going to cut it either way depending on how you feel about anarchists and how you feel about Yale.&quot; <br /><br />___ <br /><br />On the Net: <br /><br />David Graeber's official Web site: <a href="https://www.iww.org:2096/horde/services/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yale.edu%2Fanthropology%2Fpeople%2Fdgraeber.html" target="_blank">http://www.yale.edu/anthropology/people/dgraeber.html</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />Student-run protest site: <a href="https://www.iww.org:2096/horde/services/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.com%2Fgraebersolidarity%2F" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/graebersolidarity/</a>&nbsp;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_34 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="All workers in educational institutions." class="active">Educational Workers Industrial Union 620</a></li></ul> </div>
