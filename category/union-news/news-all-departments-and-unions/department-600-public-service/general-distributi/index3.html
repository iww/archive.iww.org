Starbucks shut down the store’s drive-thru this morning and delivered a
list of demands including affordable health care options and sick days
for those displaying H1N1 or other cold and flu symptoms. Starbucks
doubled the cost of the company health insurance plan in September,
leaving many workers unable to afford treatment because of sky-high
deductibles and premiums.<br />

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/26/2009 - 2:56am</p>
<div><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/starbuckslogo2.jpg" align="right" />
Hello Fellow Workers, Customers and Friends of Aizze!
</div>
<br />
<div>
Thank you so much for your support for Azmera.  By signing the petition, calling-in to Starbucks management, and coming out for a hugely successful picket of the Snelling &amp; Selby store last Saturday, we have sent a strong message to Starbucks that Aizze is not alone and that we will not stand for discrimination. The picket was covered by several media outlets, including the Star Tribune &lt;<a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/53307332.html">http://www.startribune.com/local/53307332.html</a>&gt; and
Pioneer Press &lt;<a href="http://www.twincities.com/life/ci_13132224">http://www.twincities.com/life/ci_13132224</a>&gt;. According
to workers at Snelling &amp; Selby, sales dropped by over 50% during the hour and a half that we picketed the store.
</div>
<br />
<div>
After the picket, Aizze had a brief phone conversation with Becky Critch, Starbucks Human Resources Manager. We had hoped that Starbucks would present an offer, but instead, Critch attempted to dominate the conversation, asking probing questions about Aizze's work history.
</div>
<div>
Critch refused to allow Aizze to answer questions in writing.  After the traumatic experience of her interrogation in the back room of the store, it is highly insulting for management to expect Aizze to submit to further oral questioning.
</div>
<br />
<div>
With no offer from Starbucks on the table, it's time to increase the pressure.
</div>
<br />
<div>
What's Next?
</div>
<br />
<div>
1.  Please continue to call Starbucks Area Director DIMITRI HATZIGEORGIOU at 312-731-8909 to tell him you support Aizze's
demands.
</div>
<br />
<div>
2.  We have invited fellow workers, customers and community members to come and meet Aizze on SUNDAY, AUGUST 30 at 1PM at Coffee con Amore, 917 Grand Avenue, Saint Paul.  This will be an opportunity to hear from Aizze, discuss the next steps in the campaign, and learn more about the Starbucks Workers Union. Join us!
</div>
<br />
<div>
3. During this tough time for Aizze and her family, you may consider making a donation to help Aizze while she is unemployed.  A customer of Aizze's established a fund through PayPal for supporters to make donation directly to Aizze. You can donate at <a href="http://tcsbuxunion.com/">http://tcsbuxunion.com</a>
</div>
<br />
<div>
Again, thank you all so much for your support and solidarity with us in this struggle.

<img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/starbucksNYT1.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Saying it spends nearly as much on health insurance for its workers as it does on coffee, Starbucks recently announced that it would increase the amount that eligible employees need to contribute to keep their health care coverage.<br />
<br />
On Monday evening, newly unionized Starbucks baristas gathered at the company’s regional headquarters in Manhattan to protest the move, which they said would effectively double the cost of their health insurance.<br />
<br />
The change would increase the cost of the most basic plan to $20 from $12.50 each paycheck and the annual sign-up cost to $200 from $100, according to Liberte Locke, a barista who has been active in unionization efforts with the Industrial Workers of the World.<br />
<br />
“If they’re going to charge us this amount, our pay needs to increase,” she said. She added that a growing number of employees were ineligible for the health insurance because they worked fewer than 20 hours a week.<br />

<p>

Ask anyone and they’ll tell you that Aizze was the best barista at the
Snelling &amp; Selby Starbucks in St. Paul, MN. She knew every
regular's drink and could make a latte in 28 seconds. She has 20 MUG
awards for her job performance, and was never written up in her two
years of service, nor was her till ever ‘over’ or ‘short.’ Her
coworkers and customers loved her; they called her 'Aizze' (pronounced
'Ozzie'), short for Azmera. This description is in the past tense
because Starbucks wrongfully fired Aizze on July 8, 2009. Starbucks
management accused her of theft, although they themselves ADMIT that
they have no video or other evidence to support their accusation.<br />
<br />
Adding
insult to injury, Saint Paul District Manager Claire Gallagher took
advantage of Aizze’s limited English abilities and bullied and
manipulated her into signing a promissory note saying she would pay
Starbucks the arbitrarily- determined amount of $1200. Acting through
the notoriously anti-worker law firm Olonoff, Asen &amp; Serebro,. LLP,
Starbucks has since sent Aizze a letter threatening to send their
baseless claim to a collections agency.<br />
<br />
Azmera is not a
thief. An immigrant from Ethiopia, Azmera has been a citizen of the
U.S. for the past ten years. She has worked at Starbucks for the past
two years. Together with her husband, a Taxi driver, Azmera is the
proud mother of three young children. Aizze is an honest, deeply
religious woman who loves her job and works hard to care for her family.<br />
<br />
<strong>How did this happen?</strong>
</p>
<p>
On
July 8, 2009, Aizze was told to sit in the back room at the end of her
shift, alone with St. Paul District Manager Claire Gallagher. For
almost two hours, she was not allowed to leave, and no other workers
were allowed to enter. The DM made a conference call with “Partner
&amp; Asset Protection” Manager Chris Vanderhoof and together they
began to interrogate Aizze. When Aizze informed her interrogators that
she did not understand what they were saying, they just repeated the
same words over and over. Aizze was not offered an interpreter. She was
told that if she didn't sign the promissory note, they would call the
police and have her arrested. Thinking of her children, she signed the
paper. Her interrogators told her flatly that they had no proof or
video of her stealing money, yet they accused her of theft. Aizze never
stole. If there was change someone didn’t want from a transaction,
Aizze put it in the tip jar, but she never, ever stole.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why Aizze?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We
can only speculate on why Aizze was targeted, but one thing is clear:
Starbucks thinks they can get away with victimizing her because she is
an immigrant and a non-native English speaker.<br />
<br />
<strong>What You Can Do To Help</strong>
</p>
<p>
We
all have a responsibility to stand up for the most vulnerable amongst
us. We will not sit idly by while Starbucks management victimizes one
who has come to this country seeking a better life. We demand immediate
reinstatement, the immediate nullification of the promissory note, and
an apology to Aizze. Justice must be done for Aizze and all workers.<br />

<strong>IWW Starbucks Union Condemns Starbucks Doubling Health Insurance Costs Health Coverage Cuts Come Amidst Soaring Profits</strong><br />
<br />
Starbucks, amid massive profits, announced on Monday that it will slash
at employee health care benefits. The company announced that premiums
for its most economical employee health care package will nearly
double, along with across the board increases in out-of-pocket
expenses. This slap in the face to workers comes just one week after
the announcement of $256 million in profits for the quarter, far
exceeding internal and Wall Street expectations.<br />
<br />
These cuts are an insult to Starbucks workers, and the thousands of
workers who have been laid off in the last year. The increased costs of
health benefits will be a barrier to many workers thinking of
enrolling, forcing them to make the hard decision between health care
coverage and feeding their families.<br />
<br />
We expect more from Starbucks as a leading Fortune 500 company that
builds its brand image on its treatment of its &quot;partners&quot;, what it
calls employees. Starbucks has a responsibility to provide affordable,
quality healthcare to its workers, who are responsible for its enormous
profits. Instead, Starbucks continues to use health care benefits as a
marketing tool, while actually covering a lower percentage of its
workforce than the notoriously unethical Wal-Mart.<br />
<br />
Starbucks has repeatedly shown that it cannot be trusted to compensate
us fairly. We believe as workers we must organize together to hold
Starbucks accountable, and give us the respect and dignity we deserve.<br />
<br />
<strong>About the IWW Starbucks Workers Union:</strong><br />
