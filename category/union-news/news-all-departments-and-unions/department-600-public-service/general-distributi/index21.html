</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 08/20/2007 - 3:28am</p>
<p><img width="261" height="196" border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU660/sbux/89781/" />By Diane Krauthamer</p><p>Despite Starbucks&rsquo; international union-busting attempts, workers and their supporters are telling the company that they are not backing down. Increased organizing and support is growing like wildfire throughout Europe and the U.S., and this past weekend proved once again that the struggle is far from over. <br /><br />On August 18, 2007, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and No Sweat held a successful National Day of Action against Starbucks, with demonstrations in ten cities across the UK, including Glasgow, Leeds, Edinburgh, Leicester and London. <br /><br />Although the company has more than 500 stores with over 5,000 workers and continues to expand in the UK, management is growing nervous as negative publicity surrounding their unfair labor practices increases regionally. <br /><br />In London, small groups spent the morning distributing informational leaflets to baristas at both Starbucks and Caff&eacute; Nero, another major UK coffee chain with working conditions that parallel those of Starbucks. Starbucks baristas are paid just above the minimum wage and are subject to excessive working hours and unpaid overtime. Additionally, baristas must work at a relentless pace, resulting in repetitive strain injuries. <br /><br />By 2 PM, the groups convened in front of the New Oxford Street Starbucks, a busy shopping district in the central city. More than 30 people spent the windy Saturday afternoon protesting and distributing information to customers, workers and onlookers. In addition to the dozens of protesters, undercover police officers and regional management also made a presence at the event. Two police officers were spotted across the street from the demo, illegally taking photos of individuals from the IWW and No Sweat. <br /><br />One of the managers, wearing a beige sweater as a feeble attempt to conceal his company t-shirt, sat inside the store &ldquo;reading a newspaper&rdquo; while keeping the protest under surveillance. When I asked him if he was there to protest, he said he just wanted to make sure that nothing would &ldquo;get out of hand.&rdquo; He admitted that the company had already known about the protest beforehand, despite the fact that the protest location was only communicated over email, and not made public. <br /><br />The manager asked if we were planning any other demonstrations, and when everyone packed up to go home, he followed the group down the street. <br /><br />As Starbucks' headquarters in Seattle is advising regional management in the UK to embark on campaigns of surveillance and intimidation&mdash;as they have done in the U.S., France and Germany&mdash;workers are not backing down. Many baristas showed interest in joining the union, and many potential customers turned away from the store when they received information about the company&rsquo;s practices. Continued harassment is evidence that the company who sets the world's coffee industry standard feels threatened by the power of radical unionizing and solidarity that continues to expand across international borders <br /> </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_410 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/british-isles-regional-administration/" rel="tag" title="British Isles Regional Administration">British Isles Regional Administration</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_272"><a href="../../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/starbucks/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Starbucks campaign.

Worldwide it has over 12,000 stores and employs over 100,000 people. In Britain , it has over 500 stores employing 5,000 workers.<br /> <br /> Starbucks baristas in the UK are barely paid above the minimum wage and are subject to excessive working hours, unpaid overtime; work at a relentless pace, resulting in repetitive strain injuries for many workers. In the US , Starbucks has waged an illegal union-busting campaign resulting in firing of six baristas in New York City .<br /> <br /> Coffee growers receive little more than 0.50p for a pound of coffee, which is then sold for &pound;80.<br /> <br /> Oxfam launched a campaign against Starbucks in October 2006 after it effectively blocked Ethiopia 's attempts to trademark its coffee beans in the United States .<br /> <br /> The tide is turning against Starbucks. In the UK the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is organising the Baristas United Union in several organising campaigns at Starbucks; in the US the IWW-Starbucks Workers Union is expanding across the country; in NZ hundreds of casual fast food workers, including Starbucks baristas organised into the UNITE union; workers are getting organised in France and Germany too.<br /> <br /> 18 August is a national day of action against Starbucks. The IWW, No Sweat and many organisations and supporters are holding protests in cities right around the UK .

Eight outspoken union employees fired on pretexts ranging from the absurd to the offensive. Human and video surveillance tracking the every move of union members or those suspected of union sympathies. Non-stop anti-union propaganda. Threats, bribes, interrogations, and discriminatory disciplinary actions.<br /><br />Workers complaining about a wage leaving them in poverty and fluctuating work schedules interfering with family obligations. Employees relying on Medicaid for health care or just doing without insurance. Workers afflicted by repetitive stress injuries driven by understaffing and ergonomic neglect.<br /><br />In some ways, you wish the multinational corporation described was Wal-Mart. At least with Wal-Mart, you know what you&rsquo;re dealing with. A cold heartless corporation running roughshod over the workers it employs and the communities in which it operates. Wal-Mart succeeded in squeezing more profits out of its employees and suppliers than anyone else but it failed in creating a socially responsible brand.<br /><br />Those who believed corporate social responsibility (CSR) represented an important and positive change within capitalism will be disappointed that the corporation described is Starbucks. Because Starbucks, unlike Wal-Mart, has succeeded in the social responsibility game. In fact, no corporation plays the game better than Starbucks.<br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
