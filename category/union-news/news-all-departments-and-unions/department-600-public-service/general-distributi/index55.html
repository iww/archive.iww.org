The multi-count complaint, detailing unlawful activity at three Starbucks stores, comes after an independent investigation of the world's largest coffee chain triggered by charges from the IWW Starbucks Workers Union. </p> <p>The NLRB complaint alleges that Starbucks fired union member Sarah Bender to discourage employees from engaging in protected union activity. The complaint further alleges that the company surveilled, interrogated, and discriminated against union member Charles &quot;Anthony&quot; Polanco. Then Starbucks, contrary to past practice and policy, refused to allow Mr. Polanco to revoke his stress-induced resignation before it became effective.</p> <p>&quot;Yes, the 'happiest company on Earth' dismisses people for exercising their right to form a union,&quot; remarked Sarah Bender. &quot;I'm now just looking forward to getting my job back to continue the organizing drive.&quot; </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

The workers, joined by union baristas from two other New York Starbucks stores, demanded a guaranteed minimum of 30 hours of work per week and an end to Starbucks' unlawful anti-union campaign. The Union will assail Starbucks with a wide array of actions until the demands are met.</p> <p>One of the workers, 23 year-old Tomer Malchi, served the store manager with a document detailing the demands and several other workers directed comments at the boss to be relayed to more senior management. Suley Ayala, a mother of four who has worked at Starbucks for three years, was one of the workers who spoke. She explained after the event: &quot;it should go without saying that we can't live on ten, eleven, or twelve hours of work some weeks. The 30 hour guarantee is absolutely necessary to make ends meet and Starbucks knows it.&quot;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
