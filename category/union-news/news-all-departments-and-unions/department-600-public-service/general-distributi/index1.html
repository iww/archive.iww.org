</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 01/18/2011 - 3:02am</p>
<p><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Starbucks Workers Union (Industrial Workers of the World). Contact: Zelig Stern, 508-524-2118; Cason Bolton, Jr, 702-490-1732</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/SbuxAstorsm.jpg" align="right" />NEW YORK, NY –On this the 25th anniversary of Dr. King’s holiday, baristas at the Astor Place Starbucks in Manhattan declared their membership in the 105 year old union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a staunch and outspoken defender of workers’ rights including the right to a living wage and the right to join a labor union.</p>
<p>The baristas represent the latest group of workers at the coffee giant to join the ongoing struggle for a living wage, more consistent scheduling, more affordable health insurance, and to be treated with basic respect and dignity by management. “I am proud to join the growing ranks of retail workers organizing together in the largest and least organized sector of our economy and at a company that has created thousands of low-wage jobs,” expressed Astor Place barista Zelig Stern. In the last year, baristas in Omaha, Nebraska and Ft. Worth, Texas have also joined the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU), showing that workers’ concerns with the company are far-reaching.</p>
<p>“We would just like to be treated like human beings and not machines,” said union barista and Astor Place employee Cason Bolton, Jr. in reference to Starbucks’ latest initiative toward mimicking the factory assembly-line, the “Beverage Repeatable Routine.”</p>
<p>Today the workers delivered a collectively written demand letter (see below) to the management of the Astor Place Starbucks. Their demands included a one dollar per an hour raise across the board for all store employees. While the company’s total net revenue for FY 2010 increased by 9.5% to $10.7 billion, according to the company’s Financial Report for Nov. 4, 2010, many of the retail location employees aren’t able to make ends meet with their low Starbucks wages and are forced to live below the poverty line, many requiring public assistance.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/18/2010 - 2:39pm</p>
<p><b>Employees that Work on Dr. King's Holiday will Receive Time-and-One-Half Holiday Pay</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/memphis_king.jpg" align="right" />November 18, 2010 - Contact: Aaron Kocher, 612-220-6454</p>
<p>New York, NY- Starbucks baristas across the United States for the first time next year will begin receiving a time-and-one-half holiday premium for working on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The move comes after a spirited three-year initiative of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) which made public the company's second-class treatment of Dr. King's birthday and called on the coffee giant to pay the same premium that it pays workers on six other federal holidays. After Starbucks refused to change its policy, union workers and their supporters launched a determined campaign of grassroots actions in Starbucks stores and communities all across the country in support of equal treatment for MLK Day.</p>
<p>Starbucks Union members say this is an especially emotional victory, given that the SWU has long-cited the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a major inspiration. Dr. King, who was assassinated in Memphis while supporting the effort of striking sanitation workers to form a union, was a staunch and outspoken defender of workers' rights including the right to a living wage and the right to join a labor union.</p>
<p>"We're deeply moved to have been able in our modest way to increase respect for Dr. King's legacy while ensuring that Starbucks employees who work on his holiday are fairly compensated," said Anja Witek, a Starbucks barista and SWU member in Minnesota. "This is a great example of what baristas and all low-wage workers can achieve by getting organized and taking direct action in support of workplace justice issues."</p>
<p>While Starbucks claims to 'embrace diversity', it doggedly resisted the SWU's call for equal treatment of MLK Day for three years. The company based its refusal on the claim that its holiday policy was in line with the (abysmally low) standards of the food service sector. The SWU made the case that Starbucks' commitment to diversity was illusory, citing the disproportionate number of workers of color in the lowest-paid positions in the company and its intense exploitation of coffee farmers including the Ethiopian workers who grew some of Starbucks' most expensive beans but received just 2.2% of the retail price.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../../../../../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 09/30/2010 - 12:56pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg" align="right" />Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) union barista Jeffrey W. Bauer was wrongfully fired for organizing at Ozzie's Coffee & Tea in New York City on June 29th, 2010.</p>
<p>The NYC IWW has been engaged in a fight for justice for Fellow Worker Jeff Bauer, both through Direct Action and filing Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).</p>
<p><b>PHONE ZAP General Store Manager, Rafael at both Ozzie's locations!!!!</b></p>
<p>Thursday, September 30th. Noon to 5 pm EST call (718) 768-6868 ask for Rafael or available manager.</p>
<p>Friday, October 1st. 10 am to 3 pm EST call (718) 398-6695 Ask for Rafael, Melissa or available manager.</p>
<p>Demand that...</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Union barista Jeff Bauer be immediately reinstated.</li>
<li>2. Ozzie's treat their employees with respect and obey Federal Labor Laws.</li>
<li>3. Stop lying about Jeff Bauer's work ethic to the NLRB and the media.</li>
</ul>
<p>IWW union barista Jeff Bauer worked at Ozzie's for over a year and proved himself to be a hard worker with a strong work ethic. The quality of his labor was never questioned before his union affiliation was leaked to management. In fact, Jeff was offered the General Store Manager position before it was given to Rafael, but turned it down on principal as it went against his political beliefs as both an anarchist and a unionist.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 09/13/2010 - 2:58am</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.workdayminnesota.org.php?news_6_4620" target="_blank">Staff Report - <i>WorkDay Minnesota</i>, Monday 13th September 2010</a></b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns1.jpg" align="right" height="187" width="250" />MINNEAPOLIS - Jimmy John's franchise owners Mike and Rob Mulligan awoke to an unpleasant surprise last week as employees disrupted construction of the newest store in the chain with picket lines.</p>
<p>The picketing sandwich workers appealed to members of Minneapolis building trades unions working on the new store to down their tools until the Mulligans agree to meet with the newly-formed Jimmy Johns Workers Union.</p>
<p>“If Mike and Rob Mulligan have $300,000 to open another Jimmy Johns, then they have the money to meet our demands for a decent wage, consistent hours, and basic fairness at work. If they're not going to meet with us, then we have no choice but to hit them where it hurts. We are happy with the outcome of today's action– construction at the site was delayed for about an hour,” said Davis Ritsema, a member of the union.</p>
<p>Most construction workers employed under a union contract in Minnesota have the right to refuse to cross picket lines. Under Minnesota state law, motor vehicles are required to come to a complete stop at picket lines so that picketers can appeal to the driver not to cross the line.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is the first fast food union in the nation, and is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_38 last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from General Distribution Workers Industrial Union 660.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 09/11/2010 - 3:05am</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg" align="right" />Since Starbucks baristas at the 15th and Douglas store in Omaha announced their membership in the IWW one month ago, Starbucks has unleashed an aggressive union busting campaign on the workers with a particularly extreme effort to intimidate and threaten FW Tyler Swain.</p>
<p>In response to this, all members of the Omaha SWU have voted unanimously to send out an appeal for solidarity to the broader IWW and labor movement. Please show Starbucks that an injury to one is an injury to all by taking the following actions:</p>
<p><b>1. Call Partner Resources Representative Shari Rugi, (314)607-4180</b></p>
<p>Shari Rugi is coordinating a campaign of intimidation and harassment against union members at the 15th and Douglas Starbucks. This intimidation has included fabrication of sexual harassment allegations and interrogation of union members at the store over these accusations concocted by management. Furthermore, Shari Rugi as directed the store manager at 15th and Douglas, Missy Kemp, to tighten policy and increase disciplinary actions against workers, in particular against FW Tyler Swain. Rugi has forced Store Manager Missy Kemp to write up FW Tyler Swain twice since going public for alleged violations of policy, contriving allegations of insubordination, and illegally tightening the time and attendance policy. weeks after these alleged violations have occurred. Union members at the 15th and Douglas location have, on multiple occasions, overheard conversations taking place between the store manager, Missy Kemp, and the partner resource manager, Shari Rugi, in which she has insisted FW Swain be written up for these alleged infractions, regardless of the store managers opinion of the events.</p>
<p>It's time to let Shari Rugi know that we as an organization will not tolerate the unfair and discriminatory treatment of public union members, and that we, as a global organization are well aware of her actions.</p>
<p><b>2. Call District Manager Jennifer Rojas, (402)319-2760</b></p>
<p>The District Manager has repeatedly disrespected workers in her area.</p>
<p>Based upon this level of disrespect, the final demand in the letter presented to management, including the 15th and Douglas store manager Missy Kemp, district manager Jennifer Rojas, and Regional Director of Operations Brett Battes, was a request that Jennifer Rojas resign from her position. A month after the delivery no mention of this demand has been made, despite targeted attempts to separate public union members from the company. It's time to let Jennifer Rojas know that her disrespect to workers in her area does not go unnoticed, and that she needs to be working for noticeable improvements in the working environment she oversees or resign immediately. Specific demands are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the immediate back pay of wages owed to FW Samantha Cole which were promised to her the morning of August 6th in a phone conversation that took place between Jennifer Rojas and Samantha Cole,</li>
<li>an open and cooperative dialogue between levels of management and the Starbucks Workers Union,</li>
<li>an open environment for members of the union to organize without fear of retaliation,</li>
<li>and an increased effort to put into place the district wide 20 percent wage increase that the union is fighting for.</li>
