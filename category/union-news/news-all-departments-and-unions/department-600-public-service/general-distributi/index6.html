</h2>

Chicago, IL (03-19-2009)- The Starbucks Coffee Co. informed outspoken union
member and barista, Joe Tessone, yesterday that it was laying him off, just two
weeks after he confronted CEO Howard Schultz over the company's squeezing of
employees.  Mr. Tessone's blog post on the encounter entitled, &quot;Howard the
Coward: The Day My Boss Ran Away&quot; quickly became an Internet hit among fast food
workers and their supporters (online at: <a target="_blank" href="../../../../../node/4618/">http://www.iww.org/en/node/4618)</a>.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;When I heard Howard Schultz was in town, I knew had to get to the store
and make my voice heard as a barista and union member,&quot; said Tessone, a 4-year
veteran of the company with an excellent performance record. &quot;He said he'd speak
to me after his interview with the Wall Street Journal only to scurry through
the emergency exit the first chance he got.  I told Schultz that it was time to
dialogue with union baristas and that too many of us we're living in poverty but
he showed nothing but cowardice.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
Shortly after his exchange with Schultz, Tessone was ordered into a
one-on-one meeting with a Starbucks Regional Director rather than the store
manager who would normally administer discipline.  The director warned Tessone
that he was out of compliance with Starbucks' new &quot;Optimal Scheduling&quot; policy
which pries open baristas' availability to work without guaranteeing any work
hours.  The problem with the director's rationale: Tessone's availability was
indeed in complete compliance with Optimal Scheduling requirements which are
laid out in a written policy.  The same rationale was erroneously deployed by
Tessone's store manager yesterday when he was laid off.

A National Labor Relations Board regional director in Detroit Jan. 16
approved a settlement agreement with Starbucks Corp. resolving allegations of
unfair labor practices by the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU), an affiliate of the
Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), filed with NLRB Region 7 (Starbucks Corp.
d/b/a Starbucks Coffee Co., N.L.R.B. Reg. Dir., No. 7-CA-51190, settlement
approved 1/16/09).
</div>
<br />
<div>
The NLRB regional office in Detroit had found sufficient evidence to
establish an employer violation of the National Labor Relations Act at a
Starbucks store in Grand Rapids, Mich., according to Stephen Glasser, NLRB
regional director for Region 7.
</div>
<br />
<div>
The Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) filed several charges April
15, one of which NLRB found to be a possible violation of the act. On behalf of
fired worker Cole Dorsey, SWU claimed Starbucks illegally fired a worker who had
been involved in union activities.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Glasser said NLRB concluded there was sufficient evidence to establish
Dorsey was fired for his union activities and support for the union. &quot;We thought
we could prove that,&quot; he told BNA Jan. 9. Starbucks had said it fired Dorsey for
attendance issues, Glasser said.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Reinstatement Not Required.
</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div>
Under the settlement, reached one day before a trial was to be held,
Starbucks will expunge record of the termination from the employee's personnel
file and will post a notice for 60 days at the Grand Rapids, Mich., store
outlining employees' rights under the NLRA.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Under the settlement, Starbucks is not required to reinstate the employee
or issue back pay. Although the union had sought Dorsey's reinstatement, NLRB
determined that it would not be appropriate, Glasser said.

<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/starbuckslogo2.jpg" align="right" /><strong>Media Statement delivered January 7:</strong> Faced with the prospect of losing
another trial in front of the National Labor Relations Board the
Regional Director has agreed to let Starbucks settle the charges
against them and forego the trial that was to begin today. The union is
upset that the Board is agreeing to accept another Starbucks settlement
in Grand Rapids instead of holding them accountable in open court. If
this most recent settlement is approved it will be 3rd one allowed by
the board in Grand Rapids. With the signing of each settlement
Starbucks has said they would end their anti-union intimidation and
each time it has continued unabated. We can be sure it will continue
which is why union membership is so vital.<br />
<br />
Had the trial gone on here today in Grand Rapids we would have detailed
the same type of union busting activity that Starbucks was found guilty
of a couple weeks ago in New York. Internal communications would have
been admitted into evidence showing upper management discussions about
union organizing in Grand Rapids and speculation about barista's union
sympathies. The same type of surveillance and monitoring that was going
on in New York. Also, Starbucks selectively enforced the attendance
policy, scheduled baristas based on their union sympathies, and gave me
less in raises because of my union affiliation. Based on the evidence
that would have been presented its unbelievable that Howard Schultz
doesn't have knowledge of the huge anti-union operation in place at
Starbucks. Its possible hes directing the whole operation.<br />
<br />
On July 5th of last year there was a Global Day of Action against
Starbucks called by the Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union and the
Seville (Spain) CNT. The Day of Action was called after Monica was
fired from a Starbucks in Seville and I was fired here in Grand Rapids.
Over 200 Starbucks were picketed in over 80 cities in 20 countries. We
have a message from the CNT with an update of Monica's situation.<br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_272"><a href="../../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/starbucks/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Starbucks campaign.

</p>
<p>
About a dozen former and current Starbucks workers gathered outside
the coffee chain’s outlet at the intersection of Nicollet and Franklin
avenues on Thursday morning, circling on the sidewalk in the
single-digit temperatures and carrying placards that read “Justice for
Baristas” and “Starbucks Workers Union.”
</p>
<p>
“Starbucks Union here to stay,” they chanted. “These lattes are union-made.”
</p>
<p>
The event coincided with the filing of 11 labor violation charges
against the company with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
Among the accusations against the ubiquitous coffee retailer: Employees
were illegally fired or punished for engaging in union activities;
store managers wrongly prohibited discussions of organizing efforts at
work; and pro-union workers were spied on by management.
</p>
<p>
“Starbucks has flagrantly violated the National Labor Relations Act
on countless occasions,” said Aaron Kocher, an employee at the Nicollet
Avenue shop.

<div>
Statement of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union on the Purchase of a $45
Million Corporate Jet by Starbucks
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;The IWW Starbucks Workers Union is appalled that Starbucks spent $45
million on a new corporate jet so that CEO Howard Schultz could spend the
holidays in Hawaii glad-handing sports superstars while baristas and shift
supervisors are denied the work hours they need to make ends meet in the midst
of an economic crisis.  With that $45 million, Starbucks could provide over five
million additional work hours to employees in need or maintain its gutted 401k
program for three additional years.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Starbucks' new corporate jet only seats 19 passengers.  That leaves out
tens of thousands of us so-called partners.  As a company that claims to treat
all of its employees with &quot;respect and dignity&quot;, Starbucks should sell its
extravagant jet and use the money to benefit its workers and their families, not
just senior executives.  Starbucks should start by scaling back painful
across-the-board labor cuts and maintaining a transparent 401k matching plan, so
that workers know what to expect before they put their money away for
decades.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In today's dire economic climate, there is no room for this kind of
corporate extravagance.  Instead of bearing their share of the burden, Starbucks
management has recklessly chosen to further reward their poor performance.  As
Starbucks wastes much needed funds on unnecessary luxuries, it can expect
increased resistance from baristas and shift supervisors seeking job security
and sufficient work hours.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
The IWW Starbucks Workers Union (StarbucksUnion.org) is an organization of
almost 300 current and former employees at the world's largest coffee chain
united for secure work hours, a living wage, and an independent voice on the
job.  Through direct action, public education, and legal advocacy, the union
fights for systemic change at Starbucks and confronts management over unfair
treatment of individual employees.

open to all working people.
