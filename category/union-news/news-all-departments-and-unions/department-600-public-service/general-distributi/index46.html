<p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/15912-216sm.jpg" />In the latest attempt to scare workers from joining the IWW Starbucks Workers Union, Starbucks has fired two union members in two different stores. Evan Winterscheidt, a 2 year employee at 14<sup>th</sup> st and 6<sup>th</sup> ave and Charles Fostrom at 57<sup>th</sup> st and Lexington ave. The Union demands the immediate reinstatement of both workers and an end to the illegal anti-union activities. </p> <p>The IWW Starbucks Workers Union believes that these two firings are part of an on going anti-union campaign and is filing more unfair labor practices against the company.
