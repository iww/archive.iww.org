</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 06/27/2017 - 5:43pm</p>
<p><strong>By Raleigh-Durham IWOC - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/raleigh-durham-nc-iwoc-friends-picket-nc-department-public-safety/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, June 20, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/FancyIWWConstPosterPT.jpg" align="right" alt="" />Members and supporters of the Raleigh-Durham General Membership Branch (GMB) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) held a picket outside the headquarters of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, 831 W. Morgan Street, in Raleigh, at 12 noon on Friday, June 23rd in solidarity with members and comrades of their union incarcerated in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;soft&rdquo; picket, which did not blockade the street, sidewalk, or the entrance to NCDPS, but which forced DPS workers to walk through the line on their lunch break, was organized by the Raleigh-Durham GMB&rsquo;s local of the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee in response to repression faced by IWW/IWOC members on the inside who are working to form a union, to organize against prison slavery, and make other inside struggles known on the outside.</p>
<p>Also present at the action were organizers for the Millions for Prisoners March on August 19th in Washington DC. Organizers shared the reasoning behind the march and expressed the need for everyone invested in the abolition of prison slavery to either join them in Washington or organize a local march in their hometown. <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/final-straw-august-19th-day-action-millions-for-prisoners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IWOC fully supports the Millions for Prisoners March</a> and will be there in force.</p>
<p>The forms of repression faced by the fellow workers in the NC prison system are diverse, but they all stem directly from decisions made by those who work in the Department of Public Safety, which supervises NC Prisons. Stanley Corbett Jr., for example, writes:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people (officers Synder, Falliner, &amp; Walker, including Sgt. Lancaster) have stopped all of my mail from my family, friends, &amp; associates. It&rsquo;s another form of retaliation, in which their striving to keep me from communicating with society, due to the fact that I&rsquo;m letting the public know what&rsquo;s going on in here. I need you &amp; anyone else that can help me to call this facility, and speak to Mr. Marshall about getting me transferred or swapped.&rdquo; Allen Littlejohn III writes &ldquo;They have pushed my release date back for no reason. I was on 9-29-17 but now they have pushed my release date back to 1-11-18 for no reason. I&rsquo;ve not received a infraction so what is the reason behind these games.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the lead-up to the picket, the Raleigh-Durham IWOC shared some letters written by Fellow Workers currently locked inside the North Carolina prison system. <a href="https://raleighdurhamiwoc.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Those letters can be found here.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Members of the IWW have created the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, or IWOC, which functions as a liaison for prisoners to organize each other, unionize, and build solid bridges between prisoners on the inside and fellow workers on the outside. IWOC has been actively reaching out to prisoners while at the same time prisoners have been reaching out to the IWW for representation and assistance in building a prisoners union. IWOC has taken up the cause and is helping prisoners in every facility organize and build a union branch for themselves, which will together form a powerful IWW Industrial Union.</p>

<a href="../../../../../content/announcement-nationally-coordinated-prisoner-workstoppage-sept-9-2016/" rel="bookmark">Announcement of Nationally Coordinated Prisoner Workstoppage for Sept 9, 2016</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 09/09/2016 - 11:07am</p>
<p><em>This following is a statement from the&nbsp;<a title="IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee" href="https://iwoc.noblogs.org/" rel="home">IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee</a>.</em></p>
<p>Prisoners from across the United States have just released this call to action for a nationally coordinated prisoner workstoppage against prison slavery to take place on September 9th, 2016.</p>
<p>This is a Call to Action Against Slavery in America</p>
<p>In one voice, rising from the cells of long term solitary confinement, echoed in the dormitories and cell blocks from Virginia to Oregon, we prisoners across the United States vow to finally end slavery in 2016.</p>
<p>On September 9th of 1971 prisoners took over and shut down Attica, New York State&rsquo;s most notorious prison. On September 9th of 2016, we will begin an action to shut down prisons all across this country. We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves.</p>
<p>In the 1970s the US prison system was crumbling. In Walpole, San Quentin, Soledad, Angola and many other prisons, people were standing up, fighting and taking ownership of their lives and bodies back from the plantation prisons. For the last six years we have remembered and renewed that struggle. In the interim, the prisoner population has ballooned and technologies of control and confinement have developed into the most sophisticated and repressive in world history. The prisons have become more dependent on slavery and torture to maintain their stability.</p>
<p>Prisoners are forced to work for little or no pay. That is slavery. The 13th amendment to the US constitution maintains a legal exception for continued slavery in US prisons. It states &ldquo;neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.&rdquo; Overseers watch over our every move, and if we do not perform our appointed tasks to their liking, we are punished. They may have replaced the whip with pepper spray, but many of the other torments remain: isolation, restraint positions, stripping off our clothes and investigating our bodies as though we are animals.</p>
<p>Slavery is alive and well in the prison system, but by the end of this year, it won&rsquo;t be anymore. This is a call to end slavery in America. This call goes directly to the slaves themselves. We are not making demands or requests of our captors, we are calling ourselves to action. To every prisoner in every state and federal institution across this land, we call on you to stop being a slave, to let the crops rot in the plantation fields, to go on strike and cease reproducing the institutions of your confinement.</p>
<p>This is a call for a nation-wide prisoner work stoppage to end prison slavery, starting on September 9th, 2016. They cannot run these facilities without us.</p>
<p>Non-violent protests, work stoppages, hunger strikes and other refusals to participate in prison routines and needs have increased in recent years. The 2010 Georgia prison strike, the massive rolling California hunger strikes, the Free Alabama Movement&rsquo;s 2014 work stoppage, have gathered the most attention, but they are far from the only demonstrations of prisoner power. Large, sometimes effective hunger strikes have broken out at Ohio State Penitentiary, at Menard Correctional in Illinois, at Red Onion in Virginia as well as many other prisons. The burgeoning resistance movement is diverse and interconnected, including immigrant detention centers, women&rsquo;s prisons and juvenile facilities. Last fall, women prisoners at Yuba County Jail in California joined a hunger strike initiated by women held in immigrant detention centers in California, Colorado and Texas.</p>
<p>Prisoners all across the country regularly engage in myriad demonstrations of power on the inside. They have most often done so with convict solidarity, building coalitions across race lines and gang lines to confront the common oppressor.</p>
<p>Forty-five years after Attica, the waves of change are returning to America&rsquo;s prisons. This September we hope to coordinate and generalize these protests, to build them into a single tidal shift that the American prison system cannot ignore or withstand. We hope to end prison slavery by making it impossible, by refusing to be slaves any longer.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we need support from people on the outside. A prison is an easy-lockdown environment, a place of control and confinement where repression is built into every stone wall and chain link, every gesture and routine. When we stand up to these authorities, they come down on us, and the only protection we have is solidarity from the outside. Mass incarceration, whether in private or state-run facilities is a scheme where slave catchers patrol our neighborhoods and monitor our lives. It requires mass criminalization. Our tribulations on the inside are a tool used to control our families and communities on the outside. Certain Americans live every day under not only the threat of extra-judicial execution&mdash;as protests surrounding the deaths of Mike Brown, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and so many others have drawn long overdue attention to&mdash;but also under the threat of capture, of being thrown into these plantations, shackled and forced to work.</p>
<p>Our protest against prison slavery is a protest against the school to prison pipeline, a protest against police terror, a protest against post-release controls. When we abolish slavery, they&rsquo;ll lose much of their incentive to lock up our children, they&rsquo;ll stop building traps to pull back those who they&rsquo;ve released. When we remove the economic motive and grease of our forced labor from the US prison system, the entire structure of courts and police, of control and slave-catching must shift to accommodate us as humans, rather than slaves.</p>
<p>Prison impacts everyone, when we stand up and refuse on September 9th, 2016, we need to know our friends, families and allies on the outside will have our backs. This spring and summer will be seasons of organizing, of spreading the word, building the networks of solidarity and showing that we&rsquo;re serious and what we&rsquo;re capable of.</p>
<p>Step up, stand up, and join us.<br />
Against prison slavery.<br />
For liberation of all.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 10/08/2015 - 3:11pm</p>
<p><strong>By Kevin Rashid Johnson - <a href="../p%3d1251/" target="_blank">Kevin Rashid Johnson</a>, June 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/GDc.jpg" alt="" />I have, as an active leading member of the New Afrikan Black Panther Party &ndash; Prison Chapter (NABPP-PC), recently joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) upon its founding the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC).<sup><a title="Article II, sec. 1.c. of the IWW Constitution permits membership to unpaid officers of political parties." class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_0_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_0_1251">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The IWOC&rsquo;s stated purpose is to &ldquo;function [ ] as a liaison for prisoners to organize each other, unionize, and build solid bridges between prisoners on the inside and fellow workers on the outside.&rdquo;<sup><a title="The Incarcerated Worker, Vol. 1, No. 1, January 2015, p.1" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_1_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_1_1251">2</a></sup>&nbsp; To this end the IWW has recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners are on the front lines of wage slavery and forced slave labor where refusal to work while in prison results in inhumane retaliation and participation in slave labor contributes to the mechanisms of exploitation. The [IWW] has consciously grasped the importance of organizing prisoners so that prisoners can directly challenge prison slavery, work conditions, and the system itself: break cycles of criminalization, exploitation, and the state sponsored divisions of our working class.&nbsp; At the same time, the prison environment and culture is a melting pot of capitalistic and exploitative tactics and all forms of oppression.&nbsp; These poisons must be challenged in prisons, institutions, and in all of us, through organized working class solidarity.&rdquo;<sup><a title="Ibid." class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_2_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_2_1251">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NABPP-PC has unity with this line and purpose, and allies with the IWW to these and broader ends.&nbsp; Indeed we have for years advanced the idea of extending union membership to prisoners.<sup><a title="See, Kevin &ldquo;Rashid&rdquo; Johnson, Promoting Proletarian Consciousness as Prisoner Rehabilitation (2007), http://rashidmod.com/?p=374" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_3_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_3_1251">4</a></sup> So the IWOC&rsquo;s founding is right on time!</p>
<p>The NABPP-PC is not a traditional communist party, but rather a pre-party formation that advances the cause of revolutionary intercommunalism, and whose target base is the oppressed urban masses and prisoners (the lumpen and unemployed in particular<sup><a title="For an analysis of our line on the lumpen and the proletariat as our mass base, see, Kevin &ldquo;Rashid&rdquo; Johnson, The NABPP-PC: Our Line (2005), http://rashidmod.com/?p=286" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_4_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_4_1251">5</a></sup> ) of all nationalities, &ldquo;races,&rdquo; etc., but especially New Afrikans/Blacks.&nbsp; Within the NABPP-PC we have the White Panther Organization (WPO) and Brown Panther Organizing Committee (BPOC), which operate as arms of the NABPP-PC to bring our line and strategy to all other oppressed peoples.</p>
<p>The NABPP-PC is guided by the ideological and political line of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM).&nbsp; We unite in camaraderie with all whom we can to oppose the oppressive capitalist imperialist system, racism and repression, whether they share our line or not.</p>
<p>Various strata of the working class in Amerika have been spontaneously rising in protest against unsatisfactory work conditions and wages.&nbsp; From those in the lower service trades, to teachers, to public sector workers.&nbsp; Many have been oriented to more radical politics than mere trade unionism which only aspires to workplace and wage reforms.&nbsp; This was evidenced in the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in September 2011 and quickly spread across Amerika.&nbsp; Various &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; sectors have been reaching for political lines that address greater social ills like capitalist driven environmental crisis, imperialist wars, the proliferation of &ldquo;terroristic&rsquo; violence especially in regions of the world destabilized by the policies and actions of the US and its allies, police violence, sexism, prevailing racism, mass imprisonment, etc. Only a thoroughgoing revolutionary political line can connect clear analyses and solutions with these questions.</p>
