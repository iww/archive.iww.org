</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/22/2018 - 7:46pm</p>
<p><strong>By Joanna Nu&ntilde;ez - Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, August 10, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/320x196x5-15-1068x654.jpg.pagespeed.ic.7lPE1Hy4_x/" alt="" align="right" />The lockdown at Stillwater Prison is now in its 27th day. As <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/08/11/stillwater-prison-conditions-complaints/" target="_blank">families</a> and <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/?cat=1" target="_blank">prisoners</a> demand an end to the lockdown the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee is releasing <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1307eAreXim7tDMeLivaqHy1vmJ5DwsaM/view" target="_blank">audio</a> from inside Stillwater prison to showcase the urgency of the lockdown&rsquo;s immediate end and to expose the lies being spread by the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC). The audio, shared by Stillwater inmate Tony, last name removed due to concerns for retaliation, was received on August 11th.</p>
<p>This audio interview - along with other independent reports from prisoners in Stillwater - document human rights violations, the power of the media&rsquo;s impact in changing conditions inside, and, as Stillwater prisoner Carlos Smith says, that the &ldquo;[DOC] spokesperson is not being truthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Multiple independent reports from prisoners contradict the claims made by the DOC in an August 10th statement to KSTP. A DOC representative said prisoners are receiving <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/" target="_blank">&ldquo;showers every 3 days and were given hygiene bags as well as fresh linens&rdquo;</a>. Yet, prisoners report not having received more than three showers in 24 days of being locked down. Nor have Smith or Tony received clean clothes. Smith shared, &ldquo;Our clothes are mildewed because we have only had the chance to wash them once in the last 24 days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conditions inside Stillwater sound nightmarish. A prisoner who wishes to remain anonymous reports &ldquo;the stench in the units from the garbage is gagging. Fruit flies are abundant and everywhere. Toiletries are not passed out daily. Some days you find yourself having to ask your neighbors for toilet paper... [which] is prohibited&rdquo;.</p>
<p>During lockdowns prisoners are supposed to be in cells a brutal twenty three hours a day. Yet Tony reports they were &ldquo;locked in their cells...for 20 days straight&rdquo; without proper medical supervision, and when displaced for searches prisoners were surrounded by staff &ldquo;with automatic weapons and several canines&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A prisoner who wishes to remain anonymous says he &ldquo;can't stand by and allow the DOC to lie to the public, bolstering their own image to request more money off my pain and suffering. I am paying my dues to society and now the DOC's the one victimizing me for their own personal gain.&rdquo; He asks that &ldquo;[you] report the truth to the public. Open their eyes to our plight and the problem of warehousing over reintegration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some prisoners see progress being forced by stories in the news, including their first hour out of their cells during the day. &ldquo;A lot of change has occurred as people understand what is going on inside the prisons [from the TV]&rdquo; Tony reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The DOC says they are <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/" target="_blank">&ldquo;transitioning off of lockdown&rdquo;</a> but it is <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/" target="_blank">&ldquo;a process without a definitive end date&rdquo;</a>. Prisoners and their families are not willing to wait. The Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd6AsfZOtpz-ypwvJ03fe5FadjGzSJko0L6V2yI2EM1Ix0sQ/viewform" target="_blank">circulating a petition</a> demanding the DOC immediately end the lockdown at Stillwater. IWOC is calling for an emergency meeting this Sunday at 7pm for family and friends of prisoners in Stillwater to end the lockdown. &ldquo;The DOC is preventing prisoners from speaking out so we will do whatever is necessary to make their conditions heard&rdquo;, says Joanna Nu&ntilde;ez of the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 08/13/2018 - 7:59pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, August 10, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/320x196x5-15-1068x654.jpg.pagespeed.ic.7lPE1Hy4_x/" width="320" height="196" align="right" alt="" />As the Minnesota Department of Corrections <a href="https://kstp.com/news/department-of-corrections-lockdown-lifted-at-all-minnesota-prisons-except-stillwater/5020877/" target="_blank">ends its lockdown at all prisons except</a> Stillwater, prisoners there are speaking out against human rights abuses and calling for the lockdown to end.</p>
<p>According to Carlos Smith, a prisoner at Stillwater, &ldquo;we are currently without any basic humane treatment here... We still have not received any showers nor are we any closer to seeing any end to this nonsense.&rdquo; Stillwater has been locked down since <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stillwater-inmate-kills-corrections-officer/488544421/" target="_blank">a lone prisoner killed a guard</a> on July 18. When facilities are on lockdown, prisoners receive no more than one hour a day outside their cells.</p>
<p>Smith says prisoners are being held hostage in a struggle between the DOC and AFSCME prison guards, some of whom are <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/crime-and-courts/4478582-prison-shutters-site-death-stillwater-prison-may-re-purpose-workshop" target="_blank">calling for the resignation of the commissioner</a><span style="font-family:&#xA;&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black">. </span></p>
<p>Beyond the lack of laundry and showers, the 1600 men inside Stillwater are facing humiliation during the lockdown. &ldquo;They took two sections, about sixty of us, handcuffed together, naked. Then we sat like that in the gym for an hour and a half while they ransacked our cells,&rdquo; Smith reports.</p>
<p>AFSCME, the prison guard union is looking for a <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/crime-and-courts/4478582-prison-shutters-site-death-stillwater-prison-may-re-purpose-workshop" target="_blank">bigger budget for staffing</a> but David Boehnke of the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee doesn&rsquo;t believe staffing alone will reduce violence. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give respect, you won&rsquo;t get it. Overcrowding means reduced programming and inhuman conditions - violence which begets violence,&rdquo; Boehnke says. &ldquo;The solution is there. Release the thousands of people locked up for petty parole violations and reinvest that money into improving conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A 2017 study from California prisons notes a <a href="http://economics.ucr.edu/job_candidates/Kurzfeld-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">robust relationship between reducing overcrowding and lowering prison violence</a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black">. Minnesota prisons are already above maximum capacity, resulting in hundreds of people being housed in <a href="http://www.startribune.com/state-s-prisoners-decry-aimless-limbo-in-county-jails/371865301/" target="_blank">county jails</a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black"> while the prison population is projected to be <a href="http://www.startribune.com/prison-overcrowding-to-get-worse/371844582/" target="_blank">more than 1,300 people over maximum capacity by 2022</a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black">. As of July 2018 <a href="https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota Department of Corrections Adult Prison Population Summary 7-1-2018_tcm1089-347924.pdf" target="_blank">35.6% of Minnesota&rsquo;s prison admissions</a>, 2771 people, were incarcerated for crimeless <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-41909583/stories-from-the-inside-rolling-us-out-and-right-back-in" target="_blank">technical violations of parole</a>. </span></span></span></p>
<p>Beyond the recent killing, both guards and prisoners are facing increasing violence inside Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons. Without changing conditions, it is hard to see an end rising violence. But right now, Smith hopes the public will speak up to end the lockdown and its human rights abuses. &ldquo;We are just sitting in these cells smelling like billy goats,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/01/2018 - 7:23pm</p>
<p><strong>By IWOC - <a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/want-to-stop-violence-in-minnesota-prisons-free-our-people/"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, July 31, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/5-15-1068x654.jpg" width="320" height="196" align="right" alt="" />Editorial from the Twin Cities chapter of the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) that links horrific conditions inside with ongoing violence.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>On July 18, <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/assault-corrections-officer-stillwater-minnesota-department-of-corrections/4993759/">the first prison guard in Minnesota&rsquo;s history was killed</a>, on top of recent violence in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaaltv.com/news/attacks-assault-oak-parks-prison-rise-officers-police-riot-inmates-sad/4872337/">Oak Park Heights</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/minnesota-inmate-accused-in-guards-death-has-violent-past/ar-AAAisdK">Stillwater prisons</a>. Yet all the DOC does is ask for <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/department-corrections-commissioner-tom-roy-plans-request-more-funding-from-legislature-again/5006544/">more money</a> on top of their <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/deadly-prison-attack-stillwater-joseph-gomm-minnesota-department-corrections/4996735/">1.2 billion dollar budget</a>. We need a new approach to change in Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons. Stop putting money into a violent institution that is not correcting anyone. Free our people, and reinvest savings into reentry and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>For those of us who have been incarcerated or in regular contact with Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons, recent violence is not a surprise &ndash; it&rsquo;s an inevitability due to the behavior of the prisons system itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons have gotten progressively worse. Lip service to rehabilitation has little application to daily realities, while harsher parole practices, sentencing, and increased criminalization of our communities have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2015/06/minnesota-crime-50-year-low-so-why-are-we-imprisoning-more-people-ever">manufactured an overcrowding crisis</a>. And our people are dying. Between 2000-2013,<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/naacpmpls/posts/2083555125298992"> 280 people incarcerated in Minnesota prisons were killed</a> &ndash; 75% of them due to medical neglect. Yet we spend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vera.org/publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends-prison-spending">$41,366 per incarcerated person each year</a>.</li>
<li>Many prison guards in Minnesota are racist and abusive. The day before the killing at Stillwater, a prisoner reported that the man killed was telling everyone that &ldquo;guards can do whatever we want to you and you can&rsquo;t do anything about it&rdquo;. Last year the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee released a <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-41909583/stories-from-the-inside-because-they-have-the-badge">podcast</a> just scratching the surface of guard abuse in Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons.</li>
<li>It is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2014/apr/15/lowering-recidivism-through-family-communication/">well documented</a>, including by the <a target="_blank" href="https://mn.gov/doc/family-visitor/visiting-information/">MN DOC</a>, that increased community connection reduces recidivism. Yet the MN DOC regularly prevents mail delivery, makes visiting miserable, and represses prisoner and community attempts to build bridges with each other. Results are predictable: <a target="_blank" href="http://justicelab.iserp.columbia.edu/states/Minnesota.html">48% of people released on parole end up back in prison</a>, a shocking <a target="_blank" href="https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota Department of Corrections Adult Prison Population Summary 1-1-2018_tcm1089-323881.pdf">88% of them</a> for minor &ldquo;technical violations&rdquo; of parole, not new crimes. Even DOC employees are saying <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inforum.com/news/crime-and-courts/4474871-coworkers-vow-fight-more-staff-minnesota-prison-where-guard-was-killed">low staffing</a> in overcrowded conditions are creating extreme dangers for prisoners and staff, while a <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/deadly-prison-attack-stillwater-joseph-gomm-minnesota-department-corrections/4996735/">rash of quitting</a> has followed the recent killing.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s an easy solution to these violent conditions &ndash; free our people. Instead of putting yet more money into prisons we should immediately release all people in prison for crimeless &ldquo;technical violations&rdquo; of parole and nonviolent crimes, <a target="_blank" href="https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota Department of Corrections Adult Prison Population Summary 1-1-2018_tcm1089-323881.pdf">at least 40% of the population</a>. Savings should fund successful reentry and rehabilitation programs. The parole system must be changed to ensure everyone has the opportunity to earn a life worth living. <i>(Learn more about </i><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3hCKJLltmvYVdMGy_g1LZO983Eu7VLzL7ZyK4zhLyosHEkg/viewform"><i>this fight</i></a><i> on Saturday August 25th, 1-3pm in North Minneapolis &ndash; </i><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11PWiDRkGprkmkV_qEFPd2ZUPVScjDX4D/view"><i>flier</i></a><i> and </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/227466424566704/"><i>facebook</i></a><i>).</i></p>
<p>Nor can conditions be improved without prisoners having real power and community connections. Prisoners should be allowed to form their own unions and represent themselves. Community groups and family members should be welcomed. Visiting hours should be expanded, while mail censorship must end.</p>
<p>This August 21st &ndash; September 9th, prisoners around the country are <a target="_blank" href="http://prisonstrike.com/">going on strike</a> against inhuman conditions confirmed by prisoners&rsquo; legal status as slaves under the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">13th am</a><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">endment to the US Constitution</a>. Will Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons join other systems in regular deadly violence between slaves and their cagers? Or will we treat humans like human beings, stop senseless incarceration, and use savings for rehabilitation and community? We say slavery must end &ndash; free our people!</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Industrial Workers of the World&rsquo;s (IWW) Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) is excited to announce our first Incarcerated Workers Industrial Union 613 branch application. The charter is currently being reviewed by the IWW's General Executive Board. When approved, this will be the first ever IU613 Branch in IWW history. In fact it will be the very first Incarcerated Workers union branch period. Below is their announcement of the formation and a riveting history of prison organizing over the past few decades.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS &amp; FELLOW WORKERS,</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On behalf of &ldquo;Mandingo Warriors &amp; Associates&mdash;IWW/IWOC,&rdquo; we would like to express our most sincere gratitude and appreciation regarding the valuable time, efforts and sacrifices that you, along with the entire IWW/IWOC revolutionary family of this Struggle, have put into this difficult and complex &ldquo;dilemma&rdquo; of pursuing the necessary steps required to &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; assist in the organizing of those of us, whom are incarcerated within the numerous &ldquo;Business Corporations&rdquo; disguised as &ldquo;Reformative Institutions&rdquo; (Aka Prisons), around Unifying Principles and a Universal Philosophy that is inclusive of all of Humanity (this is definitely a Struggle Rooted in Equality for all of Humanity and not just the Few &amp; Wealthy!)&hellip;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall hope and pray that all of our Comrades, in the &ldquo;Semi-Free Society,&rdquo; are doing well and are enjoying the best of health possible. Your most recent communication (dated: 10/20/&rsquo;17) was well received and we look forward to receiving future communications from any and all IWW/IWOC members (with a robust invitation to the African People&rsquo;s Caucus) in the near future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before We/I begin to address your most recent letter, Comrade it is our responsibility to inform and make you guys aware of the latest developments concerning the Movement of our Branch&hellip; You guys will have no doubt noticed the change in name/title&mdash;&ldquo;Mandingo Warriors &amp; Associates&mdash;IWW/IWOC&rdquo; (M.W.A.&mdash;IWW/IWOC), from the previous name-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting was held, 10/27/&rsquo;17, in response to your letter and concerning IWW/IWOC&rsquo;s agenda in general. Amongst the few issues that were discussed and resolved, included the uncertainty of some, as-to whether IWW/IWOC represent the realities of True Revolutionary Movement, or, will the Tribe (another name used to describe the entirety of the M.W organization)&mdash;as a Revolutionary organization in-and-of-itself, be bounding itself, by mutual agreement, to Honor, Respect, Uphold and abide by the Constitution, By-Laws, Principles and General Philosophy (whenever related to IWW affairs) of a bunch of &ldquo;Armchair&rdquo; Revolutionaries, who pontificate upon revolutionary concepts, but, fall far short of actual Revolutionary Movement (The Tribe has been &ldquo;burnt&rdquo; by such &ldquo;revolutionary organizations&rdquo; before, in which &ldquo;they talk a good game,&rdquo; but, when the &ldquo;heat&rdquo; is turned-up they are &nbsp;nowhere to be found&hellip;)&hellip;</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/17/2018 - 9:14pm</p>
<p><strong>By Julia Conley - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/01/15/inmates-launch-month-long-strike-protest-slavery-conditions-florida-prisons"><em>Common Dreams</em></a>, January 14, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://ecology.iww.org/images/OpPush1.jpg" width="320" height="213" align="right" alt="" />Inmates in Florida's prisons launched a month-long strike on Monday in protest of the state's use of &quot;modern day slavery&quot; within its correctional facilities.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" href="https://fighttoxicprisons.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/fl-prisoners-announce-operation-push-starting-jan-15-to-cripple-prison-system/">statement</a> released by the Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons, one of several advocacy groups supporting the movement, the state's prisoners urged the prison population to refuse all work assignments during the strike:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are encouraging prisoners throughout the DOC to band together in an effort to demand payment for work performances...Our goal is to make the Governor realize that it will cost the state of Florida millions of dollars daily to contract outside companies to come and cook, clean, and handle the maintenance. This will cause a total BREAK DOWN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>African-Americans make up about a third of Florida's prison population, despite accounting for only about 17 percent of the state's overall population. Calling their movement Operation Push, after Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1970s campaign to improve the economic status of African-Americans, the state's inmates are fighting against the Department of Corrections' price-gouging practices and Florida's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/syndicated/2016/05/21/dockery-bring-back-parole-florida/84653180/">elimination of parole</a> as well as its use of unpaid labor by prisoners.</p>
<p>Florida is one of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/">five states</a> that offers no payment to inmates for their work&mdash;from washing prison uniforms and cooking meals to completing maintenance work and serving on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/unpaid-florida-prison-inmates-being-used-on-hurricane-irma-cleanup-labor-crews-9701867">cleanup crews</a> after Hurricane Irma hit the state last September.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a word for that, it's called slavery,&quot; Paul Wright, executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/florida-prisoners-martin-luther-king-day-strike-slavery">told</a> the <em>Guardian.</em> &quot;Some states might say they pay 10 cents a day, or 15 cents an hour, or whatever, but here they make it pretty clear they don't pay prisoners anything, they're not going to, and prisoners are totally enslaved at every level.&quot;</p>
<p>On top of receiving no compensation for their work, inmates&mdash;and their families&mdash;have to come up with money to afford food and other items sold in prisons.</p>
<p>&quot;We can no longer allow the state to take advantage of our families' hard earned money by over-charging us,&quot; wrote the inmates in their statement. &quot;Take for example: one case of soup on the street cost $4.00. It costs us $17.00 on the inside. This is highway robbery without a gun. It's not just us that they&rsquo;re taking from. It's our families who struggle to make ends meet and send us money&mdash;they are the real victims that the state of Florida is taking advantage of.&quot;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter, several local chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America, and Florida State University's NAACP chapter are among more than 100 groups that have announced their support for the movement. Many of the groups planned to hold a rally with inmates' friends and families at the state's Department of Corrections on Tuesday.</p>
