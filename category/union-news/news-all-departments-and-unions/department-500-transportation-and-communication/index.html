<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 10/13/2011 - 4:39pm</p>
<p>Greetings Fellow Workers,</p>
<p dir="ltr">On behalf of our Union, the Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World stand in solidarity with the United States Postal Workers Union and its effort to preserve the peoples post office from further privatization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 1967 U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a Commission on Postal Reorganization, chaired by AT&amp;T&rsquo;s Frederick R. Kappel, to &ldquo;determine whether the postal system as presently organized is capable of meeting the demands of our growing economy and our expanding population.&rdquo; In June 1968, the Commission found that it was not.[1]</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_696 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/richmond-gmb/" rel="tag" title="">Richmond GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_6 last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for Department 500 - Transportation and Communication.

<a href="../../../../node/5149/" rel="bookmark">Bay Area Industrial Workers of the World Statement in Support of Justice for Oscar Grant and Oct 23rd Oakland Labor Rally</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 08/07/2010 - 2:53am</p>
<p><b>The following Resolution was adopted by a unanimous voice vote at its August 2010 General Membership Branch Meeting held Thursday, August 5, 2010:</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/anarchism/police_brutality01.gif" align="right" border=1 height=146 width=211 />[Begin]</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) acknowledge that police violence is a tragic yet common occurrence in working class communities and for people of color. A notable example took place January 1, 2009, when BART police officer Johannes Mehserle brutality shot and killed 22-year-old Oscar Grant without justification. Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and will be sentenced November 5, 2010.</p>
<p>The IWW firmly rejects police violence and stands beside the family and friends of Oscar Grant. In recognizing that ‘an injury to one is an injury to all’ the IWW is in solidarity with organized labor and members of the Bay Area community who seek justice for Oscar Grant and jail for Johannes Mehserle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the IWW strongly supports the planned demonstration by labor and community groups Saturday October 23, 2010 at Oakland City Hall and joins in the call to ‘jail killer cops.’</p>
<p>[End]</p>
<p><u>Note:</u> The original call out was made by ILWU Local 10,
AFL-CIO</p>

He was warmly greeted by his family and colleagues.<br /><br />Ossanlou&rsquo;s release comes following seven months of struggle without let up by Tehran&rsquo;s bus workers and the massive international solidarity that took shape for his release over this period. He was jailed for organising the bus workers and defending their rights. His release is a clear victory for the workers and people in Iran.<br /><br />In a statement released today, WPI congratulated Mansoor Ossanlou, his family, the bus workers and all trade unions, organisations and individuals who fought in the great campaign for his release. &ldquo;Ossanlou was freed from prison by the bus workers and all those fantastic people in Iran and outside Iran who fought hard and put pressure on the Islamic Republic&rdquo;, the statement said. It called for the unconditional release of all political prisoners in Iran, the recognition of the bus workers&rsquo; union and an end to the persecution of labour activists.<br /><br />Ends.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />International Labour Solidarity Committee of the <br />Worker-communist Party of Iran <br />Co-ordinator: Shahla Daneshfar (shahla_daneshfar@yahoo.com) <br />Public Relations: Bahram Soroush (b.soroush@ukonline.co.uk) <br /><a href="http://www.kargarn.org/">www.kargarn.org</a> <a href="http://www.wpiran.org/">www.wpiran.org</a><br /><br /><a href="http://lnn.laborstart.org/more.php?id=778_0_1_0_M">http://lnn.laborstart.org/more.php?id=778_0_1_0_M</a></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_6 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for Department 500 - Transportation and Communication.

The end-of-century deindustrialization of the United States and importation of cheap commodities from the Far East through the West Coast reversed historical east-west transportation patterns and established Los Angeles and Long Beach as the largest ports in the nation. To minimize transportation costs, which for many products are higher than the cost of production, intermodal transportation of containerized imports was developed. Manufactured goods are packed into mobile shipping containers at factories in the Far East and travel by ship, train, and truck to distribution centers and, ultimately, consumer outlets across the United States. Currently, intermodal transportation of cheap imported commodities is the lifeline of the American economy. In 2004, the Port of Los Angeles processed 7.3 million container units and Long Beach handled 5.8 million. These two ports alone accounted for 68 percent of the West Coast total and are, by far, the largest employers in California. U.S. workers, who have seen so many lucrative manufacturing jobs moved overseas, assumed that import transportation and distribution jobs could not be offshored and were, therefore, relatively secure.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_6 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for Department 500 - Transportation and Communication.
