<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/11/2012 - 4:25pm</p>
<p><strong>By Andy Piascik</strong></p>
<p><em>This story will appear in the March 2012 issue of the </em><a href="../../../projects/IW/">Industrial Worker</a><em>. </em></p>
<p><img align="right" vspace="5" border="0" hspace="5" alt="" src="https://www.edb.utexas.edu/faculty/salinas/students/student_sites/Spring2005/Lawrence_Strike_of_1912/iwwx01.jpg" />One hundred years ago, in the dead of a Massachusetts winter, the great 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike&mdash;commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Bread and Roses&rdquo; strike&mdash;began. Accounts differ as to whether a woman striker actually held a sign that read &ldquo;We Want Bread and We Want Roses, Too.&rdquo; No matter. It&rsquo;s a wonderful phrase, as appropriate for the Lawrence strikers as for any group at any time: the notion that, in addition to the necessities for survival, people should have &ldquo;a sharing of life&rsquo;s glories,&rdquo; as James Oppenheim put it in his poem &ldquo;Bread and Roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though 100 years have passed, the Lawrence strike resonates as one of the most important in the history of the United States. Like many labor conflicts of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the strike was marked by obscene disparities in wealth and power, open collusion between the state and business owners, large scale violence against unarmed strikers, and great ingenuity and solidarity on the part of workers. In important ways, though, the strike was also unique. It was the first large-scale industrial strike, the overwhelming majority of the strikers were immigrants, most were women and children, and the strike was guided in large part by the revolutionary strategy and vision of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</p>
<p>Beyond its historical significance, elements of this massive textile strike may be instructive to building a radical working class movement today. It is noteworthy that the Occupy movement shares many philosophical and strategic characteristics with the Lawrence strike&mdash;direct action, the prominent role of women, the centrality of class, participatory decision-making, egalitarianism, an authentic belief in the Wobbly principle that We Are All Leaders&mdash;to name just a few. During the two months of the strike, the best parts of the revolutionary movement the IWW aspired to build were expressed. The Occupy movement carries that tradition forward, and as the attempt at a general strike in Oakland and solidarity events such as in New York for striking Teamsters indicate, many in Occupy understand that the working class is uniquely positioned to challenge corporate power. While we deepen our understanding of what that means and work to make it happen, there is much of value we can learn from what happened in Lawrence a century ago.</p>

</blockquote></div>
<p>Oakland, California has historically suffered by being in the shadow of the golden allure of San Francisco across the Bay. From the Gold Rush to the Summer of Love to the Castro District as a Gay Mecca to the Dot.com Boom, San Francisco has been known around the world as a magnet for get-rich-quick dreamers, bohemians and idealists. Berkeley, bordering Oakland on the north, was the birthplace of radical student agitation throughout the 1960s, beginning with the Free Speech Movement on the University of California campus in 1964. Oakland has always been a gritty industrial town, whose working class residents have ranged from reactionary whites in the Ku Klux Klan (in the 1920s) and Hells Angels (after World War II) to blacks at the cutting edge of civil rights struggles, and today is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the U.S. Oakland was thrust onto the world stage in 1966 with the Black Panther Party and its militant self-defense of the African American community.</p>
<p>The radical history of the Bay Area is like a giant tapestry and its threads run through the whole region. Telegraph Avenue is 4.4 miles long; it merges into Broadway at Latham Square on the Oakland end, the exact location of the strike of women retail clerks at two department stores on either side that sparked the 1946 General Strike. That strike led to the Taft-Hartley Act (the 1947 federal law banning strike and solidarity tactics that make general strikes possible) six months later and was the beginning of Cold War politics that smothered class struggle for a generation. On the Berkeley side, Telegraph ends at Bancroft Way right at Sproul Plaza on the U.C. Berkeley campus. Exactly 18 years later, on the exact day that the Oakland General Strike was officially declared, December 3rd, the Cold War began to thaw in a mass arrest of over 800 (the largest mass arrest up to that time in California) at a Free Speech Movement sit-in at Sproul Hall. Several of those student protestors had been radicalized by participating in Civil Rights organizing in the Deep South for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE); many had taught at Freedom Schools. For the rest of the sixties, U.C. Berkeley was shut down several times due to mass student strikes and protests, including a month-long occupation of People&rsquo;s Park by the National Guard, sending waves outwards as the youth revolt spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>Even within Oakland, the tapestry has threads that are deeply rooted in previous periods of heightened class struggle, having cross-fertilized with other radical movements across the country, as well as the world. Being that San Francisco is at the tip of a narrow peninsula, surrounded on three sides by water, Oakland became the mainland terminus of the transcontinental railroad when it was completed in 1869. Trains ran along 7th Street through West Oakland to the Mole, a railroad wharf complex extending into the Bay where ferries completed the journey west to San Francisco. During the nationwide Pullman Railroad Strike of 1894, workers occupied the tracks around the Mole, disabled trains, and the whole community prepared to defend the strike. In subsequent years, landfill pushed further into the Bay and the site of the Mole is at the heart of the current Port of Oakland, the destination of our mass march and shutdown during the attempted General Strike on November 2nd.</p>
<p>The Black Panthers had a significant base in West Oakland, where massive railroad yards had been built at the western terminus of the transcontinental line. A thread, although tenuous, connected them with the legacy of African American railroad porters who settled there a generation before. The area became the West Coast organizing center for the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, a socialist union founded in 1925. The Brotherhood came out of the radical ferment of that era; in October 1919 Brotherhood founder A. Philip Randolph wrote in <span style="font-style:italic">The Messenger</span>, &ldquo;The Negroes and the Industrial Workers of the World have interests not only in common, but interests that are identical.&rdquo; The IWW, whose member are called &ldquo;Wobblies,&rdquo; is an interracial revolutionary union founded in 1905 in Chicago that adopted a class struggle approach to organizing through direct action and the strike weapon, striving towards class consciousness and the general strike, with the ultimate goal  being the creation of a classless society.</p>
<p>The Wobbly spirit &ndash; best embodied in the opening lines of the IWW preamble: &ldquo;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common&rdquo; &ndash; was pervasive in the Bay Area, especially in the class unity, solidarity actions, sympathy strikes that exploded into many mass strikes and in turn led to at least two full-blow general strikes. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img height="390" align="right" width="250" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/clock.jpg" />By John Reimann</strong> - <em>Fellow Worker Reimann has been involved with Occupy Oakland, along with several other members of the Bay Area IWW since its inception. The opinions expressed here are the author's alone, though they generally reflect the views of many others who are active in&nbsp;OO&nbsp;and are rank and file union members.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The port shut down of Dec. 12 showed that there is a lot of support for and strength in the Occupy Oakland movement. Sometimes, though, the greatest problems for a movement can arise exactly out of the successes, when we don&rsquo;t think enough about what problems there are.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Worker Participation Necessary</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The port shut down was accomplished with the active involvement of almost none of the workers there, especially the longshore workers. This can become a critical weakness if actions continue against employers and those actions don&rsquo;t come from the workers themselves. In fact, there were several reports that a layer of the longshore workers were somewhat hostile to the Occupy pickets, who were causing them to lose a day&rsquo;s pay.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">This cannot continue. We cannot continue to act in the place of workers; we must find a way to draw in a wider layer of working class Oakland. If we don&rsquo;t, we will alienate large sectors of the working class.</i></b><b style=""><i style="">&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In order to do this, we should make a drive into the work places. Where there are unions and where officials of those unions claim to support Occupy Oakland, we should ask them to organize work place meetings for us to meet with the workers. If they don&rsquo;t do this, then their &ldquo;support&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really count for very much, but in any case, we can find ways to get into those work places. The purpose of such meetings would be to discuss with those workers the issues they are confronting and how Occupy Oakland can help them. This includes the public sector workers who are facing layoffs and cuts. In many cases the union leadership has accepted these cuts, but we in Occupy Oakland should not.&nbsp;</p>

<a href="../../../content/wisconsins-new-free-speech-restrictions/" rel="bookmark">Wisconsin&#039;s New Free Speech Restrictions</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/20/2011 - 3:27pm</p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/GSDrookEngsm.preview.jpg" alt="" />Since the February uprising in Wisconsin, which began with a three-week occupation of the Capitol in Madison, the building has been home to a variety of demonstrations and political actions.&nbsp; What perhaps stands out the most is the Solidarity Sing-along, which draws upwards of 100 participants and has been going on for more than 40 weeks.&nbsp; The singers gather in the rotunda each weekday at noon to sing songs that include both traditional labor and protest songs and some new songs penned in the months since Governor Scott Walker first introduced his plans to bust the public employee unions and impose devastating austerity measures on the working class of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In recent months police have begun arresting and ticketing people for trivial &quot;violations&quot;, such as wearing hats or sunglasses in the Senate and Assembly galleries, holding signs, or exercising their right (protected by the Wisconsin constitution) to record legislative sessions.&nbsp; These restrictions have apparently been a lead-up to the real crackdown.&nbsp; Just last week, the Walker administration announced a new policy that will severely curtail the free speech rights exercised by the Solidarity Sing-along and other groups who use the Capitol building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules require groups of four or more people to apply for a permit from the DOA at least 72 hours in advance &ldquo;for all activity and displays in state buildings&rdquo;.&nbsp; Groups can be charged $50 per hour per police officer if law enforcement is determined to be necessary.&nbsp; Payment for law enforcement could be required in advance as part of the permit process and protesters could face additional charges for liability insurance.&nbsp; The rules are vague and arbitrary, and so far the administration has refused to clarify them or answer questions from citizens about how they will be enforced, leaving room for abuse by police and DOA officials.</p>
<p>These rules are obviously aimed at making free speech inconvenient and restrictively expensive for most people.&nbsp; Free speech is a hard-won right for Americans.&nbsp; Between 1907 and 1916, free speech demonstrations lead by the IWW swept the western United States.&nbsp; In Spokane, the <em>Industrial Worker</em> published a call to all workers to defend their rights: &quot;Wanted -- Men to Fill the Jails&rdquo;.&nbsp; And fill the jails they did!&nbsp; As one Wobbly got dragged from the soapbox and arrested, another would take his place and the call would go out for more &ldquo;footloose rebels&rdquo; from all over the country to hop on a train and come join the fight.&nbsp; The struggle can be seen as a victory as it eventually led to the founding of the American Civil Liberties Union.&nbsp; The Wisconsin chapter of the ACLU is currently working to help defend the right of Wisconsin citizens to speak freely in the Capitol.</p>
