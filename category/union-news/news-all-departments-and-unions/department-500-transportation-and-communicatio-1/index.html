<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 01/18/2016 - 10:31pm</p>
<p><strong>By Coeur de Bord - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2016/01/17/15-at-ups-by-fw-coeur-de-bord/" target="_blank"><em>The Organizer</em></a>, January 17, 2016</strong></p>
<p>Eleven months ago, the Package Handler&rsquo;s Organizing Committee (PHOC) voted to begin a campaign demanding the starting wage at the three UPS hubs in the Twin Cities be raised to $15/hour (from the current $10), and a corresponding $5/hour raise for all hub employees. &nbsp;We had our sights set on building power towards some form of disruptive action during 2015&rsquo;s Peak Season. &nbsp;Now that Peak has arrived, I would like to share some of my feelings on the progression, evolution, and execution of this campaign, as well as some ways it has influenced our organizing in general at UPS in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I feel this document is useful as part of a future retrospective assessment of the Boxmart campaign and the PHOC committee itself. &nbsp;However, I hope it can also serve as a useful reference for other IWW organizing committees thinking about taking on labor-intensive, medium- to long-term campaigns such as this. &nbsp;Whether or not such a campaign would have a positive impact on your organizing is a decision that only your committee can make, but I hope that by offering my perspectives other Wobblies will be able to make a more informed decision.</p>
<h3><b>The motion </b><b><i>(original language)</i></b><b>:</b></h3>
<p><i>Notes 16/01/15</i></p>
<p><i>What: $5 hourly raise across the board, which would bring starting wage up to $15. Also, end petty wage theft and other shop floor issues where possible.</i></p>
<p><i>When: Major direct action during peak season 2015 aimed at entire Twin Cities operation. &nbsp;Smaller DAs before them, at moments to be determined. Campaign to start within two months (petitions coming out along with Screw ups at MPLS, Eagan, Maple Grove and airport).</i></p>
<p><i>Who: Petition to be drafted by core committee, Mass meeting to be run by &mdash;&mdash;, other tasks delegated to &mdash;, &mdash;- and &mdash; wherever possible to gather support from rest of branch. New shop floor contacts will be expected to further trenchwork on shop floor, canvass for issues to be addressed by escalating Direct Actions, and inoculation. OTC to arrange an OT soon after mass meeting for new contacts. Core committee (eg &mdash;&ndash;) to fill in gaps where people cannot attend a full OT. &nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Where: Meetings at TC IWW office, actions in MPLS, Eagan, Maple Grove and airport. &nbsp;Actions to focus on Minnesota operation unless tempting opportunities arise.</i></p>
<p><i>How:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i> Use petition to gather contacts for mass meeting. Create Facebook, etc contact points.</i></li>
<li><i> Use mass meeting to identify people willing and able to be organizers (and other roles) and set broad outlines of effort, changing as necessary to reflect workers&rsquo; concerns.</i></li>
<li><i> Follow up with potential organizers, get to OT where possible and patch with one-on-</i><i>ones where not. Create a campaign committee to broaden work, bring in smaller escalatable issues (eg petty wage theft, harassment etc), grow committee itself.</i></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><i> Do direct actions on smaller issues, symbolic stuff where appropriate. Include off-shop-floor issues eg prison slave labour ala hands up don&rsquo;t ship.</i></li>
<li><i> Follow up on retaliation for the above.</i></li>
<li><i> Bring smaller issues back in, build excitement and commitment and hold mass meetings in the months leading up to peak to organize peak action.</i></li>
<li><i> Mess everything up during peak.</i></li>
<li><i> Publicize concessions and workers&rsquo; eye view analysis of fight, follow up on retaliations.</i></li>
<li><i> Set further goals.</i></li>

<p><b>By Phineas Gage - <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2016/01/07/free-parking/"><em>Recomposition</em></a>, January 7, 2016</b></p>
<p><img width="320" height="222" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/freeParking_Photo3.jpg" alt="" />Ike and I walked into Sam&rsquo;s office at exactly ten in the morning. Not a minute before or after. We never talked to management, especially the Labour Relations guys, with less than a pair present. Sam ran the video on his computer screen for us to look at. It was a clip of a woman walking at night towards a door. She looks over her shoulder and a shadow glides towards her, she lunges for the door and struggles to open it with the key card. Then a leg that ends with a bicycle pedal and two wheels drifts into plain view and off camera. She opens the glass door and then slams the door behind her and leans on it, panting. The clip then looped and played over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, in the investigation, you told the sister that you think the union put her up to this?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>I was starting to feel a keen rage swelling up inside of me but I grabbed the arms of the chair tightly and tried to keep my cool.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s face was like cold stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too convenient. You guys start complaining about the health and safety at the Transportation yard and all of a sudden someone almost gets &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; in the yard?&rdquo; He was doing the scare quotes with his fingers.</p>
<p>The video clip completed another loop.</p>
<p>I could feel my anger at the situation starting to effect my judgement. He was probably egging me on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is staged Sam. I mean, really, all things being equal, what is more likely: a confrontation with someone at night outside a downtown workstation or an elaborate conspiracy to put a show on for the cameras?&rdquo; I was smiling and trying to insert some humour into the situation.</p>
<p>The clip completed another loop.</p>
<p>I could feel a light stinging sensation on the back of my thighs as soon as Sam started to talk again. The hairs on my arms were starting to stand on end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at? This isn&rsquo;t funny. See, this is his problem, Ike, he doesn&rsquo;t take this stuff seriously.&rdquo; Sam was dripping with condescension. That and cologne.</p>
<p>I shot out of my chair, like a bullet, and leaned over his desk stuffing my index finger into the space in front of his chest. I could see Ike&rsquo;s eyes go wide as my one arm stretched out towards him, my index finger stopping just shy of his chest. &lsquo;Never, ever, touch them, Phineas, especially when angry&rsquo;, I told myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking lucky all I&rsquo;m doing is laughing, you dickhead. A woman almost got assaulted in your parking lot and your first response is to spin an insane conspiracy theory about performance art in front of surveillance cameras? What kind of piece of shit sociopath does that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I regained composure and looked at Ike.</p>
<p>Ike nodded and said, &ldquo;I think that is about as of thorough an exploration of the issues we are going to get today,&rdquo; He gently grabbed my arm and we walked out.</p>

<strong>Featured Story 15 - NC and VA Drivers Laid Off, IWW Responds<br />
</strong>
<br />
<img src="../../../../graphics/IU530/General%20Images/Trucker1engsm.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
In a move seen often by workers attempting to improve workplace conditions, trucking bosses fired 15 drivers in North Carolina and Virginia early in January this year. The companies claim it was for decreased business volumes, but most of the drivers were among internal organizers for the IWW. In addition, the companies began hiring new drivers immediately following the lay offs. &quot;We have no doubt this was in retaliation for our organizing efforts,&quot; one driver said at a meeting held January 17.<br />
<br />
The IWW conducted a scheduled meeting, January 17, which was originally planned to formally establish the union was altered to determine how to proceed with the organizing effort given the firings. Undeterred by the bossâ€™s aggression, many drivers (including many of those laid off) still joined the union. A petition for charter is still being circulated.<br />
<br />
In an outpouring of altruism, IWW members across the globe responded to the layoffs by donating money to the struggling drivers.Â  IWW members in Cambridge, England and Cologne, Germany held fundraisers to help the drivers in NC and VA. This act indicates that Wobblies everywhere believe in this movement. The money has been an incredible help to the drivers and the campaign in general. The campaign continues in the Southeast.<br />

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 02/10/2009 - 7:22pm</p>

Organizing is heating up for the
truckers in the southeastern United States. Though the independent drivers of
North Carolina and Virginia have come a long way this past year, there are still
aspects of the campaign that need attention. Right now there are a handful of
wobblies helping out, including two part time organizers/volunteer coordinators.
For efficiencies sake, we've divided up the current campaign needs into three
different teams, Organizing, Logistics, and Strategy. Many of the tasks can be
completed outside of the North Carolina area or even the United States. If you
can help we ask that you can devote a steady amount of time or a regular task,
whether big or small. We'll have organizers that will work with you. Possible
internships available.Â  For more info about the campaign visit our website at<strong>
