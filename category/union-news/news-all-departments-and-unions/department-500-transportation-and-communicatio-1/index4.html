To truckers and media:
</p>
<p>
Our members and organizers in the trucking industry have been hearing about the called for April 1, 2008 trucker shut down.
</p>
<p>
The IWW is not organizing or calling for this shutdown, but supports all truckers taking action to improve their lives and protest the skyrocketing fuel, low pay, unpaid waits and all the other conditions that grow worse by the day.
</p>
<p>
Truckers unite! Only through organizing a union across the transportation industry can we begin to change this.
</p>
<p>
The IWW is committed to building a democratic, fighting union in the trucking industry whether you are an independent contractor driver or company driver, intermodal, LTL or over-the-road. Please contact us if you and your co-workers need support or are interested in making trucking a job worth keeping.

<br />
300 troquer@s based in South Gate and Mira Loma went on strike against HUDD et al.
<br />
These workers were mostly young latino migrants with a very visible
participation of women truck drivers. Most of them had been in the
harbor about 5 years with maybe as few as 10% going back to the CWA
days of 1996 and only a handful that were present during the 1980s.

That&rsquo;s enough fuel for about a day and a half of driving. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making near the money I was,&rdquo; said the truck driver as he passed through Hesperia on Wednesday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Like many truck drivers, Powell owns his own truck and pays for his own fuel. <br /> <br /> Fuel prices are just one of many concerns facing independent owner-operators at the close of this year. <br /> <br />Another is the new identification card required to pick up and drop off cargo at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles &mdash; the Transportation Workers Identification Credential &mdash; which officials plan to roll out as early as December. <br /> <br />Economist John Husing, a consultant to the ports, said the TWIC card might exclude between 15 and 22 percent of truck drivers &mdash; for either a criminal record or immigration violations, according to a survey recently conducted. <br /> <br />On top of that, the ports are considering new environmental regulations that would ban all trucks manufactured before 1989 at the ports, according to several sources. <br /> <br /> The ports are in meetings to determine what kind of subsidy, if any, might be offered to truckers so they can buy new trucks. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;Nobody knows because the program&rsquo;s not finalized,&rdquo; Husing said. &ldquo;There are major issues that have not been decided yet: Will the drivers be allowed to continue working as independent operators or will the drivers as part of the clean truck program be required to sell their trucks or become employees?&rdquo; <br /> <br />Port truckers are some of the lowest paid in the industry, Husing said. Many truckers live throughout Southern California, including the High Desert. <br /> <br /> And while the problems are many, the solutions are certainly not unified. <br /> <br />One union, the Industrial Workers of the World, is calling for a truckers shutdown on Monday from Dallas to Los Angeles to commemorate the death of Joe Hill, a union organizer who was hanged in Utah in 1915. <br /> <br />&ldquo;There&rsquo;s all these meetings going on behind closed doors, and everybody&rsquo;s interests are being represented at these meetings, and there&rsquo;s nobody there representing them except us,&rdquo; said Jay Brophy, a representative of IWW. <br /> <br />The Teamsters Union supports making all drivers employees of the freight companies once again, Husing said, as they once were. Brophy, of the IWW, agrees. <br /> <br />&ldquo;They have to pay for the fuel, they have to pay for the maintenance, the company doesn&rsquo;t pay for their unemployment, worker&rsquo;s comp, income tax, all of this is left on them.&rdquo; <br /> <br />Stuart Hoynak, another trucker stopping off in Hesperia, does not mind being independent, nor does he mind being fingerprinted for a TWIC card. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;That I understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We got to be safe. They should document everybody. I feel it&rsquo;s a security measure.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> What he does mind are the fuel costs. <br /> <br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for everybody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s a major cut in pay. We don&rsquo;t get paid for sitting unless the wheels are turning. And every fuel hike is hundreds of dollars out of our paycheck, not a couple of pennies. So right now with the price of fuel, we&rsquo;re losing anywhere from 1,000 dollars-plus every week. ... When the fuel goes up sometimes an average of 5 cents every two days. There is no reason. There is no reason. It&rsquo;s crazy. Everybody&rsquo;s making a lot of money.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Art Wong, spokesman for the Port of Long Beach, said he was not aware of a shutdown being planned. <br /> <br /> But he acknowledged that big changes are ahead, both with the clean trucks initiative and the TWIC card. <br /> <br />&ldquo;It will be a big change no matter what we do. Even if we leave it alone, everybody&rsquo;s going to have to get new trucks, and even if we offer grants, I don&rsquo;t know if these guys are going to be able to afford new trucks.&rdquo; <br /> <br /> About 40 percent of all goods entering the United States come through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. <br /> <br /> Any strike related to the ports can cost millions in lost time. <br /> <br />In 2002, a dispute between longshoremen and terminal operators resulted in the loss of about $1 million a day for the Los Angeles/Long Beach ports, according to trade magazine Land Line. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_223 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/los-angeles-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Los Angeles General Membership Branch.

<a href="../../../../node/3395/" rel="bookmark">Los Angeles Port Truckers Mobilizing for May Day Shutdown</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 05/02/2007 - 3:49pm</p>
<p><img width="252" height="189" border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU530/LATaxis/lat1.jpg" />By Gideon Dev.</p><p>Truckers in the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach are mobilizing to repeat their performance of a year ago, when over 90% of the trucks were off the road. The shutdown last year was a show of solidarity with the immigrant rights movement and expression of shop floor anger over work conditions. It gave immediate creditability to the protests and boycott in Los Angeles and throughout the nation.<br /><br />However, despite success in preventing the reactionary HR4437 from becoming law, the immigrant rights movement has left much wanting. After a rising tide of historic marches whose crest was May Day 2006, the single largest day of protest in US history, there has been a visible dearth of organization to press the concerns of immigrant workers. What momentum there was in spring was lost in summer, as the corporate elite and their partners in government responded with the passage of S2611 by the Democratic Party, as well as the bipartisan &lsquo;Secure Fence Act of 2006&rsquo;. Highly publicized ICE raids continue to be made&mdash;with the expressed purpose of trying to pressure the Congress to approve bracero guest worker programs! Conditions did not change with the marches, but have been getting worse since.<br /><br />The Los Angeles General Membership Branch (LA GMB) of the IWW has called for a complete shutdown of port trucking as well as solidarity from all related industries this May 1st, 2007. As of the time of this writing, the response and feedback from troqueros has been positive. Nearly all truckers have been encouraged by the news of solidarity from the ILWU locals in San Francisco and Seattle, who resolved to not work on May Day. We in the LA GMB were particularly heartened that their resolutions highlighted both our own involvement in last year&rsquo;s May Day shutdown, and the current efforts of the March 25th Coalition, of which we are members. It was at the latter&rsquo;s National Conference for Immigrant Rights that the call was made for a second &lsquo;Great American Boycott&rsquo; on May Day, and that the LA GMB committed itself to putting the question of a May Day shutdown to the port truckers directly. However, it has become clear that the impetus for action by the troqueros this year will not solely be supporting the immigrant rights movement, or even reclaiming May Day as the workers&rsquo; day, but the condition of being exploited workers who drive international trade.<br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_223 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/los-angeles-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Los Angeles General Membership Branch.
