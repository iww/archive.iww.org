</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 10/24/2015 - 9:48pm</p>
<p><b>By the Admin Staff - <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/10/08/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-ii/">Recomposition</a>, October 8, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s. </em></p>
<p><i><i><img width="320" height="321" align="right" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/SSWU1.jpg" />This is the second&nbsp;part of a <a href="http://recomposition.info/2015/08/27/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-i/">series of concrete examples</a> and very brief summaries of organizations that have some component of direct action and a form of collective bargaining that operate outside the&nbsp;<span class="il">labour</span> <span class="il">relations</span> framework. </i>The&nbsp;following are&nbsp;IWW projects that had aspects of Labour Relations Board campaigns to them but were essentially not oriented towards the LRB. You will also notice that these examples are American. One key difference in the American context is the presence of a longer and richer history of what is called &ldquo;minority unionism&rdquo; that is unions that seek to build majorities from minorities but are capable of acting as a part of the workforce that doesn&rsquo;t always represent a majority pro-union group as verified by card check or a board election.</i></p>
<h3><b>2. Corridor Campaigns:&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><b>a). Montpelier Downtown Workers Union</b><br />
Corridor campaigns were a popular model for IWW branches to experiment with in the early to mid 2000&rsquo;s.&nbsp;This campaign started as a corridor campaign under the United Electrical Workers Union. An independent union with a history of Communist leadership. They were based on having small committees in small shops spread out over a geographic area with a similar constellation of businesses, usually retail corridors.</p>
<p>This campaign started under the sponsorship of a workers centre run by the UE and ran for a few years. One of the more innovative elements of this campaign was the grievance committee combined with stewards that were assigned to a geographic area. Non members were told of the presence of a stewards in their area and if they had problems to go the member of the MDWU who would help them resolve problems. They also had a grievance committee that would pool resources to tackle bigger tougher problems.</p>
<p>Eventually the UE tried to push it to sign more contracts, as the campaign was failing they signed on with the IWW but it continued it&rsquo;s decline and folded.</p>
<p>Advantages: Multiple committees in multiple shops. Geographic stewards, grievance committee. Had a clear way to address smaller concerns that didn&rsquo;t warrant mass industrial action but weren&rsquo;t simply individual gripes either.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Pressure from business union sponsor to go for contracts. Small shops prone to high turnover, going public in small shops allows the boss to charm neutrals and organise anti union elements easily.</p>
<p><b>b). South Street Workers Union</b><br />
South Street was a campaign in a retail corridor in Philadelphia started by the IWW branch there. It had multiple committees in multiple small shops. They agitated around workplace issues as well as workers issues off the job including a campaign around transit fares. The campaign lasted a number of years and built up the branch but eventually folded.</p>
<p>Advantages: Maintained a function organisation between small multiple shops over a few years. Agitated around issues in the community and mobilised the community around non workplace demands as well as making some small gains in shops.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: High turnover wore the campaign down.</p>
<h3><b>3. The IWW and Bike Couriers:</b></h3>
<p>There is very little documentation that is easy to track down and I have a few articles I intend to put online but the Bike Courier campaigns of the early 2000s had a tremendous influence on the development of Direct Unionism or Solidarity Unionism. The key organisers in these campaigns had a huge impact on the IWW and played a central role in the transition from being mostly a radical labour history club to a small fighting union with a different program from the rest of the labour movement. The longest running and most high profile campaign was in Chicago where the IWW maintained a presence in the courier industry for ten years. They had committees spanning multiple shops and won grievances against employers as well as mounting campaigns against building management companies to make their buildings more accessible to the couriers that served their tenants.</p>
<p>There were also bike courier committees in Portland, New York, Boston and San Francisco to name a few others.</p>
<p>Advantages: Extremely flexible organisations, took on issues on and off the job. Well developed conception of non contractual unionism. Multiple campaigns in multiple shops in Chicago. Also very structured and formal in Portland and Chicago, clear meeting agendas, rules of order and elected officers.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Never broke out of the bike courier sub culture in a meaningful way. Very oriented towards a largely young and urban counter culture workforce.</p>

<p>The bombing on 10th of October 2015 was directly against the Kurdish liberation movement, the working class and all oppositions who resist against the dictatorship.</p>
<p>This massacre is another ring of the chain that extends from Armenian genocide to Dersim massacre, from May Day&rsquo;77 to Maraş Massacre&rsquo;78, from Şırnak Massacre&rsquo;92 to Diyarbakır and Suru&ccedil; bombings that happened within this year. All these massacres have targeted the people who ask for Freedom, Democracy and Justice on Anatolia over the last 100 years. The offender side has always been fascist party militants, religious fundamentalists and occasionally governmental commissioners themselves.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../../../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 5:11pm</p>
<p><strong>By Some Angry Workers - <a href="https://angryworkersworld.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/open-letter-to-iww-members/" target="_blank">Angry Workers of the World</a>, October 11, 2015</strong></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s. We have republished this open letter to our union in order to stimulate discussion:<br />
</em></p>
<p><img width="320" height="226" align="right" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/tumblr_inline_n9nbxtzcgl1rby4la.jpg" alt="" />Autumnal greetings comrades!</p>
<p>We have known some of you for a while, and met some more of you recently on our film screening &lsquo;tour&rsquo; earlier this year. It was great to make some new friends and have some good discussions about what we&rsquo;re all up to. We thought we&rsquo;d get in touch with you about some proposals for joint work in the coming year, let us know if you&rsquo;re interested!</p>
<p><b>1. We want to start an Amazon workers newsletter</b></p>
<p>We have lots of translated material of interviews with Amazon workers in Germany, Poland and India, as well as knowing comrades who work in, and have direct contact with, Amazon workers. We could turn this into an (irregular) 2-sided newsletter for Amazon workers in the UK. Polish comrades have set up a small section of the Workers Initiative (IP) syndicalist union inside the warehouse in Poznan, which is now the site of Europe&rsquo;s biggest Amazon warehouse. It was built to undermine workers at struggling Amazon warehouses across Germany. Workers from Germany and Poland recently had a meeting together to discuss coordinating their efforts:</p>
<p><a href="https://libcom.org/news/cross-border-amazon-workers-meeting-30092015#" target="_blank">http://libcom.org/news/cross-border-amazon-workers-meeting-30092015#</a></p>
<p>And at the the recent meeting about transnational strikes in Poznan earlier this month we heard about the idea of Amazon workers organising a bus caravan through Europe.</p>
<p>As of yet, we have no contact with Amazon workers/militants in England who could participate in international meetings or coordinations like these ones. We think this newsletter would be a good step towards this. It would also let workers know what is happening at other Amazon warehouses, which may encourage their own activity e.g. other workers&rsquo; experiences of union struggles such as those being led by the <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">ver.di union in Germany; how workers there don&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;countdown&rsquo; on their scanner/watch, which has relieved some of their work pressure; or the overtime slow-down strike in Poznan in support of the workers on strike in Germany (they had been ordered by management to work overtime as they supply for the German market, so essentially the workers in Poland were refusing to be scabs).</span></p>
<p>Would any of you be interested in working on this together? Essentially this would mean co-writing and/or distributing the paper outside Amazon warehouses when shifts start and/or finish. Because we are based in London, we are not immediately near any Amazon warehouses but could also come from time to time to help out. You could build on these links in whatever ways you had the capacity for within your local. At the moment it just seems a shame that we have all these materials and contacts that would make a great newsletter and they&rsquo;re not being put to use!</p>
<p>We made a list of Amazon warehouse locations below [1] so if your local has the time, capacity, energy and will to focus on these workers, or at least start something and then see how things go, get in touch and we can discuss in more detail.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried that your local not having the longer-term resources to support workers if the newsletter does prove to be a catalyst for workers wanting to organise, then let&rsquo;s discuss how this could be overcome.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/30/2015 - 9:04pm</p>
<p><b>By </b><b>Immanuel Ness - <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/21/us-labor-law-at-80-the-enduring-relevance-of-class-struggle-unionism/" target="_blank"><em>CounterPunch</em></a>, September 22, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../sites/default/files/images/clock.jpg" />By embracing collective bargaining through the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, or Wagner Act, organized labor deprived workers of their capacity to contest private and state power. This compromise closed out any possibility of building a mass-based labor movement for decades. Rather than advancing the interests of workers, the NLRA circumscribed workers&rsquo; aspirations for democratic syndicalist and autonomist unions.</p>
<h3><strong>IWW: Alternative to Contract Unionism</strong></h3>
<p>In examining the long-term failure of organized labor, we must first note the alternative, organic, autonomous workers&rsquo; movement embodied in particular by unions affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. From its inception in 1905 until the 1920&rsquo;s, the IWW represented a significant alternative to contract unionism. The IWW stood for the solidarity of <em>all</em> workers and it was fiercely opposed for that reason &mdash; by capital, by reformists such as Daniel DeLeon of the Socialist Labor Party and by the American Federation of Labor (AFL).<a name="_ednref1"><sup><sup>[i]</sup></sup></a> The IWW engaged in a genuine form of democracy and a mass industrial organizing model ultimately adopted by the AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO), which both utilized for very different purposes.<a name="_ednref2"><sup><sup>[ii]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>The IWW employed sabotage, direct action and strikes through the equivalent of workers&rsquo; councils in both the community and at the point of production, while disavowing the legitimacy of the state and recognizing that any agreement with business must be temporary. The Wobblies vigorously negotiated with employers but were never deluded that agreements would bring labor peace.</p>
<p>That the solidarity of all workers was not just talk for the IWW is evidenced by their organization of Blacks, immigrant workers from Mexico and Southeast Asia, and women in, for example, the Bread and Roses Strike. Historian Peter Cole has richly demonstrated that the IWW embraced multiracial unionism, perhaps most notably in Philadelphia&rsquo;s Maritime Workers Local 8, where Black workers maintained a majority.iii</p>
<p>The IWW achieved major gains for U.S. workers into the 1930s while (and because) it emphasized solidarity and workers&rsquo; control. When AFL and CIO unions expanded dramatically as a result of upheaval that began in the early 1930&rsquo;s, they, by contrast, mostly failed to stimulate enthusiasm among workers. Riding the massive wave of sit-down strikes to positions of power, leaders of insurgent unions contributed greatly to sublimating the continuation of such militancy by throwing their support behind modest and incomplete New Deal reforms that ultimately <em>weakened</em> the capacity of workers to confront capital directly. In the area of labor relations, the NLRA was the fulcrum.</p>
<p>Many workers who participated in the sit-down strikes in mass production industries considered unionization synonymous with control over the enterprise, as was recognized immediately by capital. Given the breadth and ongoing militancy of the labor upheaval, the most astute corporate leaders soon expressed willingness to yield select rights provided that employer absolutism in the workplace was maintained. The NLRA proved to be the mechanism for doing so and responsible labor leaders proved willing junior partners in quelling worker militancy. For approximately a year after the wave of sit-down strikes, many workers were surprised to learn that their unions, as sanctioned by the NLRA, set up a framework that restricted their autonomy.</p>
<p>In his account of the Flint sit-down strikes, Sidney Fine wrote of how UAW members &ldquo;were reluctant to accept the customary discipline exercised by management&rdquo; and &ldquo;ran wild in many plants for months.&rdquo; Union committeemen aggressively pressed the grievances of union members upon oftentimes unyielding foremen, and as a UAW member later conceded, &ldquo;Every time a dispute came up the fellows would have a tendency to sit down and just stop working.&rdquo;<sup>iv</sup></p>
