</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 05/25/2017 - 7:05pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Portland IWW - <a href="http://portlandiww.org/2017/05/portland-may-day-2017-official-response/" target="_blank">Portland IWW</a>, May 4, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../sites/default/files/images/xPortland-LOGO.png.pagespeed.ic.eyvHj59-oJ/" align="right" alt="" />This was originally sent to KOIN 6 as a response to the events that took place on May Day in Portland.</em></p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World is proud that we were able to celebrate International Workers Day and march in solidarity with so many organizations which are essential and vibrant to the community of Portland and at large. International Workers Day is an important holiday that showcases the struggle of all workers against the wholesale societal systemic oppression brought about by corporations, CEOs, and the mega-rich capitalist class. The fact that there was such a strong contingent of marchers from all walks of life is representative of the American working class.</p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s use of violence against workers and their families &ndash; as well as the children who were in the crowd celebrating the holiday with their parents &ndash; is a travesty and a violation of both human rights, as well as the right to peaceful assembly. We condemn their efforts in restricting accessibility to fellow workers with disabilities, and their blatant disregard for the health and well-being of the people they have sworn to protect. By direct contrast, they assisted visible white supremacists and white nationalists at the &ldquo;March for Free Speech 82nd Ave,&rdquo; specifically a non-permitted march by pro-Trump supporters on April 29th by chartering Tri-Met buses and public transportation to get these people, some of whom were making Nazi salutes during their protest, back to their vehicles.</p>
<p>Our goal is and has always been to support and assist the workers of the world, and we will continue to fight for the needs of all in the face of police and capitalist oppression, and stand by our watchword that an injury to one is an injury to all. As such, the Portland Police Bureau inflicted shameful injury against the workers, their families, and their children during the May Day march; we will stand against that in solidarity with our fellow workers.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/28/2017 - 11:14pm</p>
<p><strong>By anonymous - <a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/sign-statement-solidarity-j20-defendants/"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, April 26, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../sites/default/files/images/j20.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="220" alt="" />The following statement was drafted by supporters of those arrested at Inauguration protests in DC on January 20th, with the intent of providing a public platform for organizations around North America to express their collective opposition to these charges. The list of signees will be posted and continually updated at defendJ20resistance.org and several other sites. To have your group or crew sign on, send an email to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:J20endorsements@protonmail.com" rel="nofollow">J20endorsements@protonmail.com</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Statement of Solidarity with #DisruptJ20 Defendants</h2>
<p>On January 20, 2017, tens of thousands of people converged in Washington, D.C. for the #disruptJ20 protests to oppose the inauguration of Donald Trump. A combination of blockades, marches, and festive demonstrations shattered the spectacle of a peaceful transition of power, and made it clear around the world that people do not recognize Trump&rsquo;s authority. What could have been a day signaling resignation and defeat became a moment of defiance and resistance. As such, the protests on J20 set a tone and precedent for the events that unfolded shortly after, including the notably successful, mass direct actions at airports against Trump&rsquo;s Muslim ban, as well as ongoing resistance to deportations. While Trump and his alt-right foot soldiers have encountered few meaningful obstacles from liberal politicians in the halls of power, grassroots resistance has continued to prove a substantial force.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, with resistance comes repression. In addition to shooting pepper spray and concussion grenades indiscriminately at protesters, including children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, DC police cordoned off an entire block and mass arrested more than 230 people in an attempt to stop an anti-capitalist and anti-fascist march. While mass arrests are not unheard of, in this case arrestees are each being charged with felony riot, a charge that potentially carries <em>ten years in prison</em>.</p>
<p>With these heightened charges the state is trying to set a precedent for harsh crackdowns of disruptive protest in the future, so that Trump can proceed with his agenda unimpeded by anything but symbolic hand-wringing. This strategy corresponds with a broader wave of repression and reaction, from the arrests and grand jury investigations of Indigenous water protectors at #StandingRock to backlash against #BlackLivesMatter and black-led uprisings against police. The arrests at J20 also inform local strategies for repression, including anti-protest laws that have been proposed in 18 different state legislatures, which further criminalize commonly used tactics like highway takeovers and in some cases make it legal for drivers to knowingly hit protesters marching in roadways.</p>
<p>The charges against J20 defendants are an experiment. If the courts are able to successfully prosecute those arrested at J20, this will send a green light to the forces of repression seeking to contain, control, and eliminate social movements around the country. Just as all of our struggles are connected, we understand these arrests to represent a real threat to all efforts towards true freedom, dignity, and autonomy. We call for the immediate dropping of all charges, and express our sincere solidarity with and support for those arrested, and encourage others to do so as well.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/28/2017 - 11:08pm</p>
<p><strong>By Climate Workers and Movement Generation Justice &amp; Ecology Project - <a href="http://www.climateworkers.org/?p=214" target="_blank">Originally posted on Climate Workers</a>, April 28, 2017; crossposted from <a href="https://ecology.iww.org/node/2218" target="_blank">ecology.iww.org</a>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><b><img src="http://ecology.iww.org/images/PCMMayDay.gif" alt="" align="right" />An Open Letter from Environmental &amp; Climate Justice Organizations on May Day</b></p>
<p>Worker power, immigrant rights, and racial justice must be at the heart of environmental and climate movements</p>
<p>As environmental and climate justice organizations, we declare our support for protests planned for International Workers Day (&ldquo;May Day&rdquo;), May 1st, 2017 and for workers who choose to participate by honoring the general strike.</p>
<p>International Workers&rsquo; Day was first established to commemorate the deaths of workers fighting for the 8-hour work day in Chicago in 1886. It has long been a day to uplift the struggles, honor the sacrifices, and celebrate the triumphs of working people across the world. The day has taken special significance in the U.S. since May 1st, 2006 when 1.5 million immigrants and their allies took to the streets to protest racist immigration policies.</p>
<p>Today, workers face unprecedented attacks on wages, benefits, workplace safety, and the right to organize free from fear and retaliation. But we know that we are all stronger when workers in our communities have safe, fair, and dignified employment with which they can support their families without fear of deportation or violence.</p>
<p>The effects of our fossil fuel economy fall first and worst on working class communities, communities of color, immigrants, and indigenous peoples who have not only contributed the least to climate disruption, but have the least resources to shoulder the burden of a transition to a new, climate-friendly economy. It is these frontline communities who are also at the forefront of change and whose solutions and leadership we most need.</p>
<p>As organizations working to transition our economy away from profit-seeking resource extraction toward ecological resilience and economic democracy, we know that worker power has to be at the heart of that transition.</p>
<p>We urgently need the wisdom and skills of millions of workers to transform our food, water, waste, transit, and energy systems in order to live within the finite resources of this planet that we call home. But the Trump agenda only promises jobs building more prison cells, border walls, bombs, and oil pipelines. Workers deserve not only fair wages, but work that makes our ecosystems and communities more resilient, not destroys them.</p>
<p>Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. No significant social change in this country has come without tremendous risk and sacrifice by ordinary people &ndash; from workers who walk off the job to water protectors facing down water cannons and attack dogs.</p>
<p>As environmental and climate justice organizations, we support workers who choose to walk off their jobs on May 1st because we know that the fight to protect land, water, air and soil is inseparable from the fight to protect the life and dignity of workers, migrants, and communities of color.</p>
<p>To workers participating in protests on May 1st, we say: &ldquo;Thank you. You deserve better. And we&rsquo;ve got your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that end, we join with unions and worker-led organizations throughout the country in asking that there be <b>NO RETALIATION</b> against any worker &ndash; union or non union &ndash; who exercises their rights by taking time off from work on May 1. Further, should workers face retaliation, we pledge our strong support for efforts to defend those workers.</p>
