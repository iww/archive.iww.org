There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth. We find that the centring of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever-growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers. </p></blockquote> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_395 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/vancouver-gmb/" rel="tag" title="">Vancouver GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_9 last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="All workers in forests.

This romantic image, though based partly on fact, glosses over dark and frightful features of the lumberjack's life that in 1917 prompted Minnesota's sons of Paul Bunyan to down their saws and axes and walk out of their camps. Led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a radical labor group advocating industrial unions and the overthrow of capitalism through strikes, sabotage, and eventual revolution, the jacks' strike for a time paralyzed the lumber industry of northern Minnesota. The resolution of that strike helped redefine the boundcanes of permissible political and economic dissent in Minnesota, virtually erased the specter of strong IWW influence on the iron range, and served as a precedent for the state's treatment of dissenters during World War I. 1</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_9 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="All workers in forests.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 08/07/2005 - 12:57am</p>
<p><u>Disclaimer</u><em> - The following article is reposted here because it is an issue with some relevance to the IWW.&nbsp; The views of the author and the publisher do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.</em></p> <p>By Jeff Shantz (Toronto-NEFAC)</p><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><img border="0" align="right" src="../../../../../graphics/IU120/headwaters/headwaters2.jpg" /> In recent years a variety of social movement and environmental commentators have devoted a great deal of energy to efforts which argue the demise of class struggle as a viable force for social change (See Eckersley, 1990; Bowles and Gintis, 1987; Bookchin, 1993; 1997). These writers argue that analyses of class struggle are unable to account for the plurality of expressions which hierarchy, domination and oppression take in advanced capitalist or what they prefer to call &quot;postindustrial&quot; societies (See Bookchin, 1980; 1986). They charge that class analyses render a one-dimensional portrayal of social relations. The result of this has been a broad practical and theoretical turn away from questions of class and especially class struggle.</p> <p>In my view, both orthodox Marxist constructions of class struggle and the arguments raised against that conceptualization have been constrained by conceptually narrow visions of class struggle. Commentators have either taken class to mean an undifferentiated monolith (Bookchin, 1986; 1987) which acts, or more often fails to act, as the instrumental agent in history or else as a fiction generated to obscure hopelessly divided and antagonistic relations within the working class (Laclau and Mouffe, 1985; Bourdieu, 1987). What is generally missing from these otherwise disparate accounts is a dynamic understanding of people as workers and workers as activists.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_9 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="All workers in forests.
