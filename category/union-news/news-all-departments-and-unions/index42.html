</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/14/2009 - 7:59pm</p>
<div>
<img src="../../../graphics/labor/globsolired.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
The following motion was passed at the San Francisco Bay Area GMB January meeting, Thursday, Janury 8, 2009 with few dissenting votes:
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;WHEREAS the Apartheid State of Israel has conducted a siege of Gaza
for many months; and
</div>
<br />
<div>
WHEREAS this siege, itself, is an act of war as well as an act of collective punishment; and
</div>
<br />
<div>
WHEREAS  this siege is simply a further extension of the apartheid policies of the State of Israel, including calls within Israel for
ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Israel, stealing of land and water
rights from Palestinians both within Israel as well as in the West Bank, and
the
</div>
<div>
building of the Apartheid Wall, as well as other measures; and
</div>
<br />
<div>
WHEREAS the Industrial Workers of the World stands for working class unity, which is impossible as long as any sector of the working class
is oppressed in the way that the Palestinian people are by the State of Israel; now be it
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that the San Francisco chapter of the IWW unreservedly condemns the Israeli attack on the people of Gaza; and be it
further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we also oppose all terrorist acts aimed at civilians, whether they be Palestinian, Jew or anybody else, and in this
particular case we recognize that the rocket attacks on Israel being carried out
by Hamas can only serve as a cover for official Israeli racism and expansionism, even though we recognize that the State of Israel bears primary responsibility for the situation; and be it further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we call for complete Israeli withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders, including dismantling of the settlements and the Apartheid
Wall, the right to return of the Palestinians driven into refugee status,
and for equal rights for all within the State of Israel; and be it
further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we recognize that the Histadrut leadership, in their
support for the Israeli bosses and the bosses' politicians as well as their support for the apartheid policies of the State of Israel, have
placed themselves squarely in the camp of the class opponents of the working class; and be it further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we oppose the state imposition of or support for any religion; and be it finally
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we will support any steps to oppose division within the working class as well as racism and all forms of special oppression in
our struggle for workers' rights and workers' power internationally.&quot;

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 01/06/2009 - 10:50am</p>
It’s that time of year again…<BR /><BR />
MLK Day March Against Wage Slavery!<BR /><BR />
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a tireless fighter for social justice. Every year, the IWW marches on MLK Day to honor his legacy.<BR /><BR />
We march on the workplaces in which we are organizing to show solidarity with our fellow workers and send a clear message to the bosses that we stand united against all forms of slavery!<BR /><BR />
We are calling on Starbucks to pay the holiday premium on MLK Day. <BR /><BR />
We are calling on Wild Edibles owner Richard Martin to stop union-busting, rehire fired workers, and settle his ongoing labor dispute with the workers.<BR /><BR />

On the morning of Wed. (17 December 2008), the offices of the G.S.E.E. (at
the intersection of Patision St. and Alexandras St.) were occupied by insurgent
workers and the building was declared a liberated workers' zone. Their
declaration speaks of their wish &quot;[t]o disperse the media-touted myth that the
workers were and are absent from the clashes, and that the rage of these days
was an affair of some 500 &quot;mask-bearers,&quot; &quot;hooligans&quot; or some other such fairy
tale, while on the T.V. screens the workers were presented as victims of the
clash, while the capitalist crisis in Greece and worldwide continues to lead to
countless layoffs that the media and their managers portray as a &quot;natural
phenomenon&quot;.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
<strong>Communique #1 (17 December 2008):</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div>
We will either determine our history ourselves or let it be determined
without us.
</div>
<br />
<div>
We, manual workers, employees, jobless, temporary workers, local or
migrants, are not passive T.V. viewers. Since the murder of Alexandros
Grigoropoulos on Saturday night, we participate in the demonstrations, the
clashes with the police, the occupations of the centre or the neighborhoods.
Time and time again we had to leave our jobs and our daily obligations to take
the streets with the students, the university students and the other
proletarians in the struggle.
</div>
<br />
<div>
WE DECIDED TO OCCUPY THE BUILDING OF G.S.E.E.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- To turn it into a space of free expression and a meeting point of
workers.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- To disperse the media-touted myth that the workers were and are absent
from the clashes, and that the rage of these days was an affair of some 500
&quot;mask-bearers,&quot; &quot;hooligans&quot; or some other fairy tale, while on the T.V. screens
the workers were presented as victims of the clash, while the capitalist crisis
in Greece and worldwide continues to lead to countless layoffs that the media
and their managers deal as a &quot;natural phenomenon&quot;.
