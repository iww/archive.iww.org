</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 05/21/2006 - 12:42pm</p>
Hundreds of thousands of workers yesterday (Thursday 18th) supported trade union giant Cosatu&rsquo;s one-day general strike in protest against job losses. Huge marches brought the central business districts of Johannesburg and Durban to a standstill as police sealed roads and businesses closed shop. The strike also crippled some gold mines and shut numerous schools, but other sectors of the economy were largely unaffected.<br /> <br /> Authorities in Cape Town banned a march planned as part of the stoppage after striking security workers rampaged through the city smashing shops and cars two days earlier. At the time of going to press there were no reports of violence during yesterday&rsquo;s marches. But two Golden Arrow buses were torched before dawn in Khayelitsha by what the bus company claimed were people wearing Cosatu sweaters. <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_76 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all IWW Departments and Unions.

<p><strong>By Dean Dempsey - <em>Industrial Worker</em>, June 2006</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../graphics/photos/color/events/Wobblies%20at%20civic%20centerA.jpg" />International Workers Day, 2006, was undoubtedly one of the largest May Day celebrations in U.S. history, as upward of 1.5 million people participated in day long walk-outs, strikes, and protests all across the nation. Chicago estimated 700,000 took part in their May Day action, with one-third of the city&rsquo;s students refusing to attend school. Denver received at least 75,000 people, or one-sixth of the city&rsquo;s population, in a rally outside the state capitol. Los Angles organizers say about one in every four of students were absent as more than one-million people who took part in May Day marches and boycotts.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../../branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

<p>Building off the massive turnout at the April 10th immigrant rights rally in Madison, the Madison General Membership Branch of the IWW will be supporting the call for a General Strike call by the Latino/a community. </p> <p>Madison IWW members will be working towards turning out as many folks as they can for the convergence on the State Capitol, to be held at 12:00 noon, May 1st. To facilitate this, the branch will be encouraging all local IWW jobshops to close their doors on that day. Two collectivly owned businesses with IWW members, the Madison Infoshop and Two Degrees Coffeshop, have already indicated their support. </p> <p>The Madison IWW will be urging other workers to call in sick, take a personal day, or whatever, so that &quot;business/terrorism as usual&quot; does not continue. They are hoping to have a visable presence in the May 1st march and rally and have already printed General Strike posters, as well as a flyer with the May Day resolution of the IWW General Executive Board in Spanish and English. Their overaching theme will be: &quot;No Borders, No States.&quot;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_248 first"><a href="../../branches/all-branches/madison-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Madison  Central General Membership Branch.
