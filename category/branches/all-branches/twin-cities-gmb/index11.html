<img src="../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/unionizesbux.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="358" align="right" />On March 19, a delegation of IWW Starbucks baristas from the Twin Cities crammed themselves into one worker's 3-cylinder Geo Metro and set off on a journey to bring the good word of solidarity unionism to baristas and workers across the lower midwest. Four days later, we returned to the Twin Cities after covering over 1,700 miles, talking to dozens of Starbucks workers about the union, and speaking to enthusiastic audiences in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Iowa City about our efforts to win decent wages, consistent scheduling, and other basic demands through workplace organizing at the world's largest coffee chain.<br />
<br />
Our first stop was KKFI, a community radio station in Kansas City, where the Heartland Labor Forum radio show was kind enough to interview us about our organizing experiences on their show. We then made our way to the Westport Coffee House, where we held a discussion with interested community members about the issues at Starbucks, and the possibility of building a new labor movement from the ground up. We discovered that, just as in every other American city, the Kansas City working class is under attack. The Kansas City School Board recently decided to close an enormous number of schools and lay off many teachers, unionized in the American Federation of Teachers. We extend our solidarity to them and hope that workers and students can unite in defense of quality public education.<br />
<br />
The next day, we hit the road for St. Louis, site of the first general strike in US history in 1877, as well as a giant arch, and the worker-owned and democratically-operated Black Bear Bakery. The Autonomy Alliance and local IWW members sponsored a public event at the bakery, providing us with an opportunity to share the story of our union campaign with local labor activists and workers.<br />

Steady Growth Spurs IWW To Open Space in NE Minneapolis
</p>
<p>
For decades, IWW members in the Twin Cities were without a place to call home, but beginning in November, our branch will open hop in the historic Grain Belt Bottling House in Northeast Minneapolis – a neighborhood hose early residents and their vision of industrial organizing were instrumental in establishing he “One Big Union” here and beyond.

Hello Fellow Workers, Customers and Friends of Aizze!
</div>
<br />
<div>
Thank you so much for your support for Azmera.  By signing the petition, calling-in to Starbucks management, and coming out for a hugely successful picket of the Snelling &amp; Selby store last Saturday, we have sent a strong message to Starbucks that Aizze is not alone and that we will not stand for discrimination. The picket was covered by several media outlets, including the Star Tribune &lt;<a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/53307332.html">http://www.startribune.com/local/53307332.html</a>&gt; and
Pioneer Press &lt;<a href="http://www.twincities.com/life/ci_13132224">http://www.twincities.com/life/ci_13132224</a>&gt;. According
to workers at Snelling &amp; Selby, sales dropped by over 50% during the hour and a half that we picketed the store.
</div>
<br />
<div>
After the picket, Aizze had a brief phone conversation with Becky Critch, Starbucks Human Resources Manager. We had hoped that Starbucks would present an offer, but instead, Critch attempted to dominate the conversation, asking probing questions about Aizze's work history.
</div>
<div>
Critch refused to allow Aizze to answer questions in writing.  After the traumatic experience of her interrogation in the back room of the store, it is highly insulting for management to expect Aizze to submit to further oral questioning.
</div>
<br />
<div>
With no offer from Starbucks on the table, it's time to increase the pressure.
</div>
<br />
<div>
What's Next?
</div>
<br />
<div>
1.  Please continue to call Starbucks Area Director DIMITRI HATZIGEORGIOU at 312-731-8909 to tell him you support Aizze's
demands.
</div>
<br />
<div>
2.  We have invited fellow workers, customers and community members to come and meet Aizze on SUNDAY, AUGUST 30 at 1PM at Coffee con Amore, 917 Grand Avenue, Saint Paul.  This will be an opportunity to hear from Aizze, discuss the next steps in the campaign, and learn more about the Starbucks Workers Union. Join us!
</div>
<br />
<div>
3. During this tough time for Aizze and her family, you may consider making a donation to help Aizze while she is unemployed.  A customer of Aizze's established a fund through PayPal for supporters to make donation directly to Aizze. You can donate at <a href="http://tcsbuxunion.com/">http://tcsbuxunion.com</a>
</div>
<br />
<div>
Again, thank you all so much for your support and solidarity with us in this struggle.

Ask anyone and they’ll tell you that Aizze was the best barista at the
Snelling &amp; Selby Starbucks in St. Paul, MN. She knew every
regular's drink and could make a latte in 28 seconds. She has 20 MUG
awards for her job performance, and was never written up in her two
years of service, nor was her till ever ‘over’ or ‘short.’ Her
coworkers and customers loved her; they called her 'Aizze' (pronounced
'Ozzie'), short for Azmera. This description is in the past tense
because Starbucks wrongfully fired Aizze on July 8, 2009. Starbucks
management accused her of theft, although they themselves ADMIT that
they have no video or other evidence to support their accusation.<br />
<br />
Adding
insult to injury, Saint Paul District Manager Claire Gallagher took
advantage of Aizze’s limited English abilities and bullied and
manipulated her into signing a promissory note saying she would pay
Starbucks the arbitrarily- determined amount of $1200. Acting through
the notoriously anti-worker law firm Olonoff, Asen &amp; Serebro,. LLP,
Starbucks has since sent Aizze a letter threatening to send their
baseless claim to a collections agency.<br />
<br />
Azmera is not a
thief. An immigrant from Ethiopia, Azmera has been a citizen of the
U.S. for the past ten years. She has worked at Starbucks for the past
two years. Together with her husband, a Taxi driver, Azmera is the
proud mother of three young children. Aizze is an honest, deeply
religious woman who loves her job and works hard to care for her family.<br />
<br />
<strong>How did this happen?</strong>
</p>
<p>
On
July 8, 2009, Aizze was told to sit in the back room at the end of her
shift, alone with St. Paul District Manager Claire Gallagher. For
almost two hours, she was not allowed to leave, and no other workers
were allowed to enter. The DM made a conference call with “Partner
&amp; Asset Protection” Manager Chris Vanderhoof and together they
began to interrogate Aizze. When Aizze informed her interrogators that
she did not understand what they were saying, they just repeated the
same words over and over. Aizze was not offered an interpreter. She was
told that if she didn't sign the promissory note, they would call the
police and have her arrested. Thinking of her children, she signed the
paper. Her interrogators told her flatly that they had no proof or
video of her stealing money, yet they accused her of theft. Aizze never
stole. If there was change someone didn’t want from a transaction,
Aizze put it in the tip jar, but she never, ever stole.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why Aizze?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We
can only speculate on why Aizze was targeted, but one thing is clear:
Starbucks thinks they can get away with victimizing her because she is
an immigrant and a non-native English speaker.<br />
<br />
<strong>What You Can Do To Help</strong>
</p>
<p>
We
all have a responsibility to stand up for the most vulnerable amongst
us. We will not sit idly by while Starbucks management victimizes one
who has come to this country seeking a better life. We demand immediate
reinstatement, the immediate nullification of the promissory note, and
an apology to Aizze. Justice must be done for Aizze and all workers.<br />
