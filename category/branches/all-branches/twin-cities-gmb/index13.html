The &quot;Black Friday&quot; rallies in support of the Starbucks Workers union were a
tremendous success today. Many fellow workers took the light rail train from
Minneapolis to the Megamall in Bloomington. Unlike the last time, there were no
riot police to intercept the train. We held a rally on public property, across
from the north entrance to the mall. Speakers from The Starbucks Workers Union,
The IWW, Students for a Democratic Society, and several local progressive trade
unions; all voiced their support to the Starbucks workers and to the right of
those workers to organize.
</div>
<br />
<div>
After the Megamall rally, supporters took the train back to Minneapolis for
a rally at the newest unionized Starbucks store at Nicollet and Franklin. We
presented a &quot;Welcome to the Union&quot; cake to the workers in that store. Even
though the district manager was in the store at the time, events went off
without incident.
</div>
<br />
<div>
After presenting the cake, we went across the street from Starbucks, where
we gave away fair trade coffee which had been donated by a local fair trade
shop. We had several discussions with passers-by concerning our demands that
Starbucks recognize the right of their workers to organize a union, and that
Starbucks pledge to use fair trade coffee in their shops. The idea was to show
that there is a trail of worker exploitation which begins on coffee plantations
where &quot;Third World&quot; workers are paid as little as a dollar a day for their hard
work...and continues with the abuse of Starbuck baristas in the shops where that
coffee is sold.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Congratulations to the courageous workers at the newest organized
Starbucks, and thanks to everyone who participated in today's events.

Press Conferece: 11am November 13, corner of Franklin and
Nicollet
</div>
<br />
<div>
Minneapolis, MN- Baristas from the Starbucks Coffee located at the intersection of Nicollet and Franklin Avenues in Minneapolis walked off the floor Wednesday morning to present a petition to management, signed by more than 500 concerned customers and community members, demanding Starbucks hire a security guard to ensure the safety of its patrons and partners.Â  The workers in turn declared their affiliation with the Starbucks Workers Union, a campaign of the Industrial Workers of the World labor union, becoming the first Starbucks in Minneapolis, and the second in Minnesota, to go union.
</div>
<br />
<div>
A press conference will be held Thursday, November 13, at 11 am, in front of the Franklin and Nicollet Starbucks to celebrate the solidarity of the workers and demand that Starbucks hire a security guard.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Initially, the store partners circulated an internal petition, compiling signatures from most of the store's employees, requesting a meeting to discuss the security situation.Â  After receiving no productive response from either the store or district manager, the employees turned to the
</div>
<div>
customers to prove their point.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;We hoped management would recognize the need to discuss these concerns with us, but when they refused to even hold a meeting, we knew more action was needed,&quot; said Aaron Kocher, a current store employee.Â  &quot;We can't work when we are constantly being harassed, threatened, and intimidated, or trying to protect our customers from the same mistreatment,&quot; he said.

Starbucks Corp. has agreed to a settlement with the National Labor
Relations Board on charges of anti-union activities at its Mall of America store
that stemmed from the July firing of a barista who tried to organize
workers.
</div>
<br />
<div>
The settlement agreement is the third nationally the Seattle-based
corporation has reached with the NLRB concerning alleged efforts to stop workers
from joining a union.
</div>
<br />
<div>
It comes in the wake of the August reinstatement of barista Erik Forman,
who still is trying to organize Starbucks workers at Twin Cities stores into a
union called the Starbucks Workers Union.

<p>
During the first week of September 2008, Republican Party delegates
gathered in St. Paul, Minnesota for the Republican National
Convention
(RNC) - the media spectacle and corporate sleaze-fest that completes
their
nominating process. An army of armor-clad riot police, National Guard,
and
private security with their humvees, rubber bullets, and tear gas
protected them. FBI-assisted sheriff's raids at more than a
half-dozen
activist homes and organizing centers in Minneapolis-St. Paul sought
to
hinder opposition. But thousands of protestors still took to the
streets
to emphatically reject the Republicans' vicious policies of war,
discrimination, and attacks on the working-class and poor.
</p>
<p>
Among the more important mobilizing efforts against the RNC was the
Anti-Capitalist Bloc, an initiative of the Industrial Workers of the
World
(I.W.W.) union - Twin Cities General Membership Branch. The
Anti-Capitalist Bloc was conceived as an organizing front for the week
of
the RNC that would unite those anti-capitalist activists with an
orientation toward organizing. The Anti-Capitalist Bloc issued a
&quot;Call&quot;
and adopted a set of &quot;Solidarity Principles&quot; that made clear our
opposition to not only the Republican party but the whole system of
capitalism. Ten other groups signed on including three other I.W.W
branches. Approximately 1800 full-color posters with the
Anti-Capitalist
Bloc message were distributed over the course of the week.
</p>
<p>
But as Wobblies, we know that words are not enough, and so a series
of
events, actions, and contingents were organized by the
Anti-Capitalist
Bloc.

Today 8/31/08 at 1pm the Twin Cities IWW held at the Lake and Hiawatha
Light Rail Station in solidarity with Starbucks workers and to celebrate
getting our comrade Erik Foreman?s job back.Â  The rally was a great success
with about 100 people showing up.Â  At about 1:45 we all legally boarded the
light rail (using rail passes) and headed down to the Mall of America in order
to escort our fellow worker back to his first shift.Â 
</div>
<br />
<div>
Everyone was peaceful and orderly on the train as we headed south.Â  At
the Bloomington Station we were met by police who asked to speak with us regarding our plans.Â  We informed the police that we did not wish to
cause any trouble, to protest inside of the mall, or to unlawfully assemble in
any way inside the mall.Â  The police told us we should be fine and that we
would not have any trouble.Â  We were then allowed to proceed to the MOA stop.Â 
At the MOA the train was surrounded by police in full riot gear.Â  They threatened to arrest us if we left the train.Â  We were trapped inside
the train for about 20 minutes.Â  The police even prohibited a woman with a
child who needed insulin from leaving the train, endangering the child's
health. After about 10 minutes and only after repeatedly insisting that we had
a
</div>
<div>
medical emergency did the police permit the woman and child to exit
the train.Â  When asked why we were being detained a policeman said: &quot;the
mall doesn't want you here.&quot;Â  The officers? badge numbers were mostly covered
by their gear.
