<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/28/2017 - 4:51pm</p>
<p><strong>By John O&rsquo;Reilly - <a href="https://tcorganizer.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/iww-members-stand-with-fired-ford-union-organizer-in-spain-solidarity-is-strength-en-ingles-y-espanol/" target="_blank"><em>The Organizer</em></a>, April 26, 2017 </strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/20170324_165859.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="180" alt="" />On Friday, March 24<sup>th</sup>, Twin Cities IWW members gathered outside the Roseville Ford dealership to stand in solidarity with a fired union organizer from our sister union in Spain. An organizer with the National Confederation of Labor (or CNT, for its name in Spanish) was fired in retaliation for organizing in Valencia, Spain. His court date for reinstatement was set for March 27<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>A dealership manager approached our members and told them they were annoyed that we were picketing their workplace. The manager insisted that the site was union friendly and then sent out the union representative from the service workers to talk with IWW picketers. IWW member BP reports that &ldquo;after some good conversation with the steward, he said he was on our side and took a large quantity of flyers &ndash; much to the dismay of the manager!&rdquo; Workers from the site soon gathered and mixed with IWW picketers, impressed by the dedication of our members to their coworker in Spain&rsquo;s cause.</p>
<p>Ford&rsquo;s restructuring plan, The Way Forward, lays out a strategy of closing down plants in the US and moving them overseas to countries where the wages are lower. That&rsquo;s why, as IWW member ED&nbsp;points out, &ldquo;the Twin Cities factory shut down, taking away 2000 well payed union jobs, while production is ramping up in Spain, where labor laws are changing to make firing workers easier.&rdquo; But the strategy only works as long as wages remain low in those countries. &ldquo;So, by busting unions in Spain, Ford can keep outsourcing jobs, which busts unions here in the US. An injury to one is very much an injury to all,&rdquo; ED&nbsp;adds.</p>
<p>The working class in the United States and globally is under attack by the international capitalists and their buddies in government. By moving labor and attacking workers organizations, the bosses try to keep us divided and fighting with each other, instead of working across national boundaries. Outsourcing only works if unions around the world are kept divided and weak. As ED&nbsp;points out: &ldquo;Global capitalism can only be answered with global labor solidarity!&rdquo;</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/13/2016 - 5:06pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://m1aa.org/?p=1316">First of May Anarchist Alliance</a>, December 4, 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/TC_GDC_Defend.preview.jpg" alt="" align="right" />A PDF of this interview is <a href="http://m1aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GDC-Interview.pdf"><em>here</em></a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>The General Defense Committee of the Industrial Workers World (IWW) has become an important pole of struggle for pro-working-class revolutionaries in the Twin Cities. While active on a number of different fronts it is the participation of the General Defense Committee (GDC) in the year-long struggle against police killings and brutality in the Twin Cities that has largely led to the significant growth of the organization. The GDC has grown to approximately 90 dues-paying members in Minnesota, and has several active working-groups. In the wake of Trump&rsquo;s election victory, Wobblies<sup>(1)</sup></em> <em>and others across the country have begun establishing their own GDC locals &ndash; strongly influenced by the Twin Cities&rsquo; model.</em></p>
<p>Interview:</p>
<p><strong>First of May Anarchist Alliance</strong> spoke to Erik D. secretary of the Twin Cities GDC Local 14 about the history and work of the General Defense Committee there. Erik is a father, husband, education worker, and wobbly, who&rsquo;s also been involved in the youth-focused intergenerational group, the Junior Wobblies.</p>
<p><strong>Fellow Worker Erik &ndash; can you tell us about the origins and history of the General Defense Committee, its relationship to the IWW and how the militants who founded the current Local conceived of it?</strong></p>
<p>As I understand it, the General Defense Committee (GDC) was first founded by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1917, in response to the repression of wobblies and anti-WWI draft protests. I haven&rsquo;t learned enough about the historic GDC to really speak much about it. I joined the IWW in 2006, and we didn&rsquo;t formally charter the current local as a GDC until 2011. In 2011, the committee was 13 wobblies. But we had actually started organizing ourselves prior to 2011, calling ourselves the Local Defense Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Are there historical or modern examples or inspirations that influence the way GDC sees itself, its activity and organization?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve appreciated about the Twin Cities GDC is the very practical intention to learn, with a specific focus on learning in order to act. From the very beginning we engaged in mutual education. Since one of our early orientations was to anti-fascist and anti-racist work, we did a fair bit of reading on the topic of fascism and anti-fascism (Sunday mornings with coffee).</p>
<p>I mention this period of mutual education because we have a lot of inspirations, but none of them have been role models, per se. We have looked to previous movements largely in order to inform our own work and to learn from our elders and the experience of previous generations, but not as Role Models To Be Emulated. That&rsquo;s been important.</p>
<p>With that caveat, we have a lot of inspiration. I get new inspiration every time I read a book, it seems. Some of the inspiration is local: here, I&rsquo;d specifically highlight Anti-Racist Action and Teamsters Local 544. Anti-Racist Action (ARA) came out of a Minneapolis-based group of anti-racist skinheads who decided they needed to find a way to kick racist skins and organized fascists out of the Twin Cities. Teamsters Local 544 was the local that organized the 1934 strike that made Minneapolis a union town, innovated new forms of the picket (specifically, the &lsquo;flying picket&rsquo;), and engaged for a short time in open physical confrontation on the streets.</p>
<p>Beyond the Twin Cities, I think our members have a lot of very different inspirations. One of mine has always been John Brown, but I grew up partly in Kansas. I guess the Black Panther Party would be the most common source of inspiration among early members; our advocacy of Community Self Defense certainly owes a lot to the Panthers, including their Survival Programs. The most recent addition to my &lsquo;Hall of Inspiration&rsquo; is Rudy Shields, whom I learned about from Akinyele Omowale Umoja&rsquo;s <em>We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement.</em></p>
<p><strong>One of the first projects of the Twin Cities GDC was organizing a &ldquo;Picket Training&rdquo;, which seems like a kind of simple project, but you all attached some importance to it. How come?</strong></p>
<p>I think the history of the Picket Training is actually the beginning of the history of the local GDC, so forgive me for a longer answer. The IWW was always heavily involved in local May Day events, naturally. In both 2007 and 2008 we had dispiriting and potentially dangerous experiences in marches that were organized by other groups. These happened when we were &lsquo;out-marshaled&rsquo; and &lsquo;peace-policed.&rsquo; Folks might remember the 2006 &ldquo;Day Without An Immigrant.&rdquo; In 2007 immigrant protection and rights continued to be major issues, and the march was partly centered around pro-immigrant demands.</p>
<p>So it was worrying when wobblies who had been active in local anti-fascist actions saw someone they thought they knew from a fascist rally elsewhere in the state videotaping the crowd (we were never able to confirm the identity because of what happened next). Fascists videotaping an immigrants rights march is extremely concerning; they were likely videotaping either to research immigrants rights&rsquo; groups (including antifa groups), or to identify potentially undocumented people.</p>
<p>A few wobblies went to talk to the videotaper and get in the way of the camera. Shouting commenced, and the self-appointed organizers of the march successfully pushed the wobblies back into the crowd, allowing the videotaping to continue.</p>
<p>The May Day parade the next year found wobblies promoting militant chants shut down by the same sort of marshals.</p>
<p>At roughly the same time, the local IWW was doing a lot of organizing. While some of us had prior experience in organizing pickets and direct actions, the Starbucks Workers campaign, the Jimmy John&rsquo;s campaign, the Sisters Camelot Canvas Union, and the Chicago-Lake Liquors campaigns all provided early experience and training in planning and executing pickets and direct actions, in a context where we were already committed to IWW ideas and practices. Some of these were particularly challenging, such as doing intelligence and the occasional flying picket of scab canvassers in the Sisters Camelot campaign. Since they never stayed put, it felt like a throwback to the 1934 strikes and the flying pickets. It was cold both Winters.</p>
<p>There was one particular occasion at the University of Minnesota AFSCME strike in 2007 where the IWW promoted, and executed, a hard picket line in the early morning hours at a delivery dock. This was going extremely well until a UMN delivery truck driver rammed the picket line. I was in the wrong place at the moment, and ended up on his hood. I found out later I&rsquo;d crushed three neck vertebrae; it took two surgeries and a lot of physical therapy to get past it. It also gave me a serious motivation for doing pickets and direct actions better. Just a week after a truck hit me, a delivery truck hit another picketer at an IWW picket of D&rsquo;Amico&rsquo;s restaurant, thankfully without serious consequences.</p>
<p>Finally, 2008 was the end of an intense two-year process organized at disrupting the Republican National Convention. Most of us already had a critique of &lsquo;summit hopping&rsquo; styles of disruption, few of which have been effective since before the FTAA in Miami 2003. But a number of wobblies were serious and on occasion influential participants in (at least the early period of) the two years of planning that ended up calling itself the &ldquo;Welcoming Committee.&rdquo; The Welcoming Committee meetings (which were held in the same community space as the early IWW at the time, the Jack Pine Community Center) hammered out some early agreements and principles, including, along with other interested groups, the well-known Saint Paul Principles. This process also gave local wobblies experience in critically thinking through on-the-street tactics and what it would take to actually win goals and actions on those streets, whether in labor pickets or direct actions<sup>(2)</sup>.<sup><br />
</sup></p>
<p>All these motivations and experiences were in the forefront of our minds when we thought up the picket training. We knew we had to get better at this, and though we all had some experience, that&rsquo;s not the same thing as having teachable knowledge. So we researched, wrote, debated, and practiced. We adopted a principle of teaching the tactics quickly rather than perfecting the training first, and encouraged people to think about themselves as the next trainers. In order to keep track of our curriculum and to make it portable, we created a trainer&rsquo;s manual, a trainee manual, and a setup manual, which we update frequently.</p>
<p>We offer the trainings to non-wobblies, and while we avoid being an on-call security group, we are trusted locally as providing quality security and planning successful actions. With the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and on-the-streets protest since Ferguson, I think the GDC has earned a bit of respect from other local organizations as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Statement on Opposing All Oppression from the <a href="https://twincitiesgdc.org/antifascism/" target="_blank">Twin Cities GDC Local 14</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Didnottread.jpg" width="400" height="225" align="right" alt="" />1. ANY SUCCESSFUL WORKER REVOLUTION WILL REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM DIVERSE MEMBERS OF THE WORKING CLASS, CURRENTLY DIVIDED BY MANY OPPRESSIONS.</strong></p>
<p>We fight against capitalism. We do so because capitalism is organized theft based on hierarchy. We unionize because fighting this authoritarian theft can be done most successfully in the workplace, at the point of production. In unionizing we face many challenges, from creating strategies and tactics to accomplish our goals, as well as maintaining morale, fighting spirit, and solidarity with each other.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult challenges the working class faces is that of oppressive social divisions. We may be of a single class, but we are not the same as a result. In addition to experiencing the oppressions of our class, we have differing experiences of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism and Islamphobia, along with other types of oppressions. Some of us experience privilege on the basis of our race, sex, gender, or religion, while others among us experience oppression on precisely the same grounds.</p>
<p>The ruling classes know this, of course. It is one of their favorite strategies for destroying organized workers: divide and conquer. Many of these oppressions exist in starkest relief in America&rsquo;s massive prison-industrial system, where wardens encourage and enforce racial segregation and violence among prisoners, precisely as a system of maintaining control. These forms of control through oppression are not limited to prisons, of course. We see and experience them in our daily lives, and in our workplaces as well.</p>
<p>To maintain solidarity with all workers requires that we maintain explicit solidarity with workers on the diverse grounds of their oppression. Our revolution cannot maintain a merely minimal, workerist, program which concentrates on the oppression of labor and leaves other problems solely to those workers who face them. Given the still relatively homogenous makeup of the Industrial Workers of the World, to do so sends a clear message to the working class experiencing such oppressions that the class struggle and their struggles against racism, gendered, or religious oppression are separate issues. If you were already struggling to keep the basics of your life together in the face of constant attacks on your person, would you be interested in taking on another massive but unconnected struggle in your workplace? By pointing out the ways in which struggles against all oppression support and further our collective freedom from class and other oppressions, we gain strength as a union.</p>
<p>Neither have we proceeded, historically, with a minimal program of workplace organization that leaves other oppressions unchallenged. The Industrial Workers of the World were founded in 1905 in part precisely to overcome the divisions of race, sex, religion, language, nationality, etc., among the working class. Militantly in favor of the organization of the entire working class, Wobblies quickly turned toward the power of young women in garment factories, racially-mixed work-gangs on the waterfronts, and nationally diverse immigrant groups. The IWW took on the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations that attempted to divide the class on the grounds of race. More recently, some IWW branches have begun to successfully undermine the divisions of oppressions based on gendered identities in ways that seem truly revolutionary.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 04/04/2016 - 6:28pm</p>
<p><b>By Ikemba Kuti - <a target="_blank" href="https://libcom.org/library/4th-precinct-black-anarchist’s-perspective-struggle-minneapolis’-northside-streets-ikemb">First of May Anarchist Alliance</a>, March 25, 2016</b></p>
<p><img width="320" align="right" height="240" src="https://libcom.org/files/imagecache/article/images/library/4thPrecintAPCBanner.jpg" alt="" />On November 15th, 2015, police executed Jamar Clark in North Minneapolis, MN. Several witnesses claim that Mr. Clark was handcuffed and on the ground when he was shot in the head. Following the execution, an occupation of the 4th precinct police station took place on Plymouth Avenue.</p>
<p>The call for the encampment and occupation came from Black Lives Matter &ndash; Minneapolis. BLM-MPLS, is a part of the nation-wide organization of chapters that is backed by the Democratic Party of the same system that ensures black and brown communities are hyper- policed. BLM-St. Paul is not a part of the nation-wide organization, and has even been condemned for making Black Lives Matter as a whole &ldquo;look bad&rdquo; for simply chanting &ldquo;Pigs in a blanket, fry &lsquo;em like bacon&hellip;&rdquo; while they are not a chartered chapter.</p>
<p>BLM-MPLS&rsquo; call for the encampment resulted in BLM organizers heading the movement with little to no democratic process until later in the struggle. The encampment also generated tensions arising from different agendas, ideologies, levels of anger, and an array of different tactics that different organizations and members of the community aimed to use.</p>
<p>The nationally connected Black Lives Matter-Minneapolis did, and does, great work at getting people to come out. Unfortunately, they also do great work channeling that revolutionary energy into their dogmatic nonviolent reformism due to an undeniable affiliation with the Democratic Party (the system), which must be noted by those interested in liberation of the people, and which is quickly revealed through research on those who are heading #CampaignZero (Black Lives Matter flow chart to attain a world with limited police terror).</p>
<p>Take note of campaign zero&rsquo;s four person &ldquo;planning team&rdquo; these are important facts: &ldquo;In 2014, Brittany helped bring community voice to the Ferguson Commission and President Obama&rsquo;s Task Force on 21st Century Policing as an appointee to each. She&rsquo;s been named one of TIME Magazine&rsquo;s 12 New Faces of Black Leadership&rdquo;<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_rescowm" title="http://www.joincampaignzero.org/about/" href="https://libcom.org/library/4th-precinct-black-anarchist’s-perspective-struggle-minneapolis’-northside-streets-ikemb#footnote1_rescowm">1</a>. This individual works directly for the president.</p>
<p>The remaining three are also heavily connected to non-profits such as Teach for America (TFA), which is also historically connected to maintaining the system. For example: TFA was recently given a grant to continue to project their brand through the media. Furthermore, another member of this four-person team was the other recipient; she is the director of St Louis TFA. TFA is, effectively, the leading edge of the neoliberal attempts to gut city schools and further hinder education equity, which in turn systemically hinders black and brown kids educational achievement under the guise of helping those kids.</p>
<p>As an anarchist, of African descent, I argue that we need revolutionary struggle controlled by the grassroots and not by top-down leaders. It was the domination of top-down leadership from BLM-Minneapolis, and their seemingly unconscious commitment to the system, that effectively steered Northside community militants away from 1) the encampment, 2) becoming further politicized, and 3) in playing any role in the organizing of their own communities self-determination. Their voices were effectively hushed; just as the system we function under has done for centuries to oppressed people of color.</p>

<p><b>By FW W.H. Glazer - <a target="_blank" href="http://tcorganizer.com/2016/01/20/on-voting-by-fw-w-h-glazer/">Twin Cities IWW</a>, January 20, 2016</b></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b><img width="400" height="296" align="right" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/voting.jpg" />Introduction</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Every four years, Americans are subjected to a painfully long election cycle. It is January of a presidential election year, and that means that we can anticipate another ten months of mainstream media coverage that manages to simultaneously overwhelm us with its volume and leave us with no novel or useful information (did you know, for example, that Dr. Ben Carson was a rageful and violent nerd growing up in Detroit? Or that Donald Trump is a shameless blowhard whose racist, classist, and sexist rhetoric appeals to a sizeable group of racists, classists, and sexists?). My boss loves to play CNN in the office as background noise, but my proximity to the television means that I know a lot more about Martin O&rsquo;Malley and Carly Fiorina than I ever needed to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Inherent in the decision to enact non-stop coverage is an assumption that all of this election stuff really matters, that who you support and ultimately vote for can have a tangible effect on the lives of millions of people. We are taught from a young age that our right to vote is a tremendously precious one, and further that failure to participate in the election process is a failure of civic duty. We are Americans, god dammit, and it is our responsibility to uphold justice and liberty and democracy through our voting process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">From a pragmatic standpoint, there is actually some truth to this idea. It is, from a purely practical point of view, smart to vote for the lesser of two evils. Hillary Clinton is less likely to impose anti-Muslim immigration reforms than is Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders is considerably less scary and objectionable than are the cackling hyenas who comprise the Republican field. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the IWW, though, we can&rsquo;t only think in terms of pragmatism and practicality. We are a revolutionary anti-capitalist union, and it can be convincingly argued that active participation in electoral politics is not only counterproductive for our organizational goals, but counter-revolutionary. After all, no major party candidate will ever advocate for the dissolution of our capitalist economy and the establishment of a worker run society. Voting third party in a presidential race may be more morally justifiable, but barring tremendous social and political upheaval, a third party candidate will never take the White House.</span></p>
