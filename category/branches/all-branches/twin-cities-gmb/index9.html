</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 09/16/2010 - 3:55am</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns1.jpg" align="right" width=250 height=187 />MINNEAPOLIS - Sandwich workers at nine Minneapolis Jimmy John's locations made history Monday as they filed for the first-ever National Labor Relations Board union election at the national fast food chain.</p>
<p>If a majority of workers vote in favor of unionization, franchise owner Mike Mulligan will be legally bound to negotiate with a bargaining team elected by his employees.</p>
<p>"Since we formed a union 11 days ago, Mike Mulligan has refused to even talk to us. We intend to keep the pressure on management to meet our demands. They may be able to stonewall us for now, but when we win this election, Jimmy Johns will have no choice but to negotiate," said Mike Wilkow, a Jimmy Johns Workers Union member.</p>
<p>Since workers at nine Minneapolis Jimmy John's locations announced the formation of a union and demanded negotiations with franchise management on Sept. 2, the chain has been bombarded with an escalating campaign of actions in 32 states intended to bring management to the bargaining table. The Jimmy Johns Workers Union's demands include sick days, a no-nonsense worker's compensation policy, fair scheduling, livable wages, an end to sexual harassment, and other measures of basic fairness at work.</p>
<p>Franchise owner Mike Mulligan and general manager Rob Mulligan have ignored the union's repeated requests for negotiations. Union members say managers have begun using typical union-busting tactics, such as distributing threatening letters, calling employees into irregular one-on-one meetings, and making concessions to individual workers on demands around wages and hours.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is the first fast food union in the nation, and is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB" class="active">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

</h2>

<p><b><a href=" " target="_blank">By Christine Des Garennes - The <i>News-Gazette</i>, September 15, 2010</a></b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns3.jpg" align="right" />
Employees of a Jimmy John&#39;s franchise in Minnesota have organized a union and are seeking better pay, better working conditions and more benefits.</p>
<p>
Right now the campaign is focused on organizing employees in the Minneapolis metropolitan area. The Jimmy John&#39;s sandwich chain, which has over 1,000 stores across the country, is headquartered in Champaign.</p>
<p>
An &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of sandwich workers at the Minneapolis stores favored forming a bargaining unit, according to union member and Jimmy John&#39;s worker Mike Wilklow. On Monday the group filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board to start the formal election process; that election is expected to take place in the coming months, Wilklow said.</p>
<p>
Once a majority of employees vote in favor of forming the union, the Minneapolis franchise owner must start negotiating with the union&#39;s bargaining team, he said.</p>
<p>
Workers announced the formation of the union earlier this month and have picketed outside several Minnesota stores since Labor Day. The union is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World, which has been helping Starbucks workers organize in recent years.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB" class="active">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU330/IU330Logo2color.jpg" align="right" />The Construction Workers Organizing Committee of the Industrial Workers of the World wishes to express our deepest solidarity with the Jimmy Johns Workers union. As union construction workers, we understand that the only way to maintain and raise both our wages and working conditions is to show solidarity with not only workers of the various trades within construction; but also with workers of other industries. Solidarity means having a true understanding of the old saying, <b>An injury to one is an injury to all</b>.</p>
<p>Solidarity is also the action that springs from this understanding. The greatest action of solidarity that one can follow is the exercising of the <b>right to not cross any picket lines</b>.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that times are hard. The construction industry has been hit especially hard, and many brothers and sisters in the trades are not working. This means that what little work we get, we desperately need.
However, as construction workers; we also understand that <b>in these hard times, we must act and be stronger than ever before!</b> For hundreds of years, construction worker have fought long and hard battles, through many recessions, to reach the level of pay and the amount of power we have on the job. We certainly should not let this recession destroy the progress we have made.</p>
<p>The Construction Workers Organizing Committee and the construction workers of the IWW promise to continue to not cross picket lines! No matter what union or what industry, we will continue to act out solidarity and exercise our rights under <u>section 7 of the NLRA</u>: to act in concert with fellow workers to uphold the best interest of the working class. We urge all construction workers to do the same!</p>
<p><b>Who we are:</b> The Construction Workers Organizing Committee or CWOC is a subordinate body of the Industrial Workers of the World. Our aim is to organize ALL construction workers into ONE democratic fighting union.

<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns1.jpg" align="right" height="187" width="250" />MINNEAPOLIS - Jimmy John's franchise owners Mike and Rob Mulligan awoke to an unpleasant surprise last week as employees disrupted construction of the newest store in the chain with picket lines.</p>
<p>The picketing sandwich workers appealed to members of Minneapolis building trades unions working on the new store to down their tools until the Mulligans agree to meet with the newly-formed Jimmy Johns Workers Union.</p>
<p>“If Mike and Rob Mulligan have $300,000 to open another Jimmy Johns, then they have the money to meet our demands for a decent wage, consistent hours, and basic fairness at work. If they're not going to meet with us, then we have no choice but to hit them where it hurts. We are happy with the outcome of today's action– construction at the site was delayed for about an hour,” said Davis Ritsema, a member of the union.</p>
<p>Most construction workers employed under a union contract in Minnesota have the right to refuse to cross picket lines. Under Minnesota state law, motor vehicles are required to come to a complete stop at picket lines so that picketers can appeal to the driver not to cross the line.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is the first fast food union in the nation, and is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB" class="active">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_38 last"><a href="../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/general-distributi/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from General Distribution Workers Industrial Union 660.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 09/06/2010 - 3:09pm</p>
<p><b>Still no response from corporate headquarters</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU640/picket-bannersm.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS - In the true spirit of Labor Day, supporters of the Jimmy Johns Workers Union in 32 states nationwide will take to the streets in an unprecedented National Week of Action to pressure Minneapolis franchise owner MikLin enterprises to meet with their workers.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis alone, more than 200 union members and supporters are expected to rally at the University of Minnesota for a performance by local hip-hop stars I Self Divine and Guante, followed by a march on two area stores.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Jimmy Johns Workers Union, the first chapter in the country, is riding high on the momentum of several days of successful demonstrations and pickets in Minneapolis with crowds in the hundreds.</p>
<p>The union says actions will intensify as long as owner Mike Mulligan and General Manager Rob Mulligan refuse to meet with the union. “The Mulligans need to know that we aren't just hard-working employees, but students and parents; real people with real concerns. These are our lives. We're tired of being ignored and degraded at job after low wage job. We're tired of being expendable,” said Jake Foucalt, a union member in Minneapolis. “The pressure will continue to build until we are listened to.”</p>
<p>The national corporate headquarters of Jimmy Johns has yet to respond to the unionization campaign, the first at the expanding sandwich empire. The union effort could have profound implications for other employers in the fast food industry, a sector known for the lowest rate of unionization– and lowest wages– in the United Sates. Only 1.8% of food service workers were represented by a union in 2009, far below the nation-wide figure of 12.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>A person working 30 hours a week on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 would make $3260 below the federal poverty line for a family of two. Jimmy Johns pays minimum wage and maintains a corporate policy of discouraging managers from scheduling workers more than 20 hours per week.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB" class="active">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../../../campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.
