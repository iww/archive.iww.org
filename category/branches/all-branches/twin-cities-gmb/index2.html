<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 01/18/2016 - 10:31pm</p>
<p><strong>By Coeur de Bord - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2016/01/17/15-at-ups-by-fw-coeur-de-bord/" target="_blank"><em>The Organizer</em></a>, January 17, 2016</strong></p>
<p>Eleven months ago, the Package Handler&rsquo;s Organizing Committee (PHOC) voted to begin a campaign demanding the starting wage at the three UPS hubs in the Twin Cities be raised to $15/hour (from the current $10), and a corresponding $5/hour raise for all hub employees. &nbsp;We had our sights set on building power towards some form of disruptive action during 2015&rsquo;s Peak Season. &nbsp;Now that Peak has arrived, I would like to share some of my feelings on the progression, evolution, and execution of this campaign, as well as some ways it has influenced our organizing in general at UPS in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I feel this document is useful as part of a future retrospective assessment of the Boxmart campaign and the PHOC committee itself. &nbsp;However, I hope it can also serve as a useful reference for other IWW organizing committees thinking about taking on labor-intensive, medium- to long-term campaigns such as this. &nbsp;Whether or not such a campaign would have a positive impact on your organizing is a decision that only your committee can make, but I hope that by offering my perspectives other Wobblies will be able to make a more informed decision.</p>
<h3><b>The motion </b><b><i>(original language)</i></b><b>:</b></h3>
<p><i>Notes 16/01/15</i></p>
<p><i>What: $5 hourly raise across the board, which would bring starting wage up to $15. Also, end petty wage theft and other shop floor issues where possible.</i></p>
<p><i>When: Major direct action during peak season 2015 aimed at entire Twin Cities operation. &nbsp;Smaller DAs before them, at moments to be determined. Campaign to start within two months (petitions coming out along with Screw ups at MPLS, Eagan, Maple Grove and airport).</i></p>
<p><i>Who: Petition to be drafted by core committee, Mass meeting to be run by &mdash;&mdash;, other tasks delegated to &mdash;, &mdash;- and &mdash; wherever possible to gather support from rest of branch. New shop floor contacts will be expected to further trenchwork on shop floor, canvass for issues to be addressed by escalating Direct Actions, and inoculation. OTC to arrange an OT soon after mass meeting for new contacts. Core committee (eg &mdash;&ndash;) to fill in gaps where people cannot attend a full OT. &nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Where: Meetings at TC IWW office, actions in MPLS, Eagan, Maple Grove and airport. &nbsp;Actions to focus on Minnesota operation unless tempting opportunities arise.</i></p>
<p><i>How:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i> Use petition to gather contacts for mass meeting. Create Facebook, etc contact points.</i></li>
<li><i> Use mass meeting to identify people willing and able to be organizers (and other roles) and set broad outlines of effort, changing as necessary to reflect workers&rsquo; concerns.</i></li>
<li><i> Follow up with potential organizers, get to OT where possible and patch with one-on-</i><i>ones where not. Create a campaign committee to broaden work, bring in smaller escalatable issues (eg petty wage theft, harassment etc), grow committee itself.</i></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><i> Do direct actions on smaller issues, symbolic stuff where appropriate. Include off-shop-floor issues eg prison slave labour ala hands up don&rsquo;t ship.</i></li>
<li><i> Follow up on retaliation for the above.</i></li>
<li><i> Bring smaller issues back in, build excitement and commitment and hold mass meetings in the months leading up to peak to organize peak action.</i></li>
<li><i> Mess everything up during peak.</i></li>
<li><i> Publicize concessions and workers&rsquo; eye view analysis of fight, follow up on retaliations.</i></li>
<li><i> Set further goals.</i></li>
</ol>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 12/23/2015 - 9:42pm</p>
<p><b>By Keno Evol - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2015/12/22/4thprecinctshutdown-a-statement-on-magic-and-resistance/" target="_blank">Twin Cities IWW</a>, December 22, 2015<br />
</b></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/keno-15.jpg" />Still there is magic. Throughout the days I&rsquo;ve spent at the 4th precinct, on that sacred, now spiritual road of Plymouth Avenue, I have seen what I&rsquo;ve imagined in my mind&rsquo;s eye for quite some time &ndash;&nbsp;a community blockade of resistance. I say sacred intentionally. Throughout black history the shedding of black blood has made things sacred. Consider the way we view voting. Often the argument is that it&rsquo;s necessary to vote, because there is blood on these ballots. The people who came before us suffered so we can show up to the booth. This is true, though I think the idea distorts and manipulates people&rsquo;s commitment to figuring out their own consciousness and defining for themselves what activism really is. It creates a sort of guilt complex around the trauma of our elders. I&rsquo;m thinking of <em>A letter to Maria </em>when June Jordan writes, <em>&ldquo;So voting, or the right to vote, was a goal, yes, but not an overriding objective, nor was it a strategy, nor was it a tactic. The overriding objective was freedom from American apartheid.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>I also say spirituality intentionally, though not in terms of organized religion. But in terms of organizing around a common suffering, an approach which lends itself to a certain otherworldliness taking place &ndash;&nbsp;in this case within North Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I would go as far as to say the entire nation is in a moment of magic. I say magic within two categories of the word. For white Americans, I mean it in the most exhaustingly literal of terms. A Black boy vanishes and white America has a moment of immediate awe! They can&rsquo;t believe it! Where did the black boy go? The cop, the magician in this ritual, knows what a person in his trade would know about fooling the audience. Tragically unsurprised, however, black people living in this country know where every mirror, every smoke canister and every trap door is placed. This is what I mean by magic centered in white America.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 11/30/2015 - 9:03pm</p>
<p><i><b>We prepared this short piece after several comrades were&nbsp;badjacketed&nbsp;in public and with pictures on social media at the 4th Precinct Shutdown.</b>&nbsp;We believe those individual cases have been dealt with, and don&rsquo;t wish to cause unnecessary division by complaining, or publicly calling any group or individual out. Instead,&nbsp;<b>this is intended to provoke reflection</b>, and conversation, amongst all of us, as to how to deal with the suspicions we may have of people we don&rsquo;t know in our growing movements, without creating the sorts of divisions among ourselves that does the work of the State and the police for them. We intend to act in solidarity with those who know how to act in solidarity.</i><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><i>We ask that all organizations and groups working for a better world in which we have killed White Supremacy, Capitalism, and all other forms of oppression, consider that (1) none of us represent the mandate of all the people, (2) that we may have instead genuine and important strategic and tactical differences between ourselves about the best ways to accomplish that world, (3) that&nbsp;<b>we will not win by pretending these differences do not exist, or dictating against difference, but instead by engaging on these differences in the most democratic and least hierarchical ways&nbsp;possible.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Therefore, we ask that groups and individuals read this document against the practice ofbadjacketing, discuss it, and consider publicly endorsing here that we will refrain from the practices of&nbsp;badjacketing.</b>&nbsp;This is not a call to be lax about security; indeed, many of us have been very involved in the provision of security at the Fourth Precinct. Instead, it is a call to be democratic and accountable about our security practices.&nbsp;<b>Please indicate your endorsement in the comments below.</b></i></p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-26 at 2.52.04 PM" src="https://twincitiesgdcdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-26-at-2-52-04-pm.jpeg?w=660" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party, and Anna Mae Aquash of AIM.</em></p>
<p>Every time people organize for liberation, autonomy, and a better world, the state and the bosses try to crush our movements. They don&rsquo;t particularly care how they do it, but they don&rsquo;t want to work hard. It&rsquo;s easier for them, if we do it for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can do this by misportraying us in the media, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sowing distrust and division within or between movements, and they do.</li>
<li>They can do this by harassing our people and preventing them from getting jobs, or demoralizing them with constant police contact, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sending infiltrators into our groups, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by encouraging fascist groups to attack us, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by directly and openly attacking us with police, and they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps the easiest and most effective thing they can do to neutralize and destroy our movements for liberation is to encourage us to act paranoid and to refuse each other&rsquo;s solidarity. One of the most effective techniques for this is called&nbsp;<b><span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;</b>(aka &lsquo;snitchjacketing,&rsquo; &lsquo;badjacketing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad-rapping&rsquo;), and it&rsquo;s when one of our own (or a paid infiltrator) accuses others without cause or evidence of being a infiltrator, threat, or security risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>BADJACKETING:&nbsp;</b>creating suspicion, by spreading rumors or unsubstantiated accusations, that people are undercovers, infiltrators, snitches, or cooperators. Sometimes this is done out of fear and paranoia. But normally, those who &lsquo;lay jackets&rsquo; on others want to consolidate their control over a movement and feel threatened in their authority. It&rsquo;s a favorite tactic of the State in destroying movements of liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tactics of the state and the police go together, and&nbsp;<span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;often leads to direct violence and the destruction of movements. If you&rsquo;re still reading, let&rsquo;s take a look at two well known regional cases: the State assassination of Illinois Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark Clark (1969), and the murder of American Indian Movement militant and Anna Mae Aquash (Mi&rsquo;kmaq) (1975).</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 4:48pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2015/10/10/twin-cities-iww-wins-unpaid-wages-from-local-daycare/" target="_blank">Twin Cities IWW</a>, October 10, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="180" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/TwinCitiesDayCare1.jpg" alt="" />This summer, IWW member Anja was fired from her job at Crocus Hill Academy, a daycare. She was told that it was for talking to current and former coworkers about issues with their boss, Imran Khan. Two weeks later, Anja had yet to receive her final paycheck, her personal belongings, or a copy of her personnel file, which she had requested. Three union members from the Twin Cities IWW branch accompanied Anja to the daycare to deliver a demands letter. Mr. Khan reacted aggressively, shouting at and threatening the union delegation, accusing Anja of mistreating children, and calling St. Paul Police. He refused to accept the letter, and police asked IWW members to vacate the property.</p>
<p>The following day, a larger group of IWW members leafleted the daycare. As Mr. Khan yelled from the door, union members talked to parents about Anja&rsquo;s firing and other grievances. Upon Mr. Khan&rsquo;s continued refusal to receive the letter, branch members conducted a call-in and social media campaign against Crocus Hill Academy. Within a few days, Anja received a call from the school&rsquo;s new director, begging her to give him a copy of the demands which Mr. Khan refused to accept. She has since received her final paycheck and an additional check for $120 to compensate for her personal belongings and personnel file, both of which Mr. Khan &ldquo;misplaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manipulative, lying bosses like Mr. Khan are a danger to all working people, especially when they punish workers for protected activity like talking about work conditions and steal wages. But when we stand alone, or when we look to the government for help, we give up our power to fight. When we come together with other working people, we can get what we deserve. Direct action works and solidarity wins. Get in touch with the Twin Cities IWW if you have problems at work.</p>

<p>On September 1, people who want to undermine our union created a fake indymedia facebook page and used it to publicly publish a phony press release meant to look like it was written by us. This press release falsely claimed that we had called an end to our strike.</p>
<p>This fake press release is clearly meant to confuse people into unknowingly working against the rights of the striking workers by fundraising for or giving money to Sisters' Camelot while the fundraisers are still on strike. This statement is meant to help clarify this confusion created by such dishonesty.</p>
<p>We are still on strike. We are the fundraisers from Sisters' Camelot.
