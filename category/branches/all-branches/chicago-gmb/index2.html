In support of the recent UE occupation of Republic Windows, the Chicago IWW has responded by forming UE Workers Solidarity Committee to provide support for the sit in strikers.  The committee is comprised of diverse organizations to primarily act as a flying squad in case of eviction or action taken against the workers.  The committee is working to coordinate food, water, media work and outreach.<br />
<br />
The RWSC is asking other IWW Branches to take action on Wednesday 12:00 at Bank of America locations in their cities.  Because events around the strike are happening quickly, please contact the organizers in case of changes.  Also, if possible take a picture or write an article and send it to the committee.  Bring banners, flags, and signs and demand No More Bailouts For The Ruling Class!! <br />

The corporations got sloppy. From the hedge-fund parasites to the housing market fraudsters, the corporate criminals have shown their hand. Their filthy fingerprints are all over the economic pain blanketing the country and the world.<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury, the corporate agents in government, also known as politicians, are looting incomprehensible billions of dollars to turn over to the fat-cat executives.<br />
<br />
Working families have long known the pain of stagnant wages, steep rents, and unaffordable heath care and education in the United States. But there’s no doubt that this recession has squeezed the vise beyond what many of us have seen in our lifetimes.<br />
<br />
What’s invigorating and critically important though is the rising awareness that corporations are to blame for the current calamity, and that this crisis is not merely, “a force of nature.” Working people across the country are pointing the blame where it belongs. The elites understand this rising public awareness of corporate wrongdoing as well. How else to explain President George W. Bush feeling obligated to give a speech last month in New York defending capitalism itself?<br />
<br />
According to this year’s Gallup survey on opinions toward 25 business sectors, all but one sector (sports) suffered a decline in esteem. The real estate industry suffered the greatest decline in positive ratings for any industry in the history of the poll. Only 16% of those questioned had a positive view of the real estate business. Banking also suffered a precipitous drop from 50% rating it positively last year to just 36% giving a favorable nod this year.<br />
<br />
The combination of economic pain and rising awareness of corporate culpability has created a tremendous opportunity for workplace and community organizers interested in transformational change. This is our time: time to step up the intensity of our outreach and organizing around demands which challenge the dominance of the corporations in our lives.<br />

</h2>

<em>As of Friday morning, 200 angry UE Local 1110 workers have occupied the The Republic Windows and Doors factory which closed abruptly last week after Bank of America canceled the company's financing.  This is the first major organized factory occupation in the US by unionized workers since the 1930s and very likely the portent of further actions by workers as the capitalist system's house of cards continues to come crashing down.  The following account is by a member of the CHicago IWW.  Links to other news stories about the occupation are included as well:</em>
</p>
<p>
Fellow Workers,
</p>
<p>
I just got back from a Labor rally at Republic Windows, a factory located on Goose Island, which is a designated Manufacturing District in the City of Chicago, Illinois. There were approximately 200 Union people attending the rally, including 5 Wobblies, along with U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrrez, and the media, including Labor Beat (a Wob Member), all the Chicago TV stations, and probably Chicagoindymedia, Chicago Public Radio as well, can't confirm the last two.
</p>
<p>
The workers in the factory are members of UE Local 1110. The factory shut down at 10:00 am Friday. There was no
advanced notice to the workers. They have been denied vacation pay and severance pay, which under Illinois law is 75 days in a union shop. The workers refused to leave.They are currently occuping the factory. Apperently, BOA (Bank of America) wouldn't give Republic a Line of Credit to continue operations.
</p>
<p>
At the rally, representatives from Jobs With Justice, Interfaith Worker Justice (which co-ordinated the event), SEIU, Teamsters (the radical local), and US Rep Gutierezz spoke. Most of them had pretty good things to say.
Basically, Wall St has been Bailed Out, where's the bailout for Workers?
</p>
<p>
Illinois Rep Luis Gutierrezz threw his support behind the Republic Workers. He babbled on a bit, as is his nature. He is brokering a deal to meet with UE, BOA , and Republic Monday. The deal is: get the workers their severance and Holiday pay.
</p>
<p>
If the deal falls out, UE will picket BOA HQ at 135 S La Salle St. at Noon on Tuesday.
