<p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU670/EcologyCenter/iu670rally1.jpg" />Recyclers held a stop work rally to press contract demands on Thursday, November 8th, at recycling facilities in Berkeley.&nbsp; Thirty-five or so workers from two Berkeley recycling operations are in the midst of renegotiating contracts. At &ldquo;curbside&rdquo;, recycling trucks go out every week day morning to pick up residential recycling.&nbsp; Across the way at &ldquo;the Buyback,&rdquo; residential recycling from the trucks plus drop-off recycling is sorted by twenty workers.&nbsp; All workers are members of the IWW.&nbsp; Both union contracts expire on December 31st, 2007. &nbsp; During the rally workers from both shops stepped up and spoke about the need for unity, participation and solidarity in order to win their demands.&nbsp; Demands are not the same at both shops.&nbsp; However, workers at both shops are calling for a five dollar an hour wage increase across the board.&nbsp; This is a serious demand. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

<p><img width="245" height="248" border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU440/MetroLighting/6-Metro-workers.jpg" />Union workers at Metro Lighting are resuming picketing today as they strike over the company's unfair labor practices.&nbsp; One union worker was fired last week for both union organizing and raising concerns over workplace exposure to toxic chemicals.&nbsp; The other workers are striking over the company's repeated violations of federal and state labor law and are demanding that all union workers be allowed to return to work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fired worker Gabe W. describes the behavior of Metro Lighting owners Lawrence and Christa Grown: &quot;In the process of organizing, the boss made the environment very hostile. He would not negotiate on any terms and started retaliating from that point on. He hired union-busting attorneys, started harassing us at work and started surveillance of us. Our working conditions changed and the employee manual was re-written 3 or 4 times since we started organizing. New rules were made up, our hours were changed, our health care was cut.&quot;<br /><br />Metro Lighting workers have been organizing with the Industrial Workers of the World, or IWW, and are fighting for a sustainable wage for all workers, safe working conditions and an end to the age discrimination that has resulted in thousands of dollars in lost wages to one worker in his 60s.<br /><br />Metro Lighting owners have shown no willingness to negotiate with the union employees.&nbsp; In an attempt to crush the morale of the union workers, they locked them out for over three weeks and claimed to have closed the business due to a &quot;family emergency&quot;.&nbsp; The business was clearly open, however, as they were taking appointments through their website or over the phone and have had scabs working in both the retail store and workshop the whole time.<br /><br />Metro Lighting union workers are asking the community to come out and picket with them in solidarity this week and to let Metro Lighting know that Berkeley won't tolerate a business that is unfair to labor!<br /><br />For more information, contact Gabe at 510-395-1324.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
