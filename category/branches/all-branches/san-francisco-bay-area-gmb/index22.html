<p><img width="233" height="175" border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU630/Shattuck/DSC00143a.jpg" />BERKELEY 6:30 PM -- This afternoon workers at Landmark Shattuck Cinemas voted an outstanding 22 to 2 in favor of unionization. Despite new promises by Landmark and an attempt by CEO Bill Banowsky to thwart the union attempt, workers at the Shattuck say they've never really been worried about the vote.</p> <p>&quot;I've felt extremely confidant that the union would go through since the beginning.&quot; said Ryan Hatt, cinema employee age 21. &quot;Support has been almost unanimous since day one. There was no contest, if you would have asked me two months ago I could've guaranteed a landslide victory.&quot;</p> <p>Now that the vote has gone through, workers are looking ahead to the contract negotiation process. Contract negotiations at Kendall Square Cinemas in Cambridge, MA, the only other Landmark theatre to hold a union, have been moving extremely slowly with Landmark officials meeting only the bare minimum requirements to keep the negotiations process &quot;in good faith&quot; over the last year.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

<p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU630/Shattuck/Shattuck61406a.jpg" />Shattuck union workers brought their campaign for union recognition to the streets of Berkeley on Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp; About sixty people including many Shattuck workers gathered in front of the theatre to wave signs, hold banners, sing, shout play guitar and fiddle.&nbsp; The message was clear, &quot;we are union and we want changes now&quot;.&nbsp; Aurelaea River, a long time Shattuck Cinemas worker brought aong her electric violin and got the proceedings under way by playing a fast tune. Then Ryan from Riot Folk played guitar and sang to get the crowd together. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p> <p>Next came Ryan Hatt, one of the workers, to list what the workers demands are. A living wage, health care coverage, corporate accountibility, and respect.&nbsp; And a door chair.&nbsp; workers stand for long periods taking tickets.&nbsp; They had a chair but corpoate didn't approve.&nbsp; Chair gone.&nbsp; Then a meeting took place a couple of weeks back with the CEO.&nbsp; He came to explain what a union is.&nbsp; He wasn't quite sure what a union is after showing up an hour late. But the chair reappeared.&nbsp; Only to dissapear a few hours later.&nbsp; Rumor has it that management thought the union might claim the re issuance of the chair as a victory.&nbsp; The chair is stashed away for now.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

<p><strong>By x345292 - <em>Industrial Worker</em>, June 2006</strong></p> <p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU660/StnMtn/stonemountain1a.jpg" />After six months of preparation and negotiation eighteen workers at Stonemountain and Daughter Fabrics in Berkeley, California, ratified a renegotiated agreement with store owners Suzan and Bob Steinberg.</p> <p>The road to the final agreement was bumpy, twisting and fraught with peril. For example, a small group of workers tried to decertify the union. They worked steadily to build support among their coworkers. When they missed a legal window of opportunity (between 90 and 60 days prior to the expiration date of the contract) they red-baited and attempted other smear tactics.</p> <p>As with most retail business, Stonemountain hires mostly part time workers, pays low wages with no benefits and turn-over is high. The union has changed these conditions somewhat. Still, most of the workers who voted for the union in 2003 have left or were fired. By the time meetings began to discuss proposals for a new contract the shop was in disarray. One of the new workers, Holly, agreed to be shop delegate replacing Wayne, who was one of the original core of union organizers but needed a break. In the meantime several of the new hires had not been signed up. As time went on they formed the core of the anti-union workers. Included among them was a long-time employee who likes to play boss. In the middle were several workers who repeatedly shifted sides.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

The workers there have been in negotiations since July, Gill said.<br /><br />In addition to fair wages, Gill said the workers want a contract with a grievance procedure, which they do not have now. Landmarks Theaters did not return requests for comment. <br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
