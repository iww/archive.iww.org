</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 02/14/2006 - 9:27pm</p>
<p><em><u>Disclaimer</u> - The following article is reposted here because it is an issue with some relevance to the IWW. The views of the author do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.</em> </p><p><a target="_self" href="http://www.thestreetspirit.org/Feb2006/transit.htm"><strong>By Guillermo Mayer and Richard A. Marcantonio - <em>Street Spirit</em>, February 2006</strong></a></p><p><img width="262" height="164" border="1" align="right" alt="Youth organizers in Oakland protest being forced to choose between lunch and bus fare. Janny Castillo photo." src="../../../../graphics/IU540/muni/Rally.jpg" />When the late Rosa Parks protested an apartheid bus system 50 years ago, transit riders in Montgomery, Alabama, whether black or white, poor or well-off, all rode the same bus. Today's segregation, while less obvious, is in some ways more pernicious.<br /><br />Affluent whites have left urban bus systems the way most left New Orleans on the eve of Hurricane Katrina: in their cars. Of those who commute on public transit, most now ride deluxe rail systems, leaving people of color to rely on a second-class and deteriorating bus system.<br /><br />This is the scenario many low-income communities of color face in the San Francisco Bay Area, where substandard bus service operates as a &quot;separate and unequal&quot; transit system. Darensburg v. Metropolitan Transportation Commission, filed in April 2005 by East Bay bus riders and civil rights advocates against the region's transportation planning agency, challenges today's pervasive and insidious form of discrimination.<br /><br />The suit takes it name from Sylvia Darensburg, who lives transit inequity every day. An African-American mother of three living in East Oakland, Darensburg fights her way out of poverty by working days and attending college classes at night. Since she cannot afford to own a car, she is entirely dependent on public transit provided by the AC Transit bus system.<br /><br />In the 1970s, Darensburg remembers bus service that was reliable, cheap, and safe. Over the intervening decades, that system has spiraled downward. Inadequate bus service today severely limits Sylvia's access to many higher-paying jobs that are inaccessible by public transit. Even reaching jobs a few miles away in downtown Oakland is an arduous journey: She rides two buses with long waits for each, a trip that can take an hour each way.<br /><br />Getting to college classes can take even longer, due to the elimination of bus routes and evening service. And she must walk up to 12 blocks at night to get home from the nearest bus stop in her neighborhood. Even routine errands like grocery shopping are physically draining experiences. &quot;Every day, from the time I get up, I plan to get the bus,&quot; Darensburg says. &quot;This affects your physical health.&quot;<br />No more yellow school buses<br /><br />Since most school districts in the East Bay do not provide yellow school bus transportation, thousands of low-income youth also rely on the bus on a daily basis to get to and from school. On top of reliability, affordability is also an issue for many of these youth. In a recent survey of Oakland and Berkeley students, 61 percent said they skip lunch to pay for the bus ride home.<br /><br />The hardship and frustration that Darensburg and these youth face each day is shared by tens of thousands of low-income African American, Latino, and Asian residents, including seniors and people with disabilities, who rely on bus service provided by AC Transit. As California's largest bus-only operator, AC Transit provides service to many communities with high poverty rates, running buses from North Richmond through Oakland and into southern Alameda County.<br /><br />Nearly 80 percent of AC Transit's riders are people of color, and over 70 percent have incomes below $30,000. Nearly 60 percent are, like Darensburg, entirely transit dependent: They have no means of transportation other than public transit to get to essential destinations, such as jobs, school, grocery stores, and social services. Many of those who do have cars own older vehicles that they cannot afford to operate and maintain on a regular basis.<br /><br />Despite the urgent needs of AC Transit's overwhelmingly minority ridership, the region's transportation planning agency, Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), has continuously under-funded AC Transit over a period of decades, causing a precipitous decline in bus service and repeated fare hikes.<br /><br />MTC controls nearly $1 billion annually in federal and state transit dollars, and in turn controls the quantity and quality of public transit services available to communities throughout the region. Rather than prioritize the needs of its most vulnerable transit users, or even operate in accordance with basic principles of cost-effectiveness, MTC has favored costly rail expansions for Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Caltrain. These deluxe commuter rail systems, linking suburbs to major downtown business districts, serve riderships that are disproportionately white and affluent.<br />Discriminatory funding<br /><br />People of color make up two thirds, and whites, a third of all transit users in the Bay Area. But whites make up a disproportionate share of BART and Caltrain passengers: 43 percent and 60 percent, respectively. White rail riders also have significantly higher incomes than AC Transit bus riders: 75 percent of BART riders have incomes over $30,000, and 53 percent of Caltrain riders have incomes over $75,000. In addition, 80 percent of BART riders and 83 percent of Caltrain riders own private automobiles.<br /><br />Fully aware of these racial and income disparities, MTC gives rail riders a significantly greater public subsidy for each trip they take than it gives to AC Transit bus riders. AC Transit passengers receive a subsidy of public funds of $2.78 per trip. By contrast, BART riders receive more than double that -- $6.14 -- and Caltrain passengers receive $13.79, nearly five times more than a passenger of AC Transit. As a direct result, service levels on these commuter rail systems have reached an all-time high, while services continually decline, and fares rise, for AC Transit bus riders.<br /><br />East Bay communities and activists have repeatedly asked MTC to change its inequitable funding practices. In April 1998, Carl Anthony co-founder of Urban Habitat, along with 26 other organizational cosigners, wrote MTC to oppose the agency's proposed 1998 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). Questioning the mobility benefits that new highway projects would bring people of color, Anthony's letter urged MTC to conduct a comparative analysis to see how much of its $88 billion in funding would benefit high-income versus low-income communities, or whiter communities versus communities of color. MTC rebuffed the community's criticism and refused to perform the equity analysis requested by Anthony.<br />Stonewalling calls for justice<br /><br />In early 2001, a large group of African-American ministers in North Richmond wrote to MTC seeking equity in the funding between AC Transit and commuter rail services. The ministers pointed out that MTC itself had ranked an AC Transit bus project in the Richmond area of western Contra Costa County, with a population that is 69 percent minority, as the most cost-effective project considered in MTC's 2001 RTP. This bus initiative would have cost a mere $0.75 per new rider, and served an overwhelmingly low-income community of color.<br /><br />MTC refused to fund this project despite its small price tag. Instead, MTC devoted $2.3 billion to the least cost-effective projects: two commuter rail projects -- one for BART and the other for Caltrain -- both designed to serve disproportionately white, suburban populations, at a much higher cost per new rider.<br /><br />In adopting its 2001 Regional Transportation Plan, MTC again refused to conduct a comparative analysis of the disparity between the benefits its funding conferred on high-income, whiter transit riders, and those it conferred on low-income riders of color. Indeed, up to the present day, MTC has yet to conduct such an analysis.<br /><br />In November 2004, MTC was asked to perform just that kind of analysis by its Minority Citizens' Advisory Committee (MCAC), which adopted a set of simple environmental justice principles. These principles asked MTC to &quot;[c]ollect accurate and current data essential to understanding the presence and extent of inequities in transportation funding based on race and income,&quot; and to &quot;change its investment decisions as necessary to mitigate identified inequities.&quot;<br /><br />MTC has so far failed to adopt, much less implement, these guiding principles. To the contrary, it repeatedly attempted to stonewall MCAC's efforts by contending that the principles wrongly presumed that inequities existed, and that further study was required &quot;to define 'inequity.'&quot; At the same time, it aggressively lobbied MCAC to water down its recommendations.<br /><br />In April 2005, AC Transit bus riders of color, in coalition with civil rights and labor groups, filed the Darensburg action in federal court. The suit, brought as a class action on behalf of all current and future AC Transit riders of color, seeks to end MTC's racially discriminatory funding practices. The suit alleges that MTC violates federal and state civil rights laws by channeling funds to benefit predominantly white rail riders at the expense of AC Transit bus riders of color.<br /><br />In addition to plaintiff Sylvia Darensburg, Vivian Hain from East Oakland, and Virginia Martinez from Richmond are individually named plaintiffs. Two organizational plaintiffs have also joined the suit: Communities for a Better Environment (CBE) and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 192.<br /><br />The Darensburg lawsuit is an important tool in the long struggle for equity in Bay Area transportation funding. But that long community struggle demonstrates the essential role that a sustainable grassroots constituency must play in any long-term solution.<br /><br />The Bay Area must draw lessons from the Los Angeles Bus Riders Union's (LA BRU) involvement in winning and implementing their lawsuit against the L.A. Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). After a two-year legal fight, the LA BRU obtained a consent decree in 1996 obligating the MTA to reduce overcrowding on buses, maintain equitable fares between bus and rail, and create a multi-year New Service plan to eliminate transit segregation in Los Angeles.<br /><br />But this historic legal victory did not stop MTA from aggressively resisting change. The agency fought the consent decree up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and stubbornly pursued its costly rail projects while simultaneously implementing new rounds of service cuts for bus routes.<br /><br />MTA's aggressive tactics have been thwarted thus far by a highly organized and committed constituency of low-income and minority bus riders who have engaged in massive protests, direct action, and civil disobedience, as well as careful research, analysis and monitoring, to vindicate their legal rights.<br /><br />Their determined effort has ensured that this legal victory bore concrete results: Since 1994, LA BRU, a force of 3,000 dues-paying bus riders, has secured over 2,000 compressed natural gas (CNG) replacement buses, more than 300 new CNG expansion buses, restored Night Owl service from midnight to 5 a.m., and reduced the price for bus passes and fares.<br /><br />The victorious Bus Riders Union campaign illustrates that bus riders know better than anyone else what inadequacies they are facing, and are best suited to monitor conditions, set priorities, and apply political pressure to hold public agencies accountable. Like the MTA lawsuit, the ultimate success of the Darensburg case will largely depend on the participation of a sustainable grassroots constituency of bus riders.<br />Lessons of Montgomery boycott<br /><br />Bay Area transit advocates must also draw on the lessons from Montgomery, Alabama. When NAACP lawyers challenging Jim Crow laws brought suit, they acted in a context created by the mobilization of large numbers of people in boycotts, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience. In these earlier struggles, legal strategies were tied to a broad range of other strategies that were primarily spearheaded, not by lawyers, but by organized communities.<br /><br />The success of litigation strategies, both in the immediate sense of prevailing in court and in the broader sense of achieving progressive structural change, has always depended on a close link between legal tactics and community mobilization. In instances where inequity is so deeply ingrained and insulated from democratic participation, litigation is often an essential tool to initiate change.<br /><br />But it is organized constituencies that both create the possibility of change and ensure that legal victories are implemented effectively. That is the case today in the East Bay, no less than it was 50 years ago in Montgomery, Alabama. To achieve transportation justice in the Bay Area, we will need the same sort of grassroots coalitions and coordination that were created in 1955.<br /><br /><em>Reprinted from Race, Poverty and the Environent, a journal of social and environmental justice published by Urban Habitat, <a target="_self" href="http://www.urbanhabitat.org/">www.urbanhabitat.org</a> Guillermo Mayer is an attorney fellow, and Richard Marcantonio is a managing attorney, with the public interest law firm of Public Advocates, Inc., in San Francisco.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 01/10/2006 - 1:51am</p>
<p><strong>December 22nd:</strong> Last Thursday at 7 in the morning, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents with guns busted into the San Francisco apartment of two Young Workers United (YWU) members. The couple was excitedly preparing for the birth of their first child. It appears to be the case that the womanÂ’s former employers called the ICE on this young family. Due to legal considerations, YWU is not releasing the name the couple or the restaurant. Her employer had been paying far below the legal minimum wage, and also yelled at workers, threatened them with deportation, called them racial slurs and ultimately fired the young woman for speaking out and organizing against these abuses and being pregnant. <br /><br /> The young man was taken away and flown that night to a detention center in Eloy, Arizona. It is virtually impossible to get into the detention center and 90% of the detainees have no access to a lawyer. YWU is working tirelessly to coordinate with lawyers and Arizona immigrant rights group to get the all the resources he needs. A recent doctor's appointment indicates that the young woman will likely give birth this week. YWU has helped win a minimum wage charge through the City and has claims for pregnancy discrimination and retaliation. This young mother-to-be has no income since the ICE is detaining her partner. Young Workers United is asking for donations to be sent to help with her expenses.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <em>Update:&nbsp; The father is still in custody in Eli, Nevada.&nbsp; He has a lawyer and support from Young Workers United and the local labor and immigrants' rights communities.&nbsp; An attempt to post bail at his hearing on January 3rd was ignored by the judge.<br /> </em> </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 11/23/2005 - 6:07am</p>
<p><em>Members of the Bay Area The IWW participated in and played a significant role in the Neptune Jade soildarity actions in 1997.&nbsp; A detailed history of that struggle is documented here:</em> <a href="../../../../unions/iu510/jade/index/" target="_blank">http://www.iww.org/unions/iu510/jade/</a></p><hr /><p><strong>By Steve Zeltser&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img width="214" height="306" border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU510/work/neptunejade.jpg" />ONCE AGAIN DOCKWORKERS FROM around the world met in Liverpool Sept. 23-24 &mdash; this time not to co-ordinate solidarity actions for the Liverpool dockers, but to recognize those unions that participated in the worldwide actions and learned the lessons of that struggle in preparation for future waterfront battles. <br /> Liverpool Dockers <br /><br /> The Liverpool struggle began 10 years ago when young dockworkers spontaneously set up a picket line over substandard conditions and other union members of the Transport and General Workers Union honored their picket line, as they had always done. <br /><br /> All 500 dockers were sacked by the employer, Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. <br /><br /> Starting the weekend&rsquo;s main event, Liverpool dock steward Jimmy Nolan opened by reminding participants that the gathering was not a celebration because the dockworkers did not win their struggle. Rather it was a commemoration of a struggle that reignited militancy and underscored the necessity of international workers&rsquo; solidarity in today&rsquo;s global economy. <br /><br /> In the heat of the Liverpool battle, maritime unions around the world awakened to their call from Europe to Japan, from the United States and Canada to Australia and New Zealand. <br /><br /> In the end the Liverpool dockers lost because they couldn&rsquo;t mobilize mass picketing on the Mersey docks to stop scabbing. That key element of solidarity was betrayed by the lack of support of their own union, the Transport and General Workers Union, the Trade Union Congress and British Prime Minister Tony Blair&rsquo;s so-called New Labour Party. <br /><br /> Bob Crow, General Secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers Union (RMT) (whose union has recently been purged from the New Labour Party for its militancy and its opposition to the war in Iraq) fired up the crowd when he cited the illegal strike action by Gate Gourmet workers &ndash; mainly South Asian women &ndash; earlier that month. Their action sparked an unofficial strike by baggage handlers that grounded all flights of British Airways at Heathrow Airport. <br /><br /> He condemned the banning of solidarity actions by Thatcher&rsquo;s anti-union legislation and left intact by Blair&rsquo;s New Labour Party. To rousing applause Crow asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;secondary&rsquo; action? Surely that&rsquo;s what the trade union movement is based on.&rdquo; <br /><br /> One of the first speakers was ILWU International President Jim Spinosa, who headed a delegation of 15 members and officers. He reminded the audience that the Liverpool dockers&rsquo; struggle had inspired longshore workers to network and to organize solidarity actions: first, the Neptune Jade in Oakland in support of the Liverpool dockers, then the Columbus Canada in Los Angeles in support of the Australian wharfies, then actions in defense of the Charleston longshoremen and most recently the bloody police assault on dockworker union president Jorge Silva Baron in Iquique, Chile. <br /><br /> Spinosa noted what dockworkers have been learning in this era of international capitalism. <br /><br /> &ldquo;We have to understand how the employers have been able to mobilize and get an upper hand in globalization,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They project out 10, 15, 20 years. We working people are now doing the same thing, hooking up with organizations and networking around the world in solidarity. We are closing the world tighter and tighter so we can put together actions much quicker than we did for the Liverpool situation.&rdquo; <br /><br /> Receiving a warm applause for his open and honest appraisal, Frank Leys, Secretary of the ITF Dockers Section, acknowledged that mistakes were made by his five million-strong organization during the Liverpool dispute. <br /><br /> The Transport and General Workers Union never supported the strike, making it unofficial and thereby illegal. Since the TGWU was an ITF affiliate, the ITF didn&rsquo;t support the dockers either. <br /><br /> &ldquo;Staying silent has never brought the workers forward,&rdquo; Leys said. &ldquo;Mistakes of the past will be remembered in order to avoid repeating them.&rdquo; <br /><br /> He exhorted all dockworkers to unify now in order to fight and defeat the European Unions&rsquo; Port Directive on &ldquo;selfhandling&rdquo; that would allow ships&rsquo; crews to do longshore work in port. If implemented in Europe, this union-busting move will be repeated in all the world&rsquo;s ports. <br /><br /> Ken Riley, president of the ILA Charleston longshore Local 1422, recounted how their contract struggle with Nordana Lines in 2000 and the subsequent Charleston 5 defense campaign was ultimately successful because of ILWU&rsquo;s international dockworker links, especially the Coordinadora of Spain, that were brought into play. These bonds were forged at international conferences in support of the Liverpool dockers. <br /><br /> In the tradition of Harry Bridges&rsquo; good Aussie friend Tas Bull, Paddy Crumlin, National Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) spoke poignantly about the practical reality of the state of trade unions and of class struggle globally. He praised the Liverpool dockworkers for their courageous struggle and criticized Bill Morris, then-General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, for not supporting the strike. <br /><br /> &ldquo;The ITF should have played a stronger role, no matter how difficult, in making sure it was a win not a loss,&rdquo; Crumlin said, agreeing with the ITF&rsquo;s Leys. <br /><br /> He said now the movement has &ldquo;the experience to go forward&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve learned the lesson from the Liverpool struggle: unions must organize properly, supporting rank-and-file workers on the job, and organize globally.&rdquo; <br /><br /> As an example, Crumlin cited the ILWU&rsquo;s solidarity action during the MUA strike. The Columbus Canada had been loaded by scabs in Australia and because of the labor-community picket in the port of Los Angeles, the ship was forced to return to Australia to be loaded by union wharfies before it would be discharged on the U.S. West Coast. <br /><br /> He pointed out that dockworkers&rsquo; unions are being targeted by maritime employers and the governments because of their progressive stands, including dock protests against wars like in Vietnam and Iraq. <br /><br /> &ldquo;They are systematically taking us on because we are a threat to what they are doing to our societies and our global market, and I&rsquo;m proud of that,&ldquo; Crumlin said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve identified the enemy and most of us here have looked the devil in the eye and we find if we are prepared to stick together and work together, the devil always blinks.&rdquo; <br /> Solidarity Has No Borders: the Journey of the Neptune Jade <br /> Available from the producer: <br /> Labor Video Project <br /> P.O.

It enabled the stewards to keep the dockworkers together. <br /><br /> Like a ripple in the water, it reawakened workers&rsquo; awareness of the importance of international solidarity and became the model for other solidarity actions that followed, like the 1998 boycott of the Columbus Canada in Los Angeles in support of the Australian wharfies and the action by the Spanish dockers against the Nordana shipping line in support of the Charleston Five longshore workers. <br /><br /> Since previous arbitration hearings restricted the employer group, the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), from retrieving its losses due to industrial actions from the ILWU, the PMA moved to sue the individuals who were on the picket line for the financial hit its member companies claimed they took because of the picket. <br /><br /> The PMA subpoenaed documents with information about individuals who were from the ILWU International, The Dispatcher, and Locals 10 and 34. Eventually PMA hauled then-International President Brian McWilliams and Dispatcher editor Steve Stallone into court, seeking to have them found in contempt of court and thrown in jail if they continued to refuse to turn snitch. <br /><br /> The ILWU won that case based on a ruling that found that The Dispatcher as a newspaper had a First Amendment right to gather information without the interference or intrusion of the government. <br /><br /> In pre-trial motions the charges against two of the three named defendants &ndash; Local 10 activist Jack Heyman and the Golden Gate chapter of the Labor Party &ndash; were thrown out and the court restricted PMA to suing only those it allegedly had evidence committed illegal acts on the picket line. <br /><br /> But the court allowed PMA to continue to pursue picket captain and IBU member Robert Irminger and try to force him to name others on the line. <br /><br /> After Bay Area longshore locals shut down the Port of Oakland July 22, rallied in front of the PMA&rsquo;s Oakland office and marched 1,000 strong to the courthouse demanding the charges be dropped &mdash; and the Coast Committee threatening coastwise action if PMA carried out the prosecution of Irminger &mdash; the employers gave in. <br /><br /> Following the video showing, Steve Zeltzer of the Labor Video Project chaired the event with Irminger and Heyman speaking, followed by discussion. <br /><br /> Irminger chronicled how the Neptune Jade sailed into the port of Oakland Sept. 28, 1997 from Thamesport, England. The port was operated by Mersey Docks and Harbor Company &ndash; which had sacked the 500 Liverpool dockers. It was the second anniversary of the strike. Labor and community activists set up a picket line in solidarity with the Liverpool dockers. At this 10th anniversary commemoration in Liverpool, steward Terry Teague presented Irminger with a plaque for his dedication to the struggle. <br /><br /> For three-and-a-half days longshore workers refused to cross the picket line, despite a court injunction ordering them to do so. Finally, the Neptune Jade, desperate to unload its cargo in a U. S. West Coast port but finding no safe haven, departed for Vancouver, Canada, another ILWU port. <br /><br /> Labor activists across the border also set up a picket, forcing the Neptune Jade to sail for Japan. There Japanese dockworkers &ndash; well aware of the hot cargo on board &ndash; didn&rsquo;t touch the ship in two ports. Finally the ship sailed to Taiwan where the cargo was discharged and the Neptune Jade, now internationally notorious, was renamed. <br /><br /> Such power of coordinated action by workers in three different countries sent shivers down the spine of maritime companies around the globe. The website of the Neptune Jade Defense Committee was swamped by visits from global corporations fearful of the specter of labor solidarity. <br /><br /> At the Longshore Caucus held after the ILWU Convention in Portland in 2000, attorney Rob Remar (who was instrumental in helping to pilot the Neptune Jade campaign through legal channels) explained that we live in a country with repressive anti-labor legislation like the Taft-Hartley Act which makes solidarity actions, or as employers say, &ldquo;secondary boycotts,&rdquo; difficult for unions to organize. &ldquo;The significance of the Neptune Jade action lay in the fact that the ILWU was able to implement its policy of support for their Liverpool brothers while defending itself against legal attacks,&amp;#rdquo; he said. <br /><br /> At the Liverpool gathering, Irminger pointed out how the Neptune Jade action influenced later events. &ldquo;It was the Neptune Jade action which strengthened the links between Bay Area organized labor and community groups, preceding and laying the basis for a global justice movement here,&rdquo; he said. <br /><br /> In 1999, he pointed out, ILWU and other trade unionists marched with young protesters demonstrating against the World Trade Organization in Seattle. And again, in 2001, global justice activists successfully picketed an Italian ship in the Port of Oakland to protest the killing of a young anti-capitalist globalization protester in Genoa. <br /><br /> Jack Heyman, who had been sent to Liverpool by then-ILWU President Brian McWilliams early in their struggle in 1996, drew a direct connection from Liverpool to the Neptune Jade to the ILWU&rsquo;s contentious 2002 contract negotiations and the anti-Iraq War protests. When the Pacific Maritime Association and the Bush administration threatened the ILWU during the 2002 contract negotiations, he said, these activists and dockworkers internationally were readily mobilized to support the ILWU &mdash; from marches and rallies in San Francisco to parrying with right-wing politicians in the Australian press. <br /><br /> Heyman said when anti-war activists demonstrated in the Port of Oakland at the start of the Iraq War, longshore workers refused to cross their picket lines as they had done six years earlier in the Neptune Jade picket line. One difference, he noted, was that Oakland mayor Jerry Brown himself participated in the Neptune Jade picket, but he now supports the blood police repression of the anti-war demonstration. <br /><br /> The veil of 9/11 &ldquo;national security,&rdquo; had been used by the government to cover the peaceful protesters as &ldquo;terrorists.&rdquo; Scores were shot with so-called less-than-lethal weapons including nine longshore workers. Business Agent Heyman was arrested for trying to protect his members against the police assault. Although the port was not shut down, the case against the police, ILWU Local 10 v City of Oakland, is scheduled for court in January 2006. <br /><br /> </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

<p><u>Disclaimer</u><em> - The following article is reposted here because it is an issue with some relevance to the IWW. The views of the author do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.&nbsp; This article is somewhat dated, but still relevant.<br /> </em></p> <p><strong> By Tom Wetzel</strong> </p> <p><img border="0" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU540/muni/transit_social_strike_circl.jpg" />Despite heavy police presence at major bus transfer points, at least a couple thousand passengers rode the buses for free in San Francisco on Thursday, September 1st &mdash; the opening day of a fare strike in North America's most bus-intensive city. In the days leading up to September 1st, more than 50 people were actively organizing for the fare strike, with new groups endorsing the effort in the last week. More than 20,000 leaflets had been distributed and 10,000 stickers were attached to bus shelters and poles throughout the city &mdash; in Spanish and Chinese as well as English. </p> <p> Muni &mdash; San Francisco's city-owned bus and streetcar network &mdash; raised its adult cash fare to $1.50 as of September 1st. This is the second hike in two years, representing an increase of 50 percent since 2003. Although organized pressure from community groups forced Muni management to back down on a proposal to raise the monthly pass, many low-income people have a hard time getting together the cash to buy the monthly pass. The weekly pass was a more financially accessible discount option for them. Muni never adequately advertised the weekly pass and has now raised it from $12 to $15. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
