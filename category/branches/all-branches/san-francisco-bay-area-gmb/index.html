</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:47pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Bay Area IWW - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-iww-recycling-workers-walk-off-job-over-unpaid-wages/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, August 24, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/12-1068x711.jpg" width="320" height="213" align="right" alt="" />Workers at Buyback, a recycling centre in Berkeley, have walked off the job this morning after the payment of their wages was delayed without explanation.</p>
<p>The workers, who are members of the Industrial Workers of the World, discovered at the start of their shift that none of them had received their scheduled payment for the previous fortnight&rsquo;s work, which was due to come through earlier this morning.</p>
<p>This the third occasion this year that wages have not been paid on time &ndash; something that can cause extensive problems for the finances of workers and their families. After turning up at 8 AM this morning and being offered no explanation from management for the error, Buyback workers held a union meeting and voted 18-0 to immediately walk out.</p>
<p>Buyback workers have already struck twice this year &ndash; the first an unannounced half-day walkout during the February 16 &lsquo;Day Without Immigrants,&rsquo; and the second a two-hour stoppage to hold a celebratory barbecue on May 1.</p>
<p>Workers have not yet returned to work and it&rsquo;s unclear at this stage whether the action will continue into tomorrow.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/mtw-local9_0.gif" alt="" width="320" height="513" align="right" />For May Day 2017 Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union invoked a contractual &quot;stop-work&quot; privilege and refused to work any Bay Area docks in celebration of International Workers Day for the third consecutive year. This speech, originally delivered at the 75th Anniversary of the 1934 San Francisco General Strike at the Marine Firemen&rsquo;s Hall in San Francisco, was adapted for the rally preceding the May Day march on May 1, 2017.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, when he was a North Beach resident, poet Allen Ginsberg shipped out various times with the merchant marines from the Embarcadero. Earlier, the proximity of the waterfront to the vibrant intellectual life of the bohemians and political radicals of North Beach made San Francisco the most radical port city in the U.S. But Ginsberg lived in North Beach during the height of the Cold War, so perhaps it should be expected that his poem &ldquo;America&rdquo; has the line:</p>

<p>Poet Kenneth Rexroth, who was close to the circle of anarchists and anti-World War II pacifists who founded KPFA in 1949, and earlier had been a soapboxer and wrote for the <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfront Worker</span>, said this about the pre-World War II period:</p>
<div class="bb-quote"><b>Kenneth Rexroth wrote:</b><br />

The interesting thing is that most of them became practical labor organizers, rather than Bohemians sitting around Union Square arguing about proletarian literature . . . You see, all of us were very actively involved and this makes all the difference in the world. Another thing, very few of these people were orthodox Commies because the basic tradition on the West Coast was IWW.</blockquote></div>
<p>From the California Gold Rush onwards, a worker on the West Coast could easily go out and get a job in the woods or at sea or in the fields.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://ecology.iww.org/images/Trump-Protest1.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="220" align="right" />WHEREAS, </strong>the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States has sparked fear and anger in our community, especially among those most marginalized, including immigrants, Muslims, people of color, women, the disabled, and LGBTQ populations.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the President Elect has publicly supported and endorsed anti-union policies including federal Right to Work laws and is considering appointing to his cabinet people with a track record of promoting such policies</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, newly appointed Supreme Court Justices will swing the court to be more consistently anti-union</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the privatization of Social Security and Medicare is likely to be pushed early in the Trump administration</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the diverse membership of the working class and of our unions includes populations that candidate Trump threatened with bigoted policies and hateful rhetoric</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, that hateful rhetoric has already been seen in the form of an increase of hate crimes and violence against marginalized communities which overlap with our membership</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Resolution in Protest of the Inauguration of President Donald Trump, spontaneous demonstrations have erupted across the country immediately following the election of Donald Trump. Many organizations of students, labor, women, and various communities are continuing to plan massive protests including on Martin Luther King, Jr Day and culminating in action on the day of the inauguration of Donald Trump, January 20, 2017</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the day on which we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr who fought against racism and bigotry and championed the issues of the working class is just four days before the inauguration of Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the power of organized labor is not reliant upon the occupant of any government office up to and including the office of President of the United States</p>
<p><strong>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED</strong>, that the IWW Bay Area General Membership Branch endorses and encourages all members to participate in the nationwide call for protest and actions beginning with those honoring and continuing the struggle of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr on his day, Monday, January 16 and culminating in a national day of action and protest and a reassertion of the power of organized labor on Friday January, 20, the day of the Inauguration of President Donald Trump</p>

</em></p>
<p><img width="320" height="251" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/HotelFrank1.jpg" alt="" />Almost five years after I was illegally fired from my job as a bellman at Hotel Frank, the current owners of the Union Square hotel at Geary and Mason (now called Hotel G) are telling guests that there is no luggage service, that if they want to get their bags to or from their rooms they are on their own, and that if they want to store their luggage there is a roped-off area in the lobby where they can dump their bags, without any guarantee that they will be there when they want to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Hotel management recently instituted this goofy practice in order to keep me from coming back to work at the hotel.&nbsp; Quite a backhanded complement to my perceived organizing and troublemaking ability, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Here is an email that Matthew Rubenstein, the Associate Sales &amp; Social Media Manager at Hotel G, sent to a potential guest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do have a place in the lobby where you can store the luggage &ndash; it is a roped-off area by the front desk.&nbsp; Unfortunately we cannot transport the bags up to the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this, also from Mr. Rubenstein, responding to a question about the security of the &ldquo;roped-off area&rdquo; in the lobby:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, if it were me I would be fine leaving anything outside of laptops/cameras etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a photo of the &ldquo;roped-off area&rdquo; in the lobby.&nbsp; Note that there is a woman, presumably a hotel guest, going through some of the stored luggage:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/HotelFrank2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Note that the luggage is blocking a doorway.&nbsp; That is the door to the stairs from the basement, where the housekeeping office and the employee break room are located.&nbsp; With this door blocked, the only access to the basement is via the elevator.&nbsp; I wonder what the Fire Marshal might think of this.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/21/2015 - 6:18pm</p>
<p><b>By Ron Kaminkow - <a href="http://labornotes.org/blogs/2015/01/rail-workers-and-environmentalists-teach-each-other" target="_blank"><em>Labor Notes</em></a>, January 21, 2015 </b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW (or even the IWW&rsquo;s EUC) and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s. Several IWW branches have, however, endorsed this effort.<br />
</em></p>
<p><img width="320" height="239" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/BombTrainBuffett1.jpg" alt="" />With public attention focused on the railroads in a way it hasn&rsquo;t been for decades, the cross-craft solidarity group Railroad Workers United is seizing the opportunity to teach the general public &ldquo;railroading 101&rdquo;&mdash;and teach rail workers &ldquo;environmental politics 101.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both those workshops, among others, will be offered at one-day conferences on &ldquo;The Future of Railroads: Safety, Workers, Community, and Environment,&rdquo; March 14 in Richmond, California, and March 21 in Olympia, Washington. (See below) for details.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;My excitement about the conference is having railroaders, who on a daily basis are moving these really dangerous, volatile, flammable materials, having a dialogue with communities who want it to be made safe,&rdquo; says activist Gifford Hartman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my knowledge it&rsquo;s never been done,&rdquo; says Seattle switchman-conductor Jen Wallis. &ldquo;Rail labor hasn&rsquo;t worked with environmentalists to the degree that steelworkers and longshoremen and Teamsters have. It&rsquo;s all very new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RWU is partnering with the Backbone Campaign and other groups to organize both events. The idea is to bring together rank-and-filers, environmentalists, and the general public.</p>
<p>Just as important as learning each other&rsquo;s issues, Wallis says, is that &ldquo;we get to know each other&hellip; So we have people we can call on when we have an issue on the table, and they can do the same with us.&rdquo;</p>
