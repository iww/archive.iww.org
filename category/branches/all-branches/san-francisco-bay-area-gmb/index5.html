<a href="../../../../node/5149/" rel="bookmark">Bay Area Industrial Workers of the World Statement in Support of Justice for Oscar Grant and Oct 23rd Oakland Labor Rally</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 08/07/2010 - 2:53am</p>
<p><b>The following Resolution was adopted by a unanimous voice vote at its August 2010 General Membership Branch Meeting held Thursday, August 5, 2010:</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/anarchism/police_brutality01.gif" align="right" border=1 height=146 width=211 />[Begin]</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) acknowledge that police violence is a tragic yet common occurrence in working class communities and for people of color. A notable example took place January 1, 2009, when BART police officer Johannes Mehserle brutality shot and killed 22-year-old Oscar Grant without justification. Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and will be sentenced November 5, 2010.</p>
<p>The IWW firmly rejects police violence and stands beside the family and friends of Oscar Grant. In recognizing that ‘an injury to one is an injury to all’ the IWW is in solidarity with organized labor and members of the Bay Area community who seek justice for Oscar Grant and jail for Johannes Mehserle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the IWW strongly supports the planned demonstration by labor and community groups Saturday October 23, 2010 at Oakland City Hall and joins in the call to ‘jail killer cops.’</p>
<p>[End]</p>
<p><u>Note:</u> The original call out was made by ILWU Local 10,
AFL-CIO</p>

<p>
Thursday March 4th was an exciting and invigorating day of action as students and education workers from around the State of California walked out of schools and universities in protest of impending cuts to education budgets statewide. Students and teachers protested against the cutbacks, attacks on unions, and even against the systematic privatization of public education.
</p>
<p>
On March 4th the IWW set up a literature table at Frank Ogawa Plaza just outside of city Hall in downtown Oakland, which was the gathering point for students and teachers in western Alameda County. Beginning at Noon, thousands of teachers and students began pouring into the plaza as organizers, activists, students, and teachers spoke out against the impending cuts. IWW members marched in several different contingents (and many active members of the Bay Area GMB are teachers).
</p>
<p>
Bay Area IWW buyback recyclers spoke out publicly against the cutbacks in solidartity with the students and teachers. The largest contingent to arrive in Ogawal plaza (and one of the last) was the 1,000-plus strong UC Berkeley contingent who marched over six miles from the Berkeley campus to downtown Oakland.
</p>
<p>
Some of the IWW members later took BART (public transit) across the bay to San Francisco to join in a rally at Civic Center Plaza organized by teachers and students in the city.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, some of the more militant activists made a bold stand by taking over a very busy Interstate 880 and 980 freeway interchange near Oakland's Jack London Square. It's not certain whether or not any of these activists were IWW members, several of the demonstrators were arrested (and one unlucky activist was injured by a fall from the above-ground freeway overpass to the street level below).&quot;

<a href="../../../../node/5010/" rel="bookmark">“Springtime for America (Again)” - Bay Area IWW Participates in the March 4th Demonstrations</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 03/23/2010 - 2:06pm</p>
<p>

<strong>By John Reimann<br />
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Ronald Reagan ran for re-election for president in
1984, he declared that it was “springtime for America”. He should have said it
was “springtime for Corporate America.” Under his administration and those that
followed, Corporate America and the world wide capitalist class increased its
domination of the world, seemingly without an equivalent resistance from the
working class, especially from the US working class. While this has
started to change in recent years, the movement in the US has been
lagging far behind.
</p>
<p>
Now that is starting to change.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Youth Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
In California,
a college and university student movement started over the last six months. The
attacks on college and university students that have generated this movement
are part of wider attacks on public education as well as on all public services
and on the working class in general. Almost immediately, the university
students grasped the slogan “defend free public education” – making the link
between their own situation and that of public education in general. At a California state-wide
student conference last October, it was agreed to organize a state-wide strike
for March 4.
</p>
<p>
Here in the working class town of Oakland,
California,
an “Outreach Committee” was set up build the movement in this area. One key
issue was decided immediately: Our intent was to actually disrupt the workings
of the state, and we were going to try to do that through setting up a protest
starting at noon, rather than at the end of the work day. We also wanted this
to be an event of, by and for the youth of Oakland.
</p>
<p>
This contrasted to San
Francisco, where the union officialdom conspired with
the Board of Education to block a day-time rally. There, they organized a rally
for 5:00 p.m. to ensure that workers didn’t walk off work and students didn’t
walk out of school. Throughout the region, those forces who sought to tame the
movement pushed for attendance at this San Francisco
rally rather than the one in Oakland.
</p>
<p>
A key focus in Oakland
was to organize in the high schools. However, the size of our effort was
limited by the extreme constraints on our actual forces and resources. As a
result, in most schools we were unable to establish regular working groups to
organize a strike. Yet on March 4, by 7:30 in the morning, there were some 30
or 40 students standing outside the high school near my home, with home-made
picket signs in hand, shouting and cheering. <em>With just the minimal outside help, these students had organized
themselves!</em>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 01/19/2010 - 1:48pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU670/EcologyCenter/iu670rally1.jpg" align="right" />The IWW is engaged in contract discussions with the Ecology Center, which runs Curbside Recycling - the outfit that picks up recyclable trash in Berkeley. They have presented a series of demands for draconian cut backs.<br />
<br />
This includes demanding that the workers pay 20% of the cost of their health insurance premiums. Their position is that everywhere else such cuts are being instituted and they have to do the same. Our position is that these cuts have to be stopped somewhere, or, to paraphrase Harry Truman, &quot;the cuts stop here.&quot; At the same time, Buyback - the recycling yard that is on the same property as Curbside and also under IWW contract - has announced that they will be laying off a worker, a first there.<br />
<br />
The IWW is holding a &quot;safety meeting&quot; rally to protest these twin events. This will be in their yard at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 21. The yard is on 2nd Street, just north of Gillman in north Berkeley (near the freeway).<br />
<br />
We are urging all  union members and supporters, students and community members to participate.<br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
