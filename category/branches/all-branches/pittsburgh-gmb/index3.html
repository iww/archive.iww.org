<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 07/10/2006 - 3:33am</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU460/EEFC/iwweefc.jpg" align="right" /><strong>PITTSBURGH, PA</strong>&mdash;A clear majority of workers have chosen union representation at the East End Food Co-op, Pittsburgh&rsquo;s only member-owned natural and organic food market.&nbsp; The East End Food Co-op Workers Committee, affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), held an independent union authorization card count after their employer refused to accept the workers&rsquo; signed cards as democratic proof of union support.&nbsp; The Thomas Merton Center, a well-known and respected peace and social justice organization since 1972, facilitated the card count and verified the results on July 6, 2006. <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />On behalf of the Thomas Merton Center, Board member Michelle Burton Brown stated in a written declaration of confirmation, &ldquo;The East End Food Co-op Workers Committee, an affiliate of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), has obtained a clear majority of workers who wish to have the IWW serve as their exclusive bargaining agent for the purposes of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement covering wages, hours, and all other terms and conditions of employment with their employer, the East End Food Co-op.&rdquo;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with these results,&rdquo; said Hope Anne Nathan, a Co-op worker.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked really hard to reach out to all of our co-workers and discuss the union so they could make an informed decision.&nbsp; Workers&rsquo; support for the union was obvious to us.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ve clearly proved it with a neutral, third-party counting the cards and recognizing the Workers Committee as the bargaining agent.&rdquo;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Evan W. Wolfson, another Co-op employee said, &ldquo;The law doesn&rsquo;t yet compel employers to accept the results of an authorization card-count, but we&rsquo;re certain that most Co-op&rsquo;s shoppers and advertisers understand what happens when workers feel disrespected and voiceless.&nbsp; The quality of the Co-op is going to suffer if management doesn&rsquo;t start listening to their employees.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The Workers Committee began its organizing drive with the IWW on May 15, 2006 to improve working conditions, pay and benefits, and to address long-standing issues of low staff morale and high turnover.&nbsp; The Co-op employs approximately 50 workers who would be covered by a labor contract should the union prevail in its quest for legal bargaining rights.&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />At the June 26th meeting of the Co-op Board of Directors, the Board and General Manager heard several testimonials from employees and Co-op members overwhelmingly in favor of unionization and the card-check process.&nbsp; Without making a statement either for or against the union, the Board abruptly departed from it previous practice of dealing with the union and delegated authority and control over union matters to the store&rsquo;s General Manager.&nbsp; Since then, management has disavowed the card-check process in favor of a secretive ballot election and has hired Braun Consulting Group, based in Seattle, Washington &ndash; a known union-avoidance firm with experience in dealing with union campaigns at consumer co-operatives. <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><span class="redbar">Contact: </span><br />Stacey Clampitt - East End Food Co-op Workers Committee </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_244 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Pittsburgh General Membership Branch.

<p class="heading">Note: <em>This is an official Pittsburgh GMB posting.&nbsp; The Branch only authorizes officially recognized news and articles to be posted under the Pittsburgh GMB banner.</em></p><p class="heading">One Hundred Years of Radical Solidarity</p><p class="heading">By FW Kevin Farkas, originally published&nbsp;<em>Thursday</em><em>, Sep. 15, 2005</em><br /><a href="mailto:kjfarkas_aft@yahoo.com">kjfarkas_aft@yahoo.com</a> <br /></p><blockquote>This year the Industrial Workers of the World celebrates its 100th anniversary. With historic and contemporary ties to Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, the IWW is one of the earliest labor organizations to advocate industrial unionism. In 1909, 1912, and 1913 the Wobblies organized strikes with local workers in the steel and tobacco industries. The Pittsburgh General Membership Branch of the IWW will be holding a Centenary celebration in October to commemorate one hundred years of radical solidarity unionism.</blockquote><p class="article">It sounds like today...the bulk of the American working class is unorganized. Workers are divided into such narrow organizations that employers just ignore them. The American Federation of Labor is seen as ineffective. The rich are getting richer. The employing and ruling classes are one in the same. All over the world capitalism rules unchecked. Organized labor needs to do something. <br /><br />One hundred years ago some workers did! In June of 1905, a gathering of about two hundred socialists, anarchists, and radical unionists from all over America held a convention in Chicago, at which the Industrial Workers of the World was organized. Its founders included Big Bill Haywood of the Western Federation of Miners, Daniel De Leon, Eugene V. Debs, Thomas J. Hagerty, Lucy Parsons, Mary Harris Jones (&quot;Mother Jones&quot;), and Ralph Chaplin. Its goal then, as now, was to promotes industrial unionism, where all workers would be organized in solidarity into one union irrespective of race, color, ethnicity or gender. <br /><br />This year the Industrial Workers of the World celebrates its 100th anniversary. With historic and contemporary ties to Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, the IWW is one of the earliest labor organizations to advocate industrial unionism&mdash;organizing workers in their industries such as education, health care, or transportation. Today&rsquo;s USWA, UMWA, and UAW are all modern unions with historic roots as industrial organizations. However, decades before the great industrial steel, coal, and auto organizing in and around Pittsburgh during the 1930s, the IWW was on the scene educating workers about industrial solidarity and organizing with workers in industries such as tobacco, meat packing, and steel. <br /><br />The IWW has a significant history in Pittsburgh. In 1909 the IWW helped Slavic workers in McKees Rocks organize a massive strike against the Pressman Steel Car Company and the oppressive State Constabulary brought in to bust the strike. With their emphasis on inclusiveness and solidarity, only the Wobblies seem to have been able to effectively organize the Slavic workers who were mostly divided along ethnic, linguistic, and religious lines. In that same year the IWW helped organize a significant strike with the Sheet and tinplate workers in New Castle, PA. In that same city the IWW began publishing their well-known and highly influential publication called Solidarity. In 1912 the IWW tobacco workers struck in McKees Rocks and in 1913 the Wobblies organized a massive retaliatory strike of 800 cigar workers against Dry Slitz Stogie&rsquo;s lockout of 1200 workers. <br /><br />Today, the IWW fiercely honors and studies its history. However, today&rsquo;s IWW officially refutes violence but continue to advocate industrial organizing and workers&rsquo; direct action in the form of local strikes, sit-ins, slow-downs, pickets, massive sickouts and other tactics of disruption&mdash;just as the early Wobblies did. Ask any IWW member and you will quickly get a lesson about the union&rsquo;s historic struggles and founding principles. Call it the IWW &ldquo;long memory,&rdquo; the most radical idea in America, said labor activist Clara Barton. As an example, witness a standing agenda item to any Pittsburgh Branch meeting, where members rise up and sing what is, perhaps, the anthem to all of organized labor, &ldquo;Solidarity Forever.&rdquo; However, it&rsquo;s probable that only Wobblies remember that fellow worker Ralph Chaplin wrote that song for the IWW, not the trade unions. <br /><br />The Pittsburgh General Membership Branch will be holding its Centenary celebration on October 22nd from 10am to 6pm at the Pump House in Homestead, PA (where in 1892 striking steel workers courageously fought back against company guards and the state militia). The event is free and open to the public. On hand will be historic displays and artwork, radical literature, official IWW merchandise, and table displays presenting current IWW projects in the greater Pittsburgh area. There will also be free speech sessions on an actual soapbox where labor activists can step up in good old Wobbly fashion and shout out, &ldquo;Fellow Workers . . .&rdquo; <br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_244 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Pittsburgh General Membership Branch.
