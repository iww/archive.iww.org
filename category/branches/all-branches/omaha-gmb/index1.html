</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 12/20/2010 - 7:39am</p>
<p>On December 18th, 2010, members of the Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) and community supporters walked into the Open Harvest Natural Foods Cooperative Grocery’and presented management with a petition signed by supporters  and a letter demanding that IWW baker Andrew Losh be reinstated with  back wages for time missed. </p>
<p>“I love working at Open Harvest and I support their goals of providing  the community with sustainable and organic food,” Andrew Losh stated.  “I get along with my coworkers and enjoy interacting with all the  great customers that shop there on a regular basis,” he continued.  “But it seems as if the relationships between the management and the  employees have gone downhill lately.” </p>
<p>Losh was fired by his manager, Nancy Sauer, on December 3rd for not  maintaining an unspecified work pace. According to Losh, Sauer has a  history of treating employees unfairly. </p>
<p>On October 20th, 2010, Losh took a shift off. Despite giving notice  a month in advance, posting a request for a co-worker to take the  hours, and ultimately getting oral approval from his manager, Losh  was written up immediately upon return for not giving prior proper  notice. Losh contested this with his manager and a co-worker who  witnessed the approval verified his account. Yet this warning remained  in his file. </p>
<p>Community supporter and Open Harvest customer Jason Nord explained, “I  support Andrew's demand to be reinstated. I think it's important that  Open Harvest stay consistent with the values of an organic grocery  consumer co-op and not treat their employees in the same fashion any  other retail store does.” </p>
<p>According to a current employee at Open Harvest, who asked not to be  named out of fear of retaliation by management, “I feel like a large  part of the management here doesn't really respect us (the  employees).”</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 09/11/2010 - 3:05am</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg" align="right" />Since Starbucks baristas at the 15th and Douglas store in Omaha announced their membership in the IWW one month ago, Starbucks has unleashed an aggressive union busting campaign on the workers with a particularly extreme effort to intimidate and threaten FW Tyler Swain.</p>
<p>In response to this, all members of the Omaha SWU have voted unanimously to send out an appeal for solidarity to the broader IWW and labor movement. Please show Starbucks that an injury to one is an injury to all by taking the following actions:</p>
<p><b>1. Call Partner Resources Representative Shari Rugi, (314)607-4180</b></p>
<p>Shari Rugi is coordinating a campaign of intimidation and harassment against union members at the 15th and Douglas Starbucks. This intimidation has included fabrication of sexual harassment allegations and interrogation of union members at the store over these accusations concocted by management. Furthermore, Shari Rugi as directed the store manager at 15th and Douglas, Missy Kemp, to tighten policy and increase disciplinary actions against workers, in particular against FW Tyler Swain. Rugi has forced Store Manager Missy Kemp to write up FW Tyler Swain twice since going public for alleged violations of policy, contriving allegations of insubordination, and illegally tightening the time and attendance policy. weeks after these alleged violations have occurred. Union members at the 15th and Douglas location have, on multiple occasions, overheard conversations taking place between the store manager, Missy Kemp, and the partner resource manager, Shari Rugi, in which she has insisted FW Swain be written up for these alleged infractions, regardless of the store managers opinion of the events.</p>
<p>It's time to let Shari Rugi know that we as an organization will not tolerate the unfair and discriminatory treatment of public union members, and that we, as a global organization are well aware of her actions.</p>
<p><b>2. Call District Manager Jennifer Rojas, (402)319-2760</b></p>
<p>The District Manager has repeatedly disrespected workers in her area.</p>
<p>Based upon this level of disrespect, the final demand in the letter presented to management, including the 15th and Douglas store manager Missy Kemp, district manager Jennifer Rojas, and Regional Director of Operations Brett Battes, was a request that Jennifer Rojas resign from her position. A month after the delivery no mention of this demand has been made, despite targeted attempts to separate public union members from the company. It's time to let Jennifer Rojas know that her disrespect to workers in her area does not go unnoticed, and that she needs to be working for noticeable improvements in the working environment she oversees or resign immediately. Specific demands are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the immediate back pay of wages owed to FW Samantha Cole which were promised to her the morning of August 6th in a phone conversation that took place between Jennifer Rojas and Samantha Cole,</li>
<li>an open and cooperative dialogue between levels of management and the Starbucks Workers Union,</li>
<li>an open environment for members of the union to organize without fear of retaliation,</li>
<li>and an increased effort to put into place the district wide 20 percent wage increase that the union is fighting for.</li>

<a href="../../../../node/5147/" rel="bookmark">Squeezed Baristas Shut Down 15th and Douglas Starbucks to Protest Cutbacks</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 08/05/2010 - 3:23pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU630/Shattuck/640_3-27-06thru9-1-06290.jpg" align="right" width="280" height="210" />Omaha, NE- Baristas and community supporters shut down the 15th and Douglas Starbucks (SBUX) this morning demanding that management reverse all cuts to healthcare, staffing, and benefits that have been imposed during the recession. The baristas claim that executives have no justification to squeeze working families with Starbucks raking in profits of $977.2 million in the past four fiscal quarters.</p>
<p>"We are being squeezed, and we can't take it any more. Since the recession began, Starbucks executives have ruthlessly gutted our standard of living. They doubled the cost of our health insurance, reduced staffing levels, cut our hours, all while demanding more work from us. Starbucks is now more than profitable again. It's time for management to give back what they took from us," said Sasha McCoy, a shift supervisor at the store.</p>
<p>Since the onset of the recession, Starbucks imposed a series of deep cuts on its workforce. Starting in 2008 as the economic downturn began, the coffee giant shuttered over 800 stores and slashed over 18000 jobs. The remaining skeleton crew workforce was stretched out, forced to push VIA and other promotional products while keeping the stores running with insufficient staffing levels. CEO Howard Schultz then doubled the cost of the company health insurance plan in September 2009, leaving many workers unable to afford medical treatment because of sky-high
deductibles and premiums. While the cuts continue, Starbucks made a record profit of $207.9 million in the last quarter according to company figures.</p>
<p>The protesting baristas are members of the Starbucks Workers Union, which is an international campaign of the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. The store action makes the 15th and Douglas location the first Starbucks in Nebraska to have a public union presence. The workers decided to move to unionize after watching their standard of living be whittled away while top executives chose to reward investors with dividends.</p>
