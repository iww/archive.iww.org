</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/26/2016 - 8:35pm</p>
<p><strong>By Arun Gupta - <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/19576/beyond_the_fight_for_15_the_worker_led_fast_food_campaign_at_burgerville/">In These Times</a>, October 25, 2016</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/working/bv_850_638.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="240" alt="" />Last year, at age 17, Eli Fishel moved out of her parents&rsquo; house in Vancouver, Washington, squeezing into a three-bedroom apartment with five other roommates. To pay her bills as she finished high school, Fishel landed a job at <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/about/">Burgerville</a>, a fast-food chain with 42 outlets and more than <a href="http://www.bcigroup.com/customer-stories/burgerville">1,500 employees</a> in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Founded in 1961, Burgerville has cultivated a loyal following by <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/about/">emphasizing</a> fresh, local food, combined with sustainable business practices like renewable energy and recycling. But Fishel quickly realized she wasn&rsquo;t part of Burgerville&rsquo;s commitment to &ldquo;regional vitality&rdquo; and &ldquo;future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After 16 months on the job, she earns just $9.85 an hour, barely above the Washington State minimum wage. Her hours and shifts fluctuate weekly, with only a few days&rsquo; notice, and every month she goes hungry because she runs out of money to buy food.</p>
<p>Speaking of the privately-owned Burgerville, Fishel says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re poor because they&rsquo;re rich, and they&rsquo;re rich because we&rsquo;re poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disgruntled Burgerville workers began covertly organizing in 2015. The <a href="http://www.burgervilleworkersunion.org/">Burgerville Workers Union</a> (BVWU) <a href="http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/apr/26/burgerville-workers-union-raises/">went public</a> on April 26 with a march of more than 100 people through Portland, Oregon, and the delivery of a letter to the corporate headquarters in Vancouver. BVWU demands include a $5-an-hour raise for all hourly workers, recognition of a workers organization, affordable, quality healthcare, a safe and healthy workplace, and fair and consistent scheduling with ample notice.</p>
<p>Some BVWU members call their effort &ldquo;Fight for $15, 2.0,&rdquo; playing off the name of the fast-food worker campaign launched in 2011 by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).</p>
<p>SEIU has won plaudits for making the plight of low-wage workers a national issue and igniting the movement for new laws boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour. But the campaign has not, thus far, included efforts to unionize individual workplaces.</p>
<p>Unlike Fight for $15, which Middlebury College sociology professor and labor expert Jamie McCallum describes as &ldquo;a fairly top-down campaign,&rdquo; BVWU is a worker-initiated and -led project backed by numerous labor organizations. The group of Burgerville workers who came up with the idea includes members of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a militant union with West Coast roots that date back to the early 1900s. The campaign has the backing of the Portland chapter of IWW and the support SEIU Local 49, the Portland Association of Teachers, and Jobs with Justice.</p>
<p>This scrappy approach enabled BVWU to leapfrog Fight for $15 by declaring a union from the start. While BVWU has not yet formally petitioned for recognition and Burgerville has not chosen to voluntarily negotiate with it, the union has established worker committees in five stores, is developing units in a similar number of shops and counts scores of workers as members.</p>
<p>BVWU is full of lessons in how organizing works. One member likens the campaign to &ldquo;low-level guerrilla warfare&rdquo; with workers maneuvering to increase their ranks, build power on the shop floor, expand the terrain from shop to shop, while skirmishing with managers over the work process, and suffering casualties as some members have quit or say they were pushed out of their jobs at Burgerville. In the workplace, the strategy is to develop leaders, form committees for each store, and nurture trust and respect between workers. Outside, BVWU uses direct action to empower workers and bring suppliers into the conversation. The union also works to build community support by mobilizing social-justice groups, clergy, and organized labor to win over the public and pressure the company.</p>
<p>McCallum says that BVWU an example of social movement unionism. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about organizing as a class against another class,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to win demands not just against a single boss or to change a law, but to engage in class struggle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><img width="320" align="right" height="238" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/foodservwork_1.jpg" />By Admin - <a target="_blank" href="http://portlandiww.org/2016/05/burgerville-workers-unite/">Portland IWW</a>, May 1, 2016</strong></p>
<div class="post-entry">
<p>Portland, OR &ndash; In a historic move, workers at Portland-area fast food chain <a target="_blank" href="http://www.burgerville.com/">Burgerville</a> announced at a rally in the Clinton Street Theater on April 26th that they were forming a union, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.burgervilleworkersunion.org/">Burgerville Workers Union</a>, in affiliation with the Portland branch of the IWW. They marched from the theater to the Burgerville location at Southeast 26th and Clinton to present their demands:</p>
<ul>
<li>an immediate $5 an hour raise</li>
<li>affordable, quality healthcare</li>
<li>a safe and healthy workplace</li>
<li>fair and consistent scheduling with ample notice</li>
<li>a supportive, sustainable workplace including paid maternity/paternity leave</li>
<li>free childcare and transportation stipends</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical Burgerville worker makes only $9.60 an hour, and is typically scheduled just 26 hours a week, just under the 30 hours a week which would make them eligible to receive benefits. That equals out to about $990 a month before taxes. To put that into perspective, the average apartment rent in Portland is $1,275 a month for a one bedroom apartment, and most apartment complexes require prospective tenants income to exceed 3 times the amount of the rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people can&rsquo;t even afford to have an apartment. In Portland, everyone knows that the cost of living is insane. It basically took me a second job to be able to have a place of my own. I couldn&rsquo;t afford it with what Burgerville pays me,&rdquo; said Greg, Burgerville worker and union member.</p>
<p>Other workers cited problems with management&rsquo;s uncaring attitude toward their employees: &ldquo;I need to be able to take a sick day without fear of retaliation,&rdquo; stated Robert, a Burgerville worker at the Powell location.</p>
<p>The workers forming the <strong>Burgerville Workers Union</strong> represent a cross-section of the community &ndash; young people, seniors, mothers, fathers, students, and grandparents. They put passion into their work, and want to improve their workplaces for themselves, their co-workers, and the community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to make Burgerville a better place &ndash; I just want to be able to do my job and be paid a living wage. This is going to make Burgerville better, by having happy employees that work hard and are proud of their jobs&rdquo; said Debbie, Burgerville Worker Union member.</p>
<p>The Burgerville Workers Union is supported by the Portland IWW and endorsed by a coalition of local unions and community groups, including ILWU Local 5, IATSE Local 28, SEIU Local 49, Portland Association of Teachers, OPAL Environmental Justice Oregon, Portland Solidarity Network (PDXSol), Portland Jobs with Justice, Blue Heron Collective (Reed College), Portland Central America Solidarity Committee, Alberta Cooperative Grocery Collective Management, Hella 503 Collective, Marilyn Buck Abolitionist Collective and People&rsquo;s Food Co-op.</p>

<p>Email: paidsickdaysnow [at] gmail.com</p>
<p>Phone: 971-266-1891</p>
<p>Saturday, October 6, 2012 4pm, at Holladay Park, the Portland Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World and the IWW&rsquo;s Food &amp; Retail Workers United will hold a rally as part of a campaign to win paid sick days for all workers in Portland, Oregon. This event is sponsored by Laborers 483, American Friends Service Committee, We Are Oregon, Portland Jobs with Justice, Portland Central American Solidarity Committee, Portland Restaurant Workers Association, and the International Socialist Organization.</p>
<p>Featured at the rally will be speakers and musical acts, including Mic Crenshaw, The Crossettes, and I Wobble Wobble, as well as worker testimonies and opportunities to learn more about the campaign and get involved.</p>
<p>The rally officially kicks off our campaign, which is founded on the following mission:</p>
<p>We, the workers of Portland, acting in solidarity across industries, seek to improve the health and well-being of our fellow workers, families and communities. Therefore we demand that all employers within Portland provide all employees -- whether full-time, part-time or temporary -- with paid sick and safe days commensurate with hours worked.</p>
<p>Our Five Point Demand:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">1. All of us -- full time, part time and temporary workers -- deserve paid sick and safe days to care for ourselves and our families as members of the community.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">2. We call on all employers to provide paid sick and safe days immediately.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">3. We need paid sick and safe days to care for our own:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● illness, which includes physical and mental health issues</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● injury</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● preventative care</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● safety when experiencing domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● and bereavement for our family members.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">We -- as caregivers, parents, and partners -- need paid sick days to care for our:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● spouses &amp; domestic partners</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● biological, foster, or adopted children, stepchildren, and children of domestic partners</p>
<p class="rteindent1">● and other family members under our care</p>
<p class="rteindent1">4. Employers will implement a standard accrual rate of paid sick and safe days for all</p>
<p class="rteindent1">employees. The rate must be compassionate to the need of workers to care for both ourselves and our families.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">5. Employers will not interfere, discriminate, or retaliate against our request for or use of paid sick and safe days to care for ourselves and loved ones.</p>
<p>We cannot wait until it&rsquo;s politically convenient for paid sick &amp; safe days. A grassroots campaign led by the workers, families and communities who are most affected by the lack of paid sick days is a necessity to ensure we acquire a policy which meets our needs.</p>
<p>We call upon all workers and community allies interested in learning more and participating in our campaign to attend the rally on October 6 in Holladay Park!</p>
<p>&ldquo;An illness to one is contagious to all!&rdquo;</p>
