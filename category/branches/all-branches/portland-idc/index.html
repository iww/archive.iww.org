<p><b>Originally Published <a target="_blank" href="https://olympiaiww.com/2019/03/16/announcing-the-little-big-union/">Here</a>.</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/LittleBig1.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" align="right" />Workers at Little Big Burger know that our safety, well-being, and voices are important. Every single day we serve customers, cook food, bus tables, and wash dishes. We have formed the Little Big Union to ensure Little Big Burger is truly inclusive of our collective voice as workers.</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon is ground zero for fast food organizing. We love this city and call the Pacific Northwest our home. However, rent and the cost of living have continued to increase while our wages have not. Now, it is increasingly difficult to live in the neighborhoods we serve. This is why we are proud to stand in solidarity with the Burgerville Workers Union, as members of the Industrial Workers of the World, in the fight to make food service an honest, dignified, and dependable job.</p>
<p>Little Big Burger is no longer a small business, they were acquired by North Carolina-based multinational corporation Chanticleer Holdings in 2015. Us workers and our families depend on this job for our livelihood, and we hope those who prepare the food, serve the guests, and create the environment that has built Little Big Burger stand to grow with our company. Workers continue to struggle by stretching our paychecks month to month, surviving off minimum wage, unreliable tips, and inconsistent schedules released often a day or two before we work. We are proud of the hard work we provide Little Big Burger, which is why we demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 raises</li>
<li>Fair and consistent scheduling</li>
<li>Safe and Healthy workplaces</li>
<li>Respectful and professional conduct from management</li>
<li>Benefits like child care, paid parental leave, quality healthcare, food boxes, bus passes, parking passes, and shift beers</li>
<li>Paid sick leave and vacation time</li>
<li>Worker autonomy to refuse service to abusive/dangerous customers</li>
<li>Holiday pay</li>
<li>Transparent hiring and firing policies</li>
<li>Sanctuary workplaces</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-fight-and-win-job-back/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, July 12, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/1-4.jpg" width="320" height="185" align="right" alt="" />Report from the Burgerville Workers Union of the IWW who recently fought and won the rehiring of a co-worker.</span></em></p>
<p>Meet Brookelynn, a longtime Burgerville worker at the Gladstone store and a strong union supporter. She worked at Burgerville for two years before leaving the job in December for family reasons. Brookelynn reapplied shortly afterwards, much to everyone&rsquo;s excitement, and it&rsquo;s even Burgerville policy to rehire workers who reapply within three months of quitting</p>
<p>Because of how strong a union supporter she is, however, Burgerville refused to rehire her, violating their own policy. The General Manager, Michael Dawson, hired at least ten other people while Brookelynn kept reapplying, discriminating against her over and over again for her union membership. Meanwhile, Burgerville has spent thousands and thousands of dollars on ads claiming to value their employees and that they do not intimidate or retaliate against workers for being part of the union.</p>
<p>After months of fighting, Brookelynn and the union finally won her job back! She returned to work today and everyone is thrilled. Furthermore, the National Labor Relations Board found merit in Brookelynn&rsquo;s charges of anti-union discrimination, which means Burgerville will likely face legal consequences for their union busting activity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited about the ongoing contract negotiations, but this just goes to show how important it is to keep fighting outside the bargaining room as well.</p>
<p>Welcome back, Brookelynn! When we fight, we win!</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 05/15/2018 - 7:50pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-wins-second-victory/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, May 14, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/BVWU2018S_0.jpg" width="320" height="186" align="right" alt="" />The following statement was released yesterday from the Burgerville Workers Union, after another store successfully won union recognition. The BVWU is the first officially recognized fast food union in the United States and is a part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</span></em></p>
<p>Today Burgerville workers once again voted overwhelmingly in favor of the BVWU, this time at the Gladstone location. This is the second NLRB election the BVWU has won in a month. The first, at 92nd and Powell, made us the only fast food union in the country, and this one demonstrates the momentum the BVWU has going into contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Gladstone workers in particular deserve extra celebration for their win today. Despite the friendly attitude Burgervi<span class="text_exposed_show">lle has taken in the press about being willing to work with the union, Gladstone workers didn&rsquo;t see anything close to friendliness on the shop floor. During the election, despite all their words of openness and cooperation, Burgerville was up to its old tricks: retaliation, intimidation, even straight up lying. Gladstone workers faced down all of that and STILL won a major victory for the union. Standing up to your boss like that takes bravery and every one of them deserves applause.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>The win at 92nd wasn&rsquo;t the end of the fight, and neither is this win at Gladstone. The fight won&rsquo;t be over until Burgerville stops paying us poverty wages, stops threatening undocumented immigrants through their use of e-verify, and stops treating us like we&rsquo;re disposable. We demand respect, and we won&rsquo;t stop until we get it. Gladstone is an important step in that journey.</p>
<p>Remember too that the boycott is on until the company signs a fair contract. They&rsquo;re not off the hook yet.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 04/30/2018 - 1:45pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-becomes-first-formally-recognized-fast-food-union-in-us/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, April 24, 2018</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Burgerville.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="220" align="right" />Burgerville Workers Union has won a union election in one location, meaning that the company will be forced to negotiate a contract with the workers. Other stores are expected to soon come on board. BVWU, a part of the IWW, also becomes the first fast food chain in the US to be unionized. </em></span></p>
<p>We won the election. We did it. We made history.</p>
<p>Today workers at 92nd and Powell overwhelmingly voted yes, making the Burgerville Workers Union the only formally recognized fast food union in the country. For a long time people have dismissed fast food as unorganizable, saying that turnover is too high, or the workers are too spread out. Today Burgerville workers proved them wrong.</p>
<p>The fight isn&rsquo;t over, of course. We still need to bargain a fair contract with Burgerville, an<span class="text_exposed_show">d until then the boycott still stands. And we need to remember what got us to this point: workers taking action for themselves, standing up against poverty wages and horrible conditions. We got here because of the strike, union benefits, pickets, and marches on the boss. We got here through direct action, and that won&rsquo;t change now that we&rsquo;ve won an election. If anything it&rsquo;s even more important.</span></p>
<p>In this moment of victory we want to celebrate, yes, but we also want to turn our attention to the 4.5 million other fast food workers in the United States. We want to speak to everyone else who works for poverty wages, who are constantly disrespected on the job, who are told they aren&rsquo;t educated enough, aren&rsquo;t experienced enough, aren&rsquo;t good enough for a decent life. To all of those workers, to everyone like us who works rough jobs for terrible pay, we say this:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to that bullshit. Burgerville workers didn&rsquo;t, and look at us now.</p>
<p>Because our win today isn&rsquo;t just about Burgerville. It&rsquo;s about history. It&rsquo;s about a movement of workers who know that a better world is possible, and that together they can make that world real.</p>
<p>Today we became the only recognized fast food union in the country. But we won&rsquo;t be the only one for long.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 02/21/2018 - 9:08pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/portland-burgerville-singles-one-worker-retaliation-following-strike/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, February 16, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/5-13-1068x648.jpg" width="320" height="194" align="right" alt="" />The following report from the Burgerville Workers Union states that management has come down against one pro-union worker of color since the end of the historic three day strike. To learn more about the strike, </em><a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/audio-report-burgerville-workers-union-finish-three-day-strike/" target="_blank"><em>check out our audio report podcast here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Burgerville chose to celebrate Valentine&rsquo;s Day yesterday by retaliating against a union leader. Michelle, a worker at the Convention Center Burgerville who participated in our historic three day long strike, was just suspended by management for allegedly taking a chicken patty without permission.</p>
<p>Though retaliation against union members under trumped up &ldquo;theft&rdquo; accusations is a pattern at Burgerville, Michelle&rsquo;s suspension demonstrates a particularly disturbing unders<span class="text_exposed_show">ide to that pattern. Along with Arsenio and Canaan, Michelle is the third pro-union worker of color to be fired by Convention Center management in as many weeks, a management which remains entirely white despite the diversity of the crew. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">In the targeting of union members of color at the Convention Center, to put it bluntly, we see not only union busting but outright racism. These attacks on our jobs and our families by Burgerville corporate are not just against Burgerville workers, but rather against the rights and power of the Portland community as a whole.</span></p>
<p>The BVWU does not take this lightly. In addition to Arsenio, Canaan, and Michelle, two other pro-union workers at stores that went on strike have been fired or suspended for similar charges within the last few months. Though Burgerville claims to be an ethical, locally minded fast food company, their wages keep workers in poverty, and when those workers try to better their lives, they are threatened with firing.</p>
<p>In Michelle&rsquo;s suspension, we see Burgerville perpetuating an atmosphere of fear and racism in order to fight the union, and we are currently in talks with our allies around Portland as well as our legal counsel as to how to best proceed. Please stay tuned &ndash; moments like these, when people&rsquo;s jobs are on the line, are when we need our supporters the most.</p>
