</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 09/04/2017 - 8:54pm</p>
<p><strong>By Staff - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/portland-fast-food-workers-burgerville-launch-strike-labor-day/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, September 4, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/3-4-1068x599.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" align="right" />Members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) launched a strike in Portland, Oregon at fast food chain Burgerville. The strike is the latest move by workers at the chain who have been organizing for months and demanding wage increases, an end to harassment for union activities, better schedules, and improvements of conditions. The group announced the strike on Labor Day with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/burgervilleworkersunion/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank">statement on their Facebook page:</a></p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The very first Labor Day was a massive strike and parade organized by thousands of workers in New York City in 1882. The chance for millions and millions of people to spend time with family and community this Monday was made possible by power wielded time and time again by striking workers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically, we workers at Burgerville don&rsquo;t get to enjoy this day dedicated to celebrating the power of workers. Working at Burgerville means we can&rsquo;t ta<span class="text_exposed_show">ke proper holidays, since doing so means taking a substantial pay cut or facing retaliation from management. Working at Burgerville means that we spend our holidays working for minimum wage just like any other day, fully aware of all the memories with friends and family we are missing out on. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">That&rsquo;s why we are going on strike today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead of going to work for poverty wages while corporate bigshots take vacations, we are taking a stand. We are taking back Labor Day for our families, our friends, our coworkers, and ourselves. We are taking back Labor Day because we know that better pay, fair schedules, consistent hours, and healthier work environments have only ever been won by workers standing together and fighting for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are the heart of Burgerville and we deserve a change!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strike also takes place as fast food workers at McDonald&rsquo;s in the UK are also on strike. Burgerville workers union writes:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">McDonald&rsquo;s workers at two shops in England voted to go on a strike on September 4. These workers are organized through the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU), whose demands include wage increases and more consistent scheduling (Sound familiar?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Immediately after the announcement of a strike, McDonald&rsquo;s stated that by the end of 2017 they will implement a guaranteed hours contract to every McDonald&rsquo;s worker in the UK. The BFAWU&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">plans to carry on with their strike to push for their other demands and to hold McDonald&rsquo;s to their word.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victory to the strikers!</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:03pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://portlandiww.org/2017/08/official-endorsement-voz-workers-rights-education-project-pdx-iww/" target="_blank">Portland IWW</a> - August 15, 2017 </strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/cropped-header1.png" align="right" alt="" />The Portland IWW is proud to endorse Voz: Workers&rsquo; Rights Education Project. Founded in 2000, Voz has been connecting day laborers to work, supporting worker-led organizing, and offering trainings.</p>
<p>Voz is a worker-led organization that gives power to immigrant workers that may not otherwise have the means to organize and bargain for humane working conditions and fair wages. Having the ability to organize and fight for these universal goals gives immigrants the ability to work, to better empower and enrich their communities and lives. </p>
<p>The Voz: Workers Rights Education Project is currently campaigning for their Building The Dream campaign, petitioning the city of Portland for the rights to purchase the property at 240 NE Martin Luther King JR Blvd., to provide immigrant workers and day laborers with a place to meet potential employers, discuss the conditions of their labor, while having the choice to sell their labor to whomever they believe will give them the respect that they deserve.</p>
<p>As such, Voz requires support from community organizations to help them fight for these rights, and to show the city of Portland that the community stands with them and will help defend the exploited and under-privileged workers that move our city and society forward. The Portland Industrial Workers of the World has long worked alongside the VOZ: Workers Rights Education Project and firmly believes that day laborers &ndash; like all workers &ndash; should have secure sites from which to organize and direct their own labor.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/01/2017 - 7:47pm</p>
<p><strong>Pete Shaw - <a href="http://www.portlandoccupier.org/2017/07/19/11521/" target="_blank"><em>Portland Occupier</em></a>, July 19, 2017</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/BVWU.jpg" width="320" height="480" align="right" alt="" />The shakes&ndash;blackberry, chocolate hazelnut, and pumpkin spice&ndash;come and go. So do the Walla Walla onion rings, waffle fries, and asparagus. But since April of last year, solidarity has always been in season at Burgerville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its formation 15 months ago, the Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU)&ndash;which is supported by the Portland Industrial Workers of the World&ndash;has been organizing for better working conditions on the job, greater benefits, and higher wages. Fighting against a management that promotes the Burgerville corporation as one which supports family values, local farmers, and sustainable practices, but treats its workers no differently than people have come to expect from larger fast food chains such as McDonald&rsquo;s, the Burgerville Workers Union has slowly but surely been gathering steam in its struggle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Burgerville management has so far refused to talk with the union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday July 14, the BVWU took another small but significant step toward pushing Burgerville&rsquo;s management to start negotiating with it. A crowd of over 100 people picketed outside the Burgerville on Southeast 92</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Powell during the early evening, virtually shutting down business at the store. On a hot night when one of the raspberry shakes would have made a delightful treat, only a few customers crossed the picket line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a rally just prior to establishing the line, Mark Medina of the BVWU told the gathered crowd, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna shut down the shop for a couple of hours and make corporate know that workers care about benefits, about wages, and that they want Burgerville to negotiate with the union and respect the rights of workers here in Portland, Oregon. This is a union town. They should respect our rights to organize.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That lack of respect was given official imprimatur when on June 22 Burgerville agreed to pay $10,000 to settle </span><a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-NOI.pdf" data-slimstat="3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charges brought against it by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BOLI) that between August 1 and August 15, 2015 the company willfully &ldquo;failed to provide a meal period of not less than 30 continuous minutes during which the employee is relieved of all duties and/or failed to provide timely meal periods to twenty-eight employees&rdquo; as required by law. Another 16 employees were also denied their 30-minute work-free meal period during a two-week period in December, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to those charges, BOLI found that Burgerville was &ldquo;employing minors under 18 in hazardous and permitted occupation&rdquo; when two 17 year old employees operated a trash compactor which Oregon law has declared &ldquo;hazardous and detrimental to to the health of employees under the age of 18.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All charges pertained to the Burgerville store on NE Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, near the Oregon Convention Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandon Doyle, BVWU Shop Leader at the SE 92</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Powell Burgerville, is one of many Burgerville workers who has seen the company&rsquo;s scarce regard for workers up close and personal. A few months ago Doyle was feeling ill to the point of vomiting while on the job. Instead of allowing him to go home and rest&ndash;as well as not risk getting Burgerville customers sick&ndash;Doyle&rsquo;s manager insisted he remain at work. Fortunately, Doyle and his fellow workers contacted fellow union members from other stores, who then contacted Doyle&rsquo;s manager, eventually resulting in Doyle being allowed to leave and likely helping prevent the spread of what ailed him. They had his back, and Doyle now wants to return the favor.</span></p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 07/18/2017 - 8:28pm</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>By staff - <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/2017/07/burgerville-pays-10000-to-settle-wage-and-hour-violations/" target="_blank"><em>NW Labor Press</em></a>, July 6, 2017</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The Burgerville fast food chain &mdash; target of a 14-month union campaign to improve wages and working conditions &mdash; on June 22 agreed to pay $10,000 to settle charges that it willfully failed to give workers meal and rest breaks as required by law.</p>
<p class="p1 rteleft"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11554" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/BWU-logo-black_0.png" width="263" height="300" align="right" alt="" />Oregon law requires employers to provide paid rest periods of at least 10 minutes for each four-hour work period, and a duty-free meal period of at least 30 minutes when employees work six or more hours at a time.</p>
<p class="p1">The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) first <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BOLIletterToBV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> to Burgerville on April 7, 2016, saying it received information that the company may not have been providing rest breaks and meal periods at its Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard restaurant in Portland. The letter asked the company to review its practices and take immediate steps to correct the situation. Burgerville&rsquo;s chief operating officer <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BVletterToBOLI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote back</a> April 18 to say the company had retrained the entire management team and would meet with all 40 employees to make sure they know about the requirement that they take breaks.</p>
<p class="p1">But the practice continued: Two other employees complained in August, and BOLI sent another letter, and opened an investigation. The investigation found that over two-week periods in August and December 2016, managers &ldquo;willfully&rdquo; failed to provide meal periods to 28 and 16 employees respectively. Willful, in this case, is a legal term meaning the company knew about the requirement for meal breaks, and also knew that workers weren&rsquo;t getting them. The agency <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-NOI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> 44 violations total, and assessed $250 per violation, for $11,000 in all. BOLI also found three cases in which minors were performing a hazardous duty &mdash; operating a trash compactor &mdash; and assessed $250 per violation for those.</p>
<p class="p1">On June 2, 2017, the agency issued a notice that it intended to assess civil penalties of $11,750. The Vancouver-based fast food chain <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-FOID-w-Agreed-Settlement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to pay $10,000 to settle all the charges.</p>
<p class="p1">Burgerville Workers Union, affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World, has been campaigning since April 2016 for a $5 an hour raise, affordable health care, and other demands. The Oregon AFL-CIO and half a dozen other labor organizations have endorsed their campaign.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 05/25/2017 - 7:05pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Portland IWW - <a href="http://portlandiww.org/2017/05/portland-may-day-2017-official-response/" target="_blank">Portland IWW</a>, May 4, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/xPortland-LOGO.png.pagespeed.ic.eyvHj59-oJ/" align="right" alt="" />This was originally sent to KOIN 6 as a response to the events that took place on May Day in Portland.</em></p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World is proud that we were able to celebrate International Workers Day and march in solidarity with so many organizations which are essential and vibrant to the community of Portland and at large. International Workers Day is an important holiday that showcases the struggle of all workers against the wholesale societal systemic oppression brought about by corporations, CEOs, and the mega-rich capitalist class. The fact that there was such a strong contingent of marchers from all walks of life is representative of the American working class.</p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s use of violence against workers and their families &ndash; as well as the children who were in the crowd celebrating the holiday with their parents &ndash; is a travesty and a violation of both human rights, as well as the right to peaceful assembly. We condemn their efforts in restricting accessibility to fellow workers with disabilities, and their blatant disregard for the health and well-being of the people they have sworn to protect. By direct contrast, they assisted visible white supremacists and white nationalists at the &ldquo;March for Free Speech 82nd Ave,&rdquo; specifically a non-permitted march by pro-Trump supporters on April 29th by chartering Tri-Met buses and public transportation to get these people, some of whom were making Nazi salutes during their protest, back to their vehicles.</p>
<p>Our goal is and has always been to support and assist the workers of the world, and we will continue to fight for the needs of all in the face of police and capitalist oppression, and stand by our watchword that an injury to one is an injury to all. As such, the Portland Police Bureau inflicted shameful injury against the workers, their families, and their children during the May Day march; we will stand against that in solidarity with our fellow workers.</p>
