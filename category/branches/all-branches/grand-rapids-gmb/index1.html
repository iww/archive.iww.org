</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 09/06/2010 - 3:01pm</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.wzzm13.com/news/news_story.aspx?storyid=130011&amp;catid=14" target="_blank">By Brent Ashcroft - WZZM13.com, September 6, 2010</a></b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU640/fists-raisedsm.jpg" align="right" />Grand Rapids, Mi. (WZZM) - Demands for improvements to working conditions have some Jimmy John's employees unionizing around the nation. One West Michigan location will be a test-ground on Labor Day.</p>
<p>About twenty I.W.W (Industrial Workers of the World) members, from the Grand Rapids chapter, will picket in front of the Wealthy St. Jimmy John's Monday from noon to 1pm, representing the franchise's employees across the nation who feel they're underappreciated in the workplace, in support of the Jimmy John's labor dispute in Minneapolis which started it all.</p>
<p>"A lot of Jimmy John's workers are asked to work one and two hour shifts, or are expected to put wear and tear on their vehicles without compensation," says Cole Dorsey, Grand Rapids organizer of the I.W.W. "It's difficult to get sick days or to get job-related workman's compensation [from Jimmy John's management]."</p>
<p>So, Dorsey and the rest of the Grand Rapids I.W.W. will represent area Jimmy John's employees in protest Monday. Leafleting and picketing is planned for 32 of the 39 states in which Jimmy John's operates.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Jimmy John's co-owner, Mike Mulligan said in a statement last week: "We are very proud of our employment record in Minneapolis and take issue with the claims of the I.W.W. We value our relationship with our employees and offer competitive wages and good local jobs. We are dedicated to providing a fair, equal and diverse workplace environment."</p>
<p>Dorsey, and his I.W.W. members, don't see it that way.</p>
<p>"Sexual harrassment, better pay, benefits for non-managerial employees - that's what the union workers, the sisters and brothers in Minneapolis, want from us on Labor Day," says Dorsey.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/01/2009 - 7:40pm</p>
Why We Occupied Senator Levinâ€™s Office
Today, we occupied Senator Carl Levinâ€™s office in Grand Rapids as a protest against the current administrationâ€™s decision to escalate the US war in Afghanistan. We do this not simply because we are against war, but because this decision by the Obama administration is unjust.
The US is not in Afghanistan to bring Democracy â€“ Since 1979, the US has supported anti-democratic forces such as the Mujahadeen, the Northern Alliance, the Taliban and a variety of individual warlords. The US has also supported the current regime of Karzai, knowing full well that his administration has been corrupt from the beginning.

A National Labor Relations Board regional director in Detroit Jan. 16
approved a settlement agreement with Starbucks Corp. resolving allegations of
unfair labor practices by the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU), an affiliate of the
Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), filed with NLRB Region 7 (Starbucks Corp.
d/b/a Starbucks Coffee Co., N.L.R.B. Reg. Dir., No. 7-CA-51190, settlement
approved 1/16/09).
</div>
<br />
<div>
The NLRB regional office in Detroit had found sufficient evidence to
establish an employer violation of the National Labor Relations Act at a
Starbucks store in Grand Rapids, Mich., according to Stephen Glasser, NLRB
regional director for Region 7.
</div>
<br />
<div>
The Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) filed several charges April
15, one of which NLRB found to be a possible violation of the act. On behalf of
fired worker Cole Dorsey, SWU claimed Starbucks illegally fired a worker who had
been involved in union activities.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Glasser said NLRB concluded there was sufficient evidence to establish
Dorsey was fired for his union activities and support for the union. &quot;We thought
we could prove that,&quot; he told BNA Jan. 9. Starbucks had said it fired Dorsey for
attendance issues, Glasser said.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Reinstatement Not Required.
</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div>
Under the settlement, reached one day before a trial was to be held,
Starbucks will expunge record of the termination from the employee's personnel
file and will post a notice for 60 days at the Grand Rapids, Mich., store
outlining employees' rights under the NLRA.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Under the settlement, Starbucks is not required to reinstate the employee
or issue back pay. Although the union had sought Dorsey's reinstatement, NLRB
determined that it would not be appropriate, Glasser said.

Starbucks has reached a settlement in principle over a Michigan barista
whom the National Labor Relations Board said was fired in June because of his
union activities.
</div>
<br />
<div>
An administrative trial that was scheduled for today has been canceled, and
the agreement is expected to be signed this week, said Chet Byerly, resident
officer for the NLRB in Grand Rapids. He would not disclose details of the
proposed agreement.
</div>
<br />
<div>
A Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed that it is working on a
settlement.
</div>
<br />
<div>
It is the third time in a month that Starbucks has faced action from the
NLRB regarding the Industrial Workers of the World union.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Last month, an NLRB administrative law judge found that Starbucks took part
in unfair labor practices at several of its New York cafes.

<strong>Starbucks is to begin proceedings Wednesday in a third case in which it
allegedly fired a barista because of his union activities.</strong>
</div>
<br />

The union lumps keep coming for Starbucks, which was thumped by the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) last month for unfair labor practices at
several New York cafes.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Last week, the company settled a separate NLRB dispute in Michigan and on
Wednesday is to begin proceedings there in a third case in which it allegedly
fired a barista because of his union activities.
</div>
<br />
<div>
All three cases were initiated by baristas affiliated with the Industrial 
Workers of the World (IWW), a century-old union that has worked for several
years to improve conditions for Starbucks workers.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In New York, an administrative-law judge with the NLRB said last month that
work rules were unfairly imposed on employees who supported the union. The
coffee chain was ordered to give back jobs to three former workers and
compensate them for lost earnings. The company also must post notices informing
employees of their labor-organizing rights.
