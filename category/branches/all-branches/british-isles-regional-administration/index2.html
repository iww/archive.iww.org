<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 09/20/2015 - 3:09pm</p>
<p><b><strong>By Kasparkonsequent</strong></b><b> - <a href="https://wearetherabl.wordpress.com/2015/09/18/porn-sex-positivity-and-working-class-solidarity/" target="_blank"><em>Red and Black Leeds</em></a>, September 18, 2015<br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/212x322xwomenwobglobe.jpg.pagespeed.ic.1NtqxA-n45/" alt="" />The UK&rsquo;s gradually expanding porn law restrictions have been going on for years and eventually came to a climax the end of 2014, when previously existing <a target="_blank" href="http://mylesjackman.com.php/my-blog/106-the-following-content-is-not-acceptable">restrictions</a> were applied to all pornographic material made in the UK. Though I still see the occasional protest against this, and a few campaigners are still trying to overturn it, the flurry of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/12/face-sitting-protest-outside-parliament-against-new-porn-rules">outrage</a> has largely died down. My aim here is not to defend the ban, but to critique the way this has been discussed, so we might be able to distinguish in future between what some members of the public want the sex industry to be, and an expression of working class solidarity towards those of us who work in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious to most people that the list of banned acts represents pure moralising, and that the people who made this list seem to have a particular idea of what normal sex is and should be (part of which, as a number of people have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/02/uk-porn-law-sexist-female-ejaculation-ban_n_6254678.html">noted</a>, seems to be based on the idea that sex is something that women do for men). The legislation is clearly not about what should or shouldn&rsquo;t happen on a porn set, but is entirely about what should be depicted and how. This is no mistake, the changes are part of the Obscene Publications Act, designed to outlaw any material that &ldquo;tends to deprave and corrupt&rdquo;. The fact that some of the banned acts are also things that many workers will want to avoid at work is coincidental and not the purpose of the ban. This becomes apparent when we see that vomiting, for example from facefucking, is something that is acceptable &ldquo;if it is not performed as part of the sexual act, and is not visibly enjoyed by the participants&rdquo;. The important phrase is &ldquo;visibly enjoyed&rdquo;, as the issue is not whether or not the worker is actually enjoying having the back of their throat hit until they vomit, but whether or not they have the inclination or acting ability to portray someone who does enjoy it. And according to the OPA they should not appear to enjoy it as it might give people watching the idea that this could be fun. However if your work involves occasional uncontrolled vomiting and you look suitably unimpressed by it when it happens, then as far as this legislation is concerned that&rsquo;s fine and nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Whether consciously or not, a lot of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/11270359/Porn-laws-Banning-spanking-is-bonkers-and-downright-frightening.html">responses</a> to this have mirrored the same attitude in the sense that they&rsquo;ve not been about what the work is like for those people having sex on camera, but about what consumers think should or shouldn&rsquo;t be depicted, and how it should be represented, and what porn should look like to portray sex in a certain way to society. Progressives all over the UK have complained that they want female pleasure to be depicted and so are against the ban on female ejaculation, that they want women to be shown as empowered in sex and so are against the ban on face-sitting, that they want a variety of sexual acts to be represented so we aren&rsquo;t conditioned to masturbate only to the same tired misogynistic porn formula. This is fair enough. It&rsquo;s not only films and high art that influence our society and how we think, but all the media we consume. Even if all the porn actors on set were to be bored out of their minds, hate each other, and feel disgusted by the thought of having to get it on for the camera, if they produce a work of fiction that depicts the healthy negotiating of consent, where the people having sex are smiling at each other while on camera, where women are portrayed as having their own sexual desires, that could have a positive affect on people watching it.</p>

<p><strong>By members of the Merseyside IWW &ndash; <a target="_blank" href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/08/05/your-class-needs-you/">Liverpool IWW</a>, August 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p>About twenty people met in Liverpool Central Library&rsquo;s meeting room 2 last night, as part of IWW national secretary Dave Pike&rsquo;s speaking tour of England, Scotland and Wales. Dave&rsquo;s presentation &ndash; called &lsquo;Your Class Needs You&rsquo; &ndash; attracted a mixture of members, prospective new wobblies (or &lsquo;probblies&rsquo; in IWW lingo) and people who were just curious what the IWW they knew from tales of Joe Hill were up to nearly a century after his murder.</p>
<p>It was a lot less eventful than the last time Liverpool IWW met on William Brown Street. In 1921, scouse wobblies led by the writer George Garrett occupied the front of the Walker Art Gallery, and were met with a <a target="_blank" href="https://libcom.org/history/garrett-george-1896-1996">full scale police riot</a>.</p>
<p>For all us IWW members love the old stories, this was evening very much focused on the IWW of today, and how a new generation of relatively young, casualised workers are leading the way with some inspirational campaigns and struggles. We watched videos of workers from Starbucks, Jimmy Johns and London language schools fighting for improvements to their working lives.</p>
<p>The modern day Liverpool IWW are planning some big things over the next few months, and are thrilled to have settled into our new home of Liverpool Central Library.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 03/11/2012 - 1:37pm</p>
<p>By Chris Ford, Industrial Workers of the World, London Regional Secretary - March 5, 1990.</p>
<p>Today after a long and high profile campaign the IWW secured a victory for our cleaner members mployed at Exchange Tower who will now be paid the London Living Wage of &pound;8.30 per hour. For ten years many members have been earning poverty wages on the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The arrival of the IWW immediately set about changing this situation launching a campaign for the London Living Wage, this saw widespread publicity, a motion in Parliament, our members stood firm in the face of the intimidation of the management company Cashmens who also managed Heron Tower.</p>
<p>On March 8th IWW in Frankfurt and industrial unionists in Warsaw and Tokyo were planning solidarity demonstrations at the offices of the MGPA owners of Exchange Tower.</p>
<p>But the employers have conceded to the just demands of the workers.</p>
<p>Some of the traditional unions at Canary Wharf have abandoned cleaners - full-time officials declared 'you need to keep your head down in a recession'.</p>
<p>The IWW has continued to fight, organising the unorganised, the abandoned and the betrayed. At Reuters nearby IWW is engaged in another campaign for the London Living Wage and for the removal of a gang of a feral managers intimidating cleaners.</p>
<p>The gains at Exchange Tower send a clear message that solidarity wins justice in the workplace! Thank you to all our members and supporters.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 01/05/2012 - 7:15pm</p>
<p>Cleaners at the Guildhall have been holding a sit in and stopping work since the 22nd of December because of mistreatment and intimidation. Early this morning [4th of January] management called the police, who came and intimidated and threatened the cleaners. The cleaners protested that they were holding a completely peaceful sit-in. They finally left due to police threats to drag them out physically.</p>
<p>The cleaners started organising in the summer, striking against unpaid wages. Since then they have been fighting for union recognition, better pay and an end to bad working conditions. After a new company, Sodexo, took over the cleaning contract, their union rep was suspended and they have been subject to all kinds of intimidation and abuse. The workers say there is one supervisor in particular who is abusive to them and there are currently various complaints by different cleaners against him, but Sodexho are refusing to do anything about his behaviour. Sodexho are trying to drive out the organised cleaners by continually changing their work areas, giving them the worst jobs, increasing their workload and, now, using intimidation and harassment.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 08/01/2011 - 1:42pm</p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Guildhall%20demo.img_assist_custom-251x141.jpg" alt="" />Cleaners at the Corporation of London, Guildhall have achieved a significant victory in a dispute with their sub-contractor Ocean Contract Cleaning London Ltd. Organised in the London IWW Cleaners and Allied Industries Branch (IU 640) this has been a major achievement for the workers and the IWW as a whole. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Guildhall was built between 1411 and 1440 as a symbol of the English ruling elite &ndash; many of its labour policies remain stuck in its medieval past. The workers who maintain the splendour of the Guildhall are on a miserable &pound;5.93 per hour, they receive no sick pay or pension. They are hired through Ocean Contract Cleaning. A company also with a long history worthy of a medieval establishment - in 2006 London Citizens uncovered that workers employed by Ocean at a London University were being commonly under-paid or not paid at all. Those cleaners recovered &pound;50,000 in unpaid wages. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">At the Guildhall the cleaners found themselves in a similar situation of being repeatedly underpaid in their wages going back months. Some waited two to three months to get wages they were owed. They even had the Public Holiday for the Royal Wedding deducted from their holiday leave. To add insult to injury the workers who are overwhelmingly migrants, from Latin America, Asia and Africa are subjected to management abuses now common place in the cleaning industry, petty bullying, and disciplinaries for next to nothing. If you are five minutes late you are sent home, if you are late again you are fired. IWW members have reported being threatened with dismissal for being two-minutes late. </p>
