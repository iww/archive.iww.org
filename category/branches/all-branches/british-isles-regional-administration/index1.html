</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 11/04/2015 - 7:07pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/press-release-liverpool-iww-calls-for-demonstration-against-fines-for-the-homeless/" target="_blank">Liverpool IWW</a>, November 4, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" src="https://liverpooliww.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/homelessness.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200" alt="" />Liverpool IWW condemns the council&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;<a href="https://bit.ly/1MysqpE">Public Space Protection Order</a>&rdquo;, under which the homeless could be fined up to &pound;1,000 for the &lsquo;crime&rsquo; of begging. We call on the people of Liverpool to show their opposition, by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/849669795153622/">demonstrating</a> at St Luke&rsquo;s bombed out church a week on Saturday (14th November) from 12 noon, and signing the <a href="https://chn.ge/1Wyr0Ru">Change.org petition</a>, which already had nearly 7,000 signatures at the time of going to press.</p>
<p>It is shocking that we find ourselves in a position where we need to argue for the right of homeless people not to be fined for their poverty, but thanks to greedy mayor Joe Anderson this is exactly the situation we are in. No-one begs for the fun of it. People beg out of desperation, because our society has badly let them down. &pound;1,000 would be a huge amount of money for any working class person, but for a homeless person it is almost unimaginable, and could never be paid.</p>
<p>If Liverpool Labour wanted people to stop begging, they would stop implementing policies which massively increase poverty in our city. Instead, they aim to criminalise deprivation, in order to create a corporate paradise in Liverpool One, the Central &lsquo;Business Improvement District&rsquo;, and beyond. While Joe Anderson claims that his hands are tied by the Tory government when he makes spending cuts, it is his anti-homeless crusade which really shows what kind of man he is. Not content with using the police to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/02/liverpool-police-accused-of-trying-to-starve-activists-out-of-occupied-bank">starve homeless people out of a former bank</a> a few months back, he now seeks to use crushing fines to force homeless people out of the city where they may well have family and friends.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 5:11pm</p>
<p><strong>By Some Angry Workers - <a href="https://angryworkersworld.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/open-letter-to-iww-members/" target="_blank">Angry Workers of the World</a>, October 11, 2015</strong></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s. We have republished this open letter to our union in order to stimulate discussion:<br />
</em></p>
<p><img width="320" height="226" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/tumblr_inline_n9nbxtzcgl1rby4la.jpg" alt="" />Autumnal greetings comrades!</p>
<p>We have known some of you for a while, and met some more of you recently on our film screening &lsquo;tour&rsquo; earlier this year. It was great to make some new friends and have some good discussions about what we&rsquo;re all up to. We thought we&rsquo;d get in touch with you about some proposals for joint work in the coming year, let us know if you&rsquo;re interested!</p>
<p><b>1. We want to start an Amazon workers newsletter</b></p>
<p>We have lots of translated material of interviews with Amazon workers in Germany, Poland and India, as well as knowing comrades who work in, and have direct contact with, Amazon workers. We could turn this into an (irregular) 2-sided newsletter for Amazon workers in the UK. Polish comrades have set up a small section of the Workers Initiative (IP) syndicalist union inside the warehouse in Poznan, which is now the site of Europe&rsquo;s biggest Amazon warehouse. It was built to undermine workers at struggling Amazon warehouses across Germany. Workers from Germany and Poland recently had a meeting together to discuss coordinating their efforts:</p>
<p><a href="https://libcom.org/news/cross-border-amazon-workers-meeting-30092015#" target="_blank">http://libcom.org/news/cross-border-amazon-workers-meeting-30092015#</a></p>
<p>And at the the recent meeting about transnational strikes in Poznan earlier this month we heard about the idea of Amazon workers organising a bus caravan through Europe.</p>
<p>As of yet, we have no contact with Amazon workers/militants in England who could participate in international meetings or coordinations like these ones. We think this newsletter would be a good step towards this. It would also let workers know what is happening at other Amazon warehouses, which may encourage their own activity e.g. other workers&rsquo; experiences of union struggles such as those being led by the <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">ver.di union in Germany; how workers there don&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;countdown&rsquo; on their scanner/watch, which has relieved some of their work pressure; or the overtime slow-down strike in Poznan in support of the workers on strike in Germany (they had been ordered by management to work overtime as they supply for the German market, so essentially the workers in Poland were refusing to be scabs).</span></p>
<p>Would any of you be interested in working on this together? Essentially this would mean co-writing and/or distributing the paper outside Amazon warehouses when shifts start and/or finish. Because we are based in London, we are not immediately near any Amazon warehouses but could also come from time to time to help out. You could build on these links in whatever ways you had the capacity for within your local. At the moment it just seems a shame that we have all these materials and contacts that would make a great newsletter and they&rsquo;re not being put to use!</p>
<p>We made a list of Amazon warehouse locations below [1] so if your local has the time, capacity, energy and will to focus on these workers, or at least start something and then see how things go, get in touch and we can discuss in more detail.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried that your local not having the longer-term resources to support workers if the newsletter does prove to be a catalyst for workers wanting to organise, then let&rsquo;s discuss how this could be overcome.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 4:56pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/liverpool-iww-spread-message-that-claimant-advocacy-is-not-a-crime/" target="_blank">Liverpool IWW</a>, October 12, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="180" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/scousewobs.jpg" alt="" />This afternoon, members and supporters of Liverpool IWW held an information picket outside the town centre job centre, on Williamson Square. We are one of several IWW groups and other activist organisations holding demonstrations at job centres this week. Scottish Unemployed Workers Network called for solidarity with claimant advocate Tony Cox, who faces court in Forfar tomorrow on the ludicrous charges of threatening behaviour, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/901080539929227/" target="_blank">refusing to give his name and address and resisting arrest</a>. He was arrested at an Arbroath job centre last January, whilst representing a highly vulnerable unemployed woman.</p>
<p>Scottish Unemployed Workers Network assert that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that this case highlights the climate of fear that is evident within many job centres, but that it is not only benefit claimants that are treated with contempt. Welfare advisors are also being subjected to bullying and intimidation, as in the recent case of Mike Vallance at High Riggs Job Centre, when they attempt to represent, often highly vulnerable, benefit claimants. The SUWN will resist any and all attempts to curb the rights of welfare and citizen advocates to represent the unemployed, and we ask you to join us in our fight to ensure that ADVOCACY IS NOT A CRIME.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Liverpool today, we distributed info provided by<a href="http://www.edinburghagainstpoverty.org.uk/node/32" target="_blank"> Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty</a>, backing up with legal statements the fact that &lsquo;advocacy is not a crime&rsquo;. Claimants visiting the job centre took our advice enthusiastically, and were generally pleased that someone was taking a stand against the Department for Work and Pensions, and the bullying regime inside job centres. Our social networking presence also got a number of likes and follows during the picket.</p>
<p>In fact, the response was so positive that we will soon begin a regular series of job centre info distribution pickets, offering advice, encouragement and solidarity to claimants &ndash; who represent some of the most vulnerable elements of the working class.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/30/2015 - 9:11pm</p>
<p><b>By Angry Language</b><b> - <a target="_blank" href="https://libcom.org/blog/language-workers-got-tallents-27092015">LibCom.Org</a>, September 27, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/180x187xEWIU620.jpg.pagespeed.ic.fpDvhmbgjh/" />Ultimately, we were forced to go down the legal route. That means that IWW members at LSSE only got the legal minimum, despite our belief that the callous mistreatment we suffered while at the school entitled us to further compensation. In any case, we got more than Craig had ever planned to give us.</p>
<p>We're proud to say that in our effort to make Craig pay up, the workers ran militant and well-organised campaign. We occupied the school. We forced Craig <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/struggle-leicester-square-school-english-story-so-far-15012015" target="_blank">to resign as a governor of the Bancroft School</a> and to <a href="http://asparagusconsulting.com/" target="_blank">shut down the website of another one of his business interests, Asparagus Consulting</a>. We <a href="../../../../content/callout-24-hour-email-campaign-target-wage-stealing-boss/" target="_blank">hassled him at his residents' association</a>. We held numerous <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/picket-leicester-square-school-english-21012015" target="_blank">pickets and protests</a> in Leicester Square and at the <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/lsse-struggle-next-stop-drapers-09022015" target="_blank">Drapers' Guild</a>, where Craig is a member of some note &ndash; actions which did not go unnoticed by senior officers of the organisation.</p>
<p>To any other workers who may ever have the misfortune to work for Craig, we have a message for you: if he mistreats you in any way, you've got the support of the Angry Language Brigade and the IWW. It doesn't matter if you're a language school worker or not; if Craig's your boss, we got your back.</p>
<p>And let this be a message to any future would-be business partners: Craig Tallents is a toxic asset. Besides his consistently underhanded business practices, he's got two organisations who are ready and willing to picket and protest anywhere he sets up shop.</p>
<p>Jon Bigger, the IWW caseworker who helped the workers, said &ldquo;this case was a good example of a boss trying to hide when the going got tough. Future workers and business partners of Craig Tallents will no doubt take note of his actions. Bosses should take note of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those who've followed the dispute, one of the key issues was that Craig had illegally and intentionally misclassified a number of teachers as self-employed. This meant that when Craig shut down the school, he thought he could do so without paying those teachers thousands of pounds in holiday and notice pay.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you've been misclassified &ndash; <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/tackling-uks-“freelance”-tefl-scandal-18112014" target="_blank">a major problem in language schools</a> &ndash; you have recourse. Raise it collectively with your workmates or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/status-customer-service-team" target="_blank">contact HMRC</a> who can contact your employer to make them sort out their records and pay you any back pay to which you may be entitled. HMRC can be contacted anonymously, but it's probably best if you have someone like a union rep call on your behalf.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 09/20/2015 - 3:29pm</p>
<p><b><strong>By Dorsett IWW</strong></b><b> - <a href="https://dorsetiww.wordpress.com/2015/09/17/there-will-be-no-unpaid-workers-at-the-co-op/" target="_blank">Dorsett IWW</a>, September 17, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img width="400" height="250" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/coop1.jpg" alt="" />Dorset IWW General Members&rsquo; Branch is pleased to announce that our dispute with a Bournemouth outlet of the Co-operative has been settled amicably. We have a verbal assurance from local management who are USDAW members, that they have no wish to exploit unpaid workers on their premises, and that their connection with &lsquo;Prospects&rsquo; has been severed. We congratulate them on their principled decision and affirm our commitment to defeat the government&rsquo;s work programme and end unpaid labour. </p>
<p>Nationally however, the situation is less clear; we have had sight of a Co-op internal document that sets out the parameters of their unpaid work experience programme. Whilst it insists that placements must be voluntary and offer meaningful experience, we note that vulnerable adults are being conscripted who may not be fully aware of their rights. It&rsquo;s highly likely some of them will not be able to make an informed decision and/or will get browbeaten by jobcentre staff with targets to meet. Once they are on the scheme if they leave they may be deemed to have made themselves intentionally unemployed, and be sanctioned. Lastly of course, however you dress it up, it&rsquo;s unpaid labour. How long does it take to assess a person&rsquo;s suitability for working in a grocer&rsquo;s shop? A week, two? Why then should a national chain not speculate a fortnight&rsquo;s minimum wage to find out?</p>
