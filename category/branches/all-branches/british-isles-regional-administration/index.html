<p><strong>By Edinburgh Wobbly - <a target="_blank" href="https://iwwscotland.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/anti-racist-message-from-clydeside-iww-st-andrews-day-march-2016/">IWW Scotland</a>, November 25, 2016</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/iww-no-borders_0_0.jpg" align="right" alt="" />Now more than ever we need organising that is:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong>anti-racist</strong></li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong>anti-fascist</strong></li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong> internationalist.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory in the US elections, following the recent Brexit vote, creates a whole new political climate in the West.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, working class people have suffered a massive attack with the loss of traditional industries, in favour of low-paid service jobs, and the destruction of the labour movement.&nbsp; The neoliberal model that was created was based on growth through the financial sector and it led to the 2008 economic crisis.</p>
<p>When the UK government bailed out the banks it forced us to shoulder the cost through austerity, cutting vital services and targetting the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The left responded to post-crisis austerity first through mass protest around the world, and then the rise of several populist movements seeking parliamentary power.&nbsp; One by one, they have been defeated or have so far been unable to provide any real challenge.</p>
<p>And now things are about to get worse.</p>
<p>There are many uncertainties &ndash; what will Brexit mean? how will Trump govern?&nbsp; What we can expect in the UK is that austerity will go on, even if the aim is no longer to cut the deficit, and real wages &nbsp;will continue to decline.</p>
<p>Both Brexit and Trump&rsquo;s presidency are a victory for the far right.&nbsp; Immigration to the UK will be curbed and border controls will become even more cruel.&nbsp; Racism against ethnic minorities will be reinforced by the tabloid media as the nationalist dream fails to appear.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that <strong>migrants don&rsquo;t lower wages &ndash; bosses do</strong>.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 11/30/2015 - 9:15pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Bristol IWW - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/the-iww-grassroots-direct-action-unionism-in-5-easy-steps/">Bristol IWW</a>, November 30, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="250" height="250" align="left" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/cropped-cropped-middle-proper.jpg" />1<b>. </b><strong>You&rsquo;re having problems at your workplace.</strong><b> </b>You may not be getting your correct pay, or your correct sickness pay, or holiday entitlement, but you are unsure what to do because you haven&rsquo;t got anything written, or you do but it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to you and nobody has bothered to explain it to you.</p>
<p><strong>You want to do something about it,</strong> but you don&rsquo;t really know what your rights are and what the law says. You may be bullied, harassed or intimidated by colleagues and/or managers, and feel isolated and depressed. Or, perhaps, you may actually like your job, get on with your colleagues and not have any problems at all with it. You may be unemployed, or a student or a retired person. You may think you have nothing in common with people in different circumstances, but we think you do: <strong>we think you should all join the IWW</strong>. In the IWW we believe that whether you are in work or not right now, you are still part of a society based on paid work and as such you will be affected by it at some point or other.</p>
<p><strong>In the IWW we believe you don&rsquo;t join the union only when you have a problem</strong> that you need an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; to fix; we think you should join anyway because being in a grassroots union is a key element of being involved and engaged with the world you live in. We think everyone has the right to take control and power back over their lives and work. We think everyone has the right to learn about employment rights and legislation and <strong>become their own &ldquo;expert&rdquo;</strong>. We become &ldquo;experts&rdquo; through formal training courses in casework and organising, but mostly we learn informally, by sharing knowledge and skills and supporting each other. We are grassroots, we are democratic, and we are fighters.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fightingcat.jpeg"><img width="253" height="300" align="right" alt="fightingcat" src="../../../../sites/default/files/fightingcat-253x300.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-402 alignright" /></a>2.<b> </b><strong>You are a member now</strong><b>,</b> and suddenly you do have problems in your workplace. Your manager may have decided to change your terms and conditions and demanded you to accept. You may notice you are not getting paid all the hours you are working. You may be under a lot of stress and pressure at work and have to take time off work sick because of it. <strong>Who you gonna call? The Wobblies!</strong> You arrange to meet with one of our caseworkers and go through things with them. You finally have someone to talk to who will listen to you and give you guidance and support, help you understand the law and what to do.</p>
<p><strong>In the IWW we believe in EMPOWERMENT not delegation: </strong>we don&rsquo;t do things FOR you, we do things WITH you. Once you have a clearer idea of the options available to you, it is up to you to decide what steps to take, knowing that the IWW will have your back. The IWW can help you in many different ways, from standard workplace procedures such as grievances and disciplinaries to more complex casework such as supporting you to take your case to an Employment Tribunal if appropriate. All these words and expression may mean nothing to you at the beginning, and you may feel overwhelmed by it all, but slowly, with the help of your IWW rep, you will become your own &ldquo;expert&rdquo;. You will start to understand, learn and feel empowered: <strong>knowledge is power.</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>So, your case is ongoing and we are following the standard procedures. </strong>We may be supporting to write formal demands to your employer, attending meetings alongside you, helping you to find a good solicitor, advocating on your behalf with your employer or other organisations (such as ACAS).</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes though things don&rsquo;t work,</strong> maybe because your employer is not responding, or because the nature of your employment is such that standard procedures are not appropriate. So, what happens then? Simple: we use direct action. <strong>We get together, because together we are stronger,</strong> and we get your case &ldquo;out there&rdquo;. We may ask people to call or write to your employer and complain about they way they are treating you. We may ask for a boycott of the company you are working for. We may get in touch with local and national press to publicise your case. We may hold a demonstration at your workplace until your employer meets your demands.</p>
<p>This is what we have done recently for one of our members who had her wages withheld by the cafe she worked at. And just in case you are wondering, <strong>yes, it did work:</strong> direct action does get the goods! <a href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/">Read our report about it &ldquo;What&rsquo;s outrageous? Unpaid wages!&rdquo;.</a></p>
<p>4.<strong> All is over now,</strong> your employer has seen sense and you are in the pub celebrating with the Wobblies and your friends. You will feel knackered. You will also feel thrilled, energised, inspired. You will look at yourself in the mirror and know you have had the guts to stand up for your rights, no matter how stressful it has been. You have learned that you are not alone, and you will never feel alone again when standing up to your boss because the IWW will always have your back. <strong>So, what next?</strong> Well, if you haven&rsquo;t already done so, you could complete our training courses in casework and organising. You will now have the knowledge and skills to support people in the same situation, and you will have a personal understanding of how it feels to have a dispute with your employer and WIN. <strong>The sky is our only limit, for us Wobblies! </strong></p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/19/2015 - 5:38pm</p>
<p><strong>By Communications Officer - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/" target="_blank">Bristol IWW</a>, November 14, 2015</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/DSCN1107-300x225.jpg" alt="" />Fellow Wobblies and supporters, Bristol Communications Officer here to report on the wet but very successful solidarity demo held this morning in Bristol outside Cafe Amore!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We organised the demo in solidarity with Fellow Worker Bonny, who worked at Cafe Amore for a while and was not paid the full wages she was owed after quitting. Bristol IWW union representative assisted her in writing a demand letter to the cafe&rsquo;s boss, which Bonny then delivered by hand a week ago accompanied by fellow Wobblies. During the week, the boss paid her some of the money she was owed but not all of it, and didn&rsquo;t provide a clear explanation as to why he couldn&rsquo;t pay the whole amount, and when he would do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So, on we went this Saturday to hold a solidarity demo demanding the cafe&rsquo;s boss to pay Bonny her wages, as well as to highlight the bad practices that Cafe Amore use on their staff &ndash; unpaid trials, underpaying migrant staff, and forced unpaid overtime. </strong>Despite the relentless rain, we had a very successful demonstration attended by around 30 people, with many members and supporters of the IWW, and members of Bristol SolNet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before the start of the demo, Bonny went in the cafe accompanied by her union rep and other members of the IWW to renew her demand and hand out flyers to customers. The boss was very aggressive towards them, making excuses as to why he hadn&rsquo;t been able to pay Bonny&rsquo;s full wages, and being very vague as to when he would pay her the remaining amount. He then went on to tell another IWW member who was trying to talk to customers to &ldquo;get out of here or I&rsquo;ll beat you up&rdquo; in front of all the customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We stood outside the cafe for an hour, handing out flyers and singing songs in support of Bonny, and having lots of fun Wobbly-style! Lots of passers-by stopped to ask us what was going on and expressed interest and support for Bonny and what we were doing. But, Cafe Amore&rsquo;s boss still hasn&rsquo;t paid Bonny all the money she&rsquo;s owed! Bristol IWW will carry on holding weekly solidarity demos outside Cafe Amore until Bonny&rsquo;s paid up all the money she&rsquo;s owed. <strong>Keep checking our blog and, especially, our Facebook page and Twitter feed (links on the right) and, if Bonny still doesn&rsquo;t get paid, see you on Saturday 21 November at 12pm outside Cafe Amore</strong> (which is on Nelson Street, next to Holland &amp; Barrett). Or, as we put it today in our chants: Pay Bonny her money and we&rsquo;ll go away / Pay Bonny her money or we&rsquo;re here to stay!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Do you also work in the bar &amp; hospitality sector &ndash; bars, pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, catering, etc? Does any of this sound familiar to you? The IWW has just launched a campaign to support and organise workers in these businesses. You can read our statement here:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/iww-bar-hospitality-workers-campaign/"> statement</a>.</strong> <strong>We have also written an article on local paper &ldquo;The Bristol Cable&rdquo; highlighting the issues of bar &amp; hospitality workers in Bristol. You can read it here:<a target="_blank" href="http://thebristolcable.org/2015/11/is-your-waiter-fair-trade-and-ethically-sourced/#"> article.</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>If Bonny&rsquo;s situation sounds familiar to you, and you need help and support to stand up to bully bosses who don&rsquo;t pay wages and treat their workers like doormats, email us at <em>bristol@iww.org.uk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are a grassroots union that uses direct action methods to support workers to fight back for their rights. This is what we can offer you: training to know Employment Law and (where possible) use it to get what you want; training to represent your Fellow Workers in grievance and disciplinary meetings; training to organise your co-workers so you can speak as one voice, and get more influence over what goes on at work; and, finally, TRAINING TO WIN &ndash; better terms and conditions, better pay, and less bullying from your boss!</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 11/08/2015 - 2:23pm</p>
<p><strong>By Dek Keenan - <a target="_blank" href="https://usilive.org/opinions/wobbling-to-victory/">Union Solidarity International</a>, November 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="240" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/IWGB-3-Cosas.jpg" alt="" />In recent years, new or rediscovered forms of worker self-organisation have begun to appear &ndash; and often in the most unlikely of places.</p>
<p>Small independent unions, using a combination of often audacious direct action tactics combined with innovative campaign strategies are bringing victories to some of the most marginalised and precarious groups of workers. Punching way above their weight, these dynamic new (and some not so new) unions are fighting to win and organising with few or no full-time officials and on shoestring budgets.</p>
<p>Are they the work of anarchist wreckers, alien to the traditions of the labour movement, or do they offer a way out of the impasse that our movement finds itself in?</p>
<p>In London, new unions such as the United Voices of the World (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uvwunion.org.uk/">UVW</a>) and Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (<a target="_blank" href="http://iwgb.org.uk/">IWGB</a>) have been at the forefront of precarious, out-sourced and greatly migrant labour struggles. Recent high profile fights for the Living Wage, for sick pay and the reinstatement of union activists at the Barbican and at Sotheby&rsquo;s auction house have brought the UVW into the media spotlight.</p>
<p>The first signs in the UK of this &lsquo;new unionism&rsquo; were seen in 2011 when the Industrial Workers of the World (<a target="_blank" href="https://iww.org.uk/">IWW</a>), the famous &lsquo;Wobblies&rsquo;, organised a Branch for cleaners in London, recruiting dissatisfied members of Unite associated with the Latin American Workers Association (LAWA).</p>
<p>This Branch built on the existing community of solidarity in the LAWA and, through the establishment of workers&rsquo; advice clinics, language classes and much aggressive outreach by unpaid activists, expanded beyond the Latin American community to other groups of cleaners searching for an effective voice at work. London Living Wage victories at Canary Wharf and elsewhere followed, heightening the profile of the IWW and paving the way for subsequent initiatives from the UVW and IWGB.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/07/2015 - 1:48pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/victory-as-people-power-forces-liverpool-council-homeless-fines-u-turn/" target="_blank">Liverpool IWW</a>, November 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="213" align="right" src="https://liverpooliww.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/homelessness.jpg" alt="" />Liverpool Industrial Workers of the World unreservedly welcomes the sensational decision of Liverpool City Council to scrap their consultation on plans to fine the homeless a whole eight days ahead of its planned conclusion. We are delighted that homeless people now no longer face this added threat of being penalised for the social crime of homelessness.</p>
<p>Like Oxford, Hackney and Wycombe authority before them, Mayor Joe Anderson&rsquo;s council has floated the idea, hoping it will go through, only to be overwhelmed by the public backlash against it. In doing so, the council has shown the potential of mass working class action to make changes in the world. Anderson and Liverpool Labour have given way on this one issue, because it risked jeopardising the rest of their austerity agenda.</p>
<p>Only yesterday morning, Liverpool IWW started a Facebook event page proposing a demonstration against the homeless fines. Within hours, scores had pledged they would attend, hundreds of people had been invited, and many were leaving comments on the page. Some raised their own demands, such as Joe Anderson paying back the &pound;89,000 of public money he received from the council for legal advice on a private matter (he&rsquo;d been sacked by a school he did no work for).</p>
<p>The homeless fines threatened to be a &lsquo;straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back&rsquo;. When asked by the media for a reaction in response to Liverpool IWW&rsquo;s press release, the council retreated a step. The council&rsquo;s deployment of pro-cuts Councillor Rachael O&rsquo;Byrne to the Facebook event page confirms this.</p>
<p>Liverpool Labour&rsquo;s explanation for the whole affair beggars belief. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/news-and-comment/plans-to-fine-liverpool-beggars-1000-scrapped">Liverpool Confidential</a> , &ldquo;Anderson intervened to have the scheme scrapped after hearing about the proposals yesterday [Wednesday]&rdquo;. Councillor Steve Munby went on, &ldquo;The proposal was not a decision by the council cabinet, but was drawn up by officers following complaints from residents and the BID [Business Improvement District].&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are charitable to Anderson, it still looks devastatingly bad. He is the mayor of the city, he is paid a large salary, and he dines with the greedy business owners who were pushing this scheme on a very regular basis. If the official story is to be believed, he was somehow unaware of the council consultation nearly a month after it began on 9th October. He is therefore totally out of touch with the affairs of his own council, and totally incompetent.</p>
<p>The far more likely explanation, of course, is that Anderson, O&rsquo;Byrne, Munby and colleagues are simply lying through their teeth.</p>
<p>Liverpool IWW will continue to fight for the interests of all working class people in the local area, so we can guarantee that this is not the last that Mayor Anderson and all his bloodsoaked poverty pimps will hear of us.</p>
