<p><b>By Gustavo Arellano - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ocweekly.com/2006-06-08/news/gunkist-oranges/full/"><em>Orange County Weekly</em></a>, June 8, 2006<br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<h3><strong><img width="204" height="320" align="right" alt="" src="http://ecology.iww.org/images/gunkist-oranges.1699729.40.jpg" />BITE ON</strong></h3>
<p>Seventy years ago this week, Orange County&rsquo;s most brutally suppressed strike began with a bite.</p>
<p>On June 15, 1936, at the break of dawn, about 200 Mexican women gathered in Anaheim to preach the gospel of <em>huelga</em>&mdash;strike. Four days earlier, about 2,500 Mexican <em>naranjeros</em> representing more than half of Orange County&rsquo;s crucial citrus-picking force dropped their clippers, bags and ladders to demand higher wages, better working conditions and the right to unionize.</p>
<p>The women spread across the groves of Anaheim, the heart of citrus country, urging workers to let the fruit hang. Twenty Anaheim police officers confronted the women; they refused to disperse. At some point there was an altercation, and 29-year-old Placentia resident Virginia Torres bit the arm of Anaheim police officer Roger Sherman. Police arrested Torres, along with 30-year-old Epifania Marquez, who tried to yank a strikebreaker&mdash;a scab&mdash;from a truck by grabbing onto his suspenders.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the Fort Sumter of Orange County&mdash;newspaper accounts say only that Torres and Marquez received jail sentences of 60 and 30 days, respectively. But Orange County responded with an organized wrath years in the planning. Growers enlisted the local chapters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion to guard fields. They evicted families of strikers from their company-owned houses. The English-language press became a bulletin board for the growers&mdash;<em>The Santa Ana Register</em>, for instance, described the 200 Mexican women in Anaheim as &ldquo;Amazons with fire of battle in their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Orange County Sheriff Logan Jackson deputized citrus orchard guards and provided them with steel helmets, shotguns and ax handles. The newly minted cops began arresting strikers en masse, more than 250 by strike&rsquo;s end. When that didn&rsquo;t stop the strike, they reported workers to federal immigration authorities. When that didn&rsquo;t work, out came the guns and clubs. Tear gas blossomed in the groves. Mobs of citrus farmers and their supporters attacked under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>What county residents tried to dismiss as a fruitless strike quickly escalated into a full-fledged civil war in which race and class were inseparable. The Mexicans of Orange County, the county&rsquo;s historical source of cheap labor, were finally asking for better working conditions; their <em>gabacho</em> overlords wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. And so both sides fought for a month until the lords of Orange County won.</p>
<p>Wonder why Orange County trembles whenever its Mexicans protest? Welcome to the Citrus War of 1936, the most important event in Orange County history you&rsquo;ve never heard of.</p>

<p><b><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWdrawing.smlr.preview.gif" alt="" />Whereas</b> increasing numbers of working class and dispossessed people in the United States have begun to meet face to face to proclaim their opposition to economic injustice and define their interests in democratic popular assemblies, autonomous from political parties, as part of the Occupy Movement, which resonates deeply with the IWW's traditions and principles, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> millions of working class and dispossessed people around the world, but especially in Northern Africa and Western Asia, have been organizing themselves to overthrow the governments that enforce the capitalist and neocolonial domination and exploitation they have resisted for generations, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> the IWW has stood since its founding in 1905 for the proposition that:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.<br />
<br />
Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.&quot; and</blockquote>
<p><b>Whereas</b> since 2006 the tradition of the movement for the rights of migrant workers in the U.S. has been to mobilize themselves and their allies for mass actions on May 1 to disrupt the functioning of the economic system and political discourse of the 1%, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> every year May Day is celebrated globally as International Workers Day to commemorate the struggle of the international working class to emancipate itself through the class war over the centuries, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> May Day 1890 was proclaimed to be an international day of working class protest by the Second International against the repression of the 8 Hour Day movement in the U.S. where 8 mostly immigrant anarchist labor organizers were arrested, with 4 being hanged and one committing suicide the night before the hangings, after an unknown person threw a bomb at police who were repressing a protest against police brutality in Haymarket Square in Chicago, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> the Los Angeles branch of the IWW welcomes this opportunity to organize alongside OccupyLA and other participants in the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition to help the working class build the skills, the community, and the combativeness necessary to defend ourselves, our elders, and the generations to come from the global threats of austerity, exploitation, imperialism and ecocide.</p>
<p><b>Be it resolved that</b> the LA Branch of the IWW endorses the May 1, 2012 General Strike and commits to work as part of the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition by conducting trainings and participating in actions in the lead up to May 1.</p>

Fellow Workers,<br />
<br />
I am a Wobbly in IU 650 who was trying to organize my
workplace, here in San Diego.  I was working at a  group home for children with
Severe Emotional Disorders run by a nonprofit called New Alternatives
Incorporated. I started talking  to my coworkers on my shift about taking
collective action when I observed  it to be an  environment of intimidation and
favoritism.  <br />
<br />
A former Coworker told me it was standard procedure to
harass employees into quiting  at New Alternatives Inc. because they didn't want
to  pay unemployment.  I know when a friend of mine quit without a two week
notice the management called her up two weeks later yelling at her saying she
would not get a good reference from them.â€ <br />
<br />
I also heard coworkers
from another program stating when they wrote a letter about the problems with a
Shift Supervisor to the Program Manager, the Program Manager gave that letter to
the Shift Supervisor, who met with the signatories individually and scolded
them. This same shift supervisor once said that the employees of her shift
should not expect a break during their eight hour shift.  <br />
<br />
I had also 
talked to an employee who had worked a double shifts which amounted to
double-time hours, in California double time is anything in the excess of twelve
hours in a shift,  and distribute them throughout the week so he would not be
paid for double-time.  These are just some of the incidents as I had been the
target of harassment as well.  <br />
<br />
In response to several incidents I began
drafting petitions and distributing amongst my shift. The first petition letter,
which was sent to our  Program Manger and courtesy copied to the Executive
Director, dealt with a letter of expectation that we as shift singled us out.
Three of us signed this letter. The result of the meeting is we were able to
meet the Assistant Executive Director who heard our grievances but was sort of
standoffish about the whole incident.  The effect was we stood by our decision
not to sign and the whole incident dropped off the map.<br />

Before sunrise on a Monday morning, outside a sterile office park in
Compton, a convoy of small, beat-up cars, none of them newer than 1995, arrives
at the offices of the trucking firm Calko Speedline. One by one, the car's
drivers emerge, ranchera and mariachi and est?s escuchando a Piol?n por la
ma?ana! competing from their radios. They buy coffee from the taco truck that
follows them in, and assemble in small groups, huddled in circles among their
big rigs - hulking red, green, blue and white mammoths lined up along the curb,
their diesel-burning engines grumbling into action one by one.
</div>
<br />
<div>
The drivers' day of waiting begins.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;My name's Chicho. Everybody knows me. You can ask anyone, 'Do you know
Chicho?' and he'll say yes.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
Chicho, born Hernan Robleto, is short, round, nearly bald and, when he
speaks, energetically animated. His English is nearly indistinguishable from his
Spanish; sometimes, while listening to him, it's possible to lose any conscious
sense of which language he's speaking. At the Calko office, he paces among the
various groups while office personnel inside quietly field calls from terminal
operators at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach about ship traffic and
schedules; later, they'll give each of the men directions to their first load of
the day, a container of goods destined for an intermediate shipping facility
somewhere inland or farther down the coast, where it will be transported still
farther, to distribution centers all over the country, by truck or
train.

<br />
300 troquer@s based in South Gate and Mira Loma went on strike against HUDD et al.
<br />
These workers were mostly young latino migrants with a very visible
participation of women truck drivers. Most of them had been in the
harbor about 5 years with maybe as few as 10% going back to the CWA
days of 1996 and only a handful that were present during the 1980s.
