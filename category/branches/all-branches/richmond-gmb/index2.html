</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/27/2010 - 10:31am</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/globes/ISC.jpg" align="right" /><b>By: Kenneth Yates x370724</b></p>
<p>A place called Shockoe Bottom in Richmond, Virginia was once the center of the African slave trade in North America. However if you were to visit this area you would never know it. Beneath the night clubs, condominiums, office buildings, and streets lies a history grossly repressed by capitalist appetites for commercial development.</p>
<p>One hidden piece of history in particular lies beneath a parking lot publicly owned and utilized by the Virginia Commonwealth University & Medical College of Virginia staff and students.</p>
<p>In 1992 local historian and author Elizabeth Cann Kambourian, while researching for a book about a local slave rebellion leader named Gabriel, discovered something. Around 1800, inspired by the Haitian Revolution which was in full swing at the time, Gabriel plotted one of the most organized slave revolts in United States history. The plan was for hundreds of enslaved Africans, free Blacks and a few whites to to enter the city of Richmond, take the governor hostage and demand the abolition of slavery in Virginia. The revolt, however, was crushed after an intense 100 year storm flooded the area, making it impossible for Gabriel and his army to enter the city.</p>
<p>With information given by one of Gabriel's collaborators, the then Richmond Governor James Monroe formed a militia to hunt down Gabriel and his co-conspirators. Gabriel was eventually captured, tried and, on Oct. 10, 1800, executed at the town gallows, located in what was then called the Burial Ground for Negroes. At least 25 of his comrades met the same fate, either at the same site or in surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The burial ground was retired sometime around 1810, after hundreds, perhaps thousands of enslaved Africans had been buried there. The exact number is unknown. Before long the burial ground itself fell into obscurity, eventually buried beneath 10-20 feet of filler as the land took on many other uses over the years.</p>
<p>Kambourian discovered an old Richmond City map placing the African Burial Ground just north of 15th & Broad Street. That area is now partially covered by Interstate 95, with the remaining portion of the Burial Ground buried beneath a parking lot utilized by both VCU & MCV staff and students. The exact boundaries are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice & Equality have been fighting to reclaim this sacred ground from its present desecration. VCU & the City of Richmond have been aware of the history surrounding the Burial Ground since its discovery in 1992, however they have to this day done nothing to preserve and respect the dead residing there.</p>
<p>The Defenders have initiated an on-line letter writing campaign directed at VCU President Michael Rao, Richmond City Mayor Dwight C. Jones, & Virginia Governor Bob McDonell, demanding that they "End VCU / MCV Parking on Richmond's African Burial Ground."</p>

<a href="../../../../node/5213/" rel="bookmark">Richmond, Va - Sustainable East End Development Suggestion for East End Vision Re-development.</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 10/01/2010 - 6:16am</p>
<p>The Richmond IWW responded to a plan that will re-develop a historical part of Richmond's East End whose residents are majority working class and African American. The East End Vision is made up of a group of professionals &amp; city officials who held a five day charrette (town hall meeting) in June to allow for the community to give their input on what the community should look like. </p>
<p>We found that residents were concerned about possible gentrification and the overwhelming influx of middle class residents that would be attracted to such a development. Sustainable East End Development was formed by the Richmond IWW and local residents to help unify the voices of the affected residents and ensure that no one is displaced. </p>
<p>Another iniative the Richmond IWW is working on is creating a Richmond Renters Union to help residents organize and politicize themselves around the issue of gentrification. </p>

<p>Dear Mayor Dwight C. Jones, Council Persons and CEO John M. Lewis Jr.,</p>
<p>In regards to Councilpersons Tyler &amp; Conner's paper calling for a 'GRTC Transit Study Task Force' [Ord. No. 2010-173], the Richmond Transit Riders Union understands that a similar study has already been presented. We are concerned that another such study would be redundant.</p>
<p>The Greater Richmond Transit Company's 387 page 'Comprehensive Operations Analysis' [ http://ridegrtc.com/images/GRTC_Final_COA.pdf ] was conducted over a three year period from 2004 – 2007 outlining many strategies, trends, regional demographics, and grievances taken directly from the ridership.</p>
<p>Councilperson Tyler stated during the September 23, 2010 'Governmental Operations Committee' meeting that he had not yet read this analysis.</p>
<p>GRTC's study already contains valuable information and suggestions, even possible solutions that would help to increase ridership and move GRTC towards a more equitable and efficient public transportation system.</p>
