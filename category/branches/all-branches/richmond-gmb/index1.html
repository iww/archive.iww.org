</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 08/18/2011 - 2:12am</p>
<p><img width="300" height="223" align="right" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/foodservwork_1.jpg" />An &lsquo;<strong>Unfair Labor Practice&rsquo; </strong>has been filed with the<strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a></strong> against <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://crossroadsrva.com/">Crossroads Coffee &amp; Ice Cream</a></strong> in Richmond, Virginia for a violation of an employee&rsquo;s right to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection, as found in<strong> Sec. 7. [&sect; 157.]</strong> of the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a></strong>.</p>
<p>On Jun 8, 2011, Holly L., a member of the <strong>Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)</strong>, was terminated after sending an email, a common form of communication, to management and staff. &nbsp;The email addressed Crossroads owner Will Herring&rsquo;s failure to close and lock up the establishment, forcing employees to wait for his arrival well after the end of their shift. This incident is one in a pattern of disrespectful behavior by Mr. Herring towards employees. While individual attempts were made by employees to address the problem, their failure led to the decision that collective action was the logical step towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>Our intention is not to suggest a boycott of the establishment; rather, we want to join concerned workers and customers in sending a message to management and other Richmond employers that exploitation will not be tolerated. Members of the Industrial Workers of the World firmly believe that all employers, large and small, must respect the rights of its employees &mdash; including the right to an open and safe environment where employee concerns can be addressed without the fear of retaliation. If this simple demand can not be met, the working class will respond as necessary.</p>

<a href="../../../../content/iww-sends-solidarity-workers-danville-virginia-ikeaswedwood-factory/" rel="bookmark">IWW Sends Solidarity to Workers at Danville, Virginia IKEA/Swedwood Factory</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 07/02/2011 - 2:59am</p>
<p>Dear Fellow Workers of the IKEA/Swedwood Factory in Danville, Virginia,</p>
<p>The Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) would like to offer our solidarity and support for your recent decision to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pslweb.org/liberationnews/news/workers-at-virginia-ikea.html">seek union representation</a> with the <a href="http://www.goiam.org.php/imail/latest/8893-iam-files-for-election-at-swedwood-ikea-plant" target="_blank">Wood Workers Division of the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers</a>.</p>
<p>The State of Virginia has a long history of attracting companies that count on weak labor laws, which without a union can leave workers vulnerable to exploitation. This is why, more than ever, it is important to encourage workers in all industries to unite in class struggle. With an organized working class we can build a labor movement that successfully demands dignity and respect, not only at our respective workplaces, but also in our communities.</p>
<p>Every time we organize and form a union, the power of the working class is magnified. It will be through education and organization followed by direct action that an emancipated working class will emerge. United, we can realize not only increased wages, better and safer working conditions, health care, and paid vacations, but also, quality union jobs, better schools, social services, and the enforcement of civil rights, for all workers.</p>
<p>In the coming days, as you weigh the choice to elect union representation, know that in a &quot;right to work&quot; state such as Virginia, unions can not collectively bargain for &quot;union security&quot;. This means there would be a contract provision negotiated whereby agreeing that all workers who receive economic benefits of union representation also share in the cost of maintaining their union.</p>
<p>In a &quot;right to work&quot; state, workers can &quot;choose&quot; not to pay into the union, escaping their financial obligation to support their union and fellow workers, pay nothing, and still receive all the benefits. The employing class of course supports the &quot;right to work&quot; law because it does for them what they can't do themselves, financially drain unions, so they don't have the resources required to protect their fellow workers and further organize.</p>
<p>So, vote union, pay your dues, and demand democracy in the workplace. As the labor movement grows, so will our strength, and ability to demand the eventual abolition of the class and wage system, effectively removing the means of production from the clutches of the bosses, and placing those means into the hands of the workers, where it belongs.</p>
<p>In Solidarity,<br />
Richmond Industrial Workers of the World</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/04/2010 - 2:33pm</p>
<p>For more information and complete back story refer to: http://monroecampaign.wordpress.com/</p>
<p>Dear City &amp; Monroe Park Advisory Councils,</p>
<p>“There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people,” states the beginning of our labor union’s preamble. We, the Richmond members of the Industrial Workers of the World, feel that the renovation plans for Monroe Park, as they currently stand, will serve to exacerbate hunger and want in Richmond. We, as concerned citizens of the Richmond area and hardened activists and organizers, will not let this issue slip by without a struggle.</p>
<p>These renovation plans include fencing off the entire park for several months, and up to a year, denying access to all who depend on it, including the services provided there. This translates to the homeless being forced out of the park and dispersed into the VCU and Greater Richmond community, without concern for where they might await refuge in otherwise nearby shelters or sustenance via various meal programs that congregate there.</p>
