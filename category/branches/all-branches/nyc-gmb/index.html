</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 01/22/2018 - 7:52pm</p>
<p><strong>By Stardust Family Unted - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/new-york-wobbly-waiters-stage-sip-demand-iww-recognition/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, January 17, 2018 </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This following report and video comes from the Stardust Family Diner, which is a group of workers who are fighting as part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to be in a union. Recently the workers won the rehiring of several dozen employees who were fired in an anti-union campaign conducted by management.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthanatosgonzales%2Fvideos%2F10154606622636155%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="317" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Some footage (video, above) from (January 16, 2018) &ldquo;Sip In&rdquo; at Stardust diner, where servers and former staff are fighting for the right to join a union (that&rsquo;s right, they&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">don&rsquo;t even have the right to fight for their rights), along with a laundry list of other abuses perpetuated by management.</span></p>
<p>The idea was to disrupt the Saturday dinner rush&mdash;several arrived, were seated, and only ordered water (with copious amounts of lemon), stayed for an hour or so, tipped the server generously (so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be punished financially), and then as we left, told the manager that they should allow the servers to join the union.</p>
<p>The very talented singing staff started the action by singing Twister Sister&rsquo;s &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Not Gonna Take It&rdquo; (feat. in the musical &ldquo;School of Rock&rdquo;), then went into Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Union Maid.&rdquo; During the chorus (&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t scare me, I&rsquo;m sticking to the union&hellip;&rdquo;), those participants in the diner, stood up, held their waters and ketchup bottles aloft and sang along (To the wtf-bewilderment of all the tourists). Then one of the servers who was fired last week for joining the union came in off the streets, grabbed a mic, and somehow turned &ldquo;New York, New York&rdquo; into an accusatory political anthem. She stood on the booth, pointed to the patrons, and after she belted the final note, raised her fist, and shouted &ldquo;Worker&rsquo;s Rights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Best dinner in quite a while&hellip;</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 10/09/2017 - 6:28pm</p>
<p><strong>By Stardust Family United - October 4, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Stardust1_0.jpg" width="320" height="208" align="right" alt="" />In a major victory for the singing servers at Ellen&rsquo;s Stardust Diner, their employer has reached an agreement with their solidarity union, Stardust Family United, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). By entering into the settlement agreement, the company will narrowly avoid a trial on some 19 violations of the National Labor Relations Act, including 31 retaliatory firings.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, all 31 employees termina<span class="text_exposed_show">ted over the last year in retaliation for union activity have been offered immediate and full reinstatement, and will receive back pay from the time they were fired. Of the terminated employees, 13 will immediately return to work at the popular Midtown diner.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>In addition, the restaurant is required to mail official notices to all employees, informing them that the company will not violate federal law by engaging in certain unlawful practices such as surveilling and threatening workers, interfering with their use of social media, and discouraging them from taking action to improve working conditions.</p>
<p>For the singing servers, this has been a long road. The union, which is a branch of the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), initially went public in late summer of 2016. Weeks after making their efforts known to management, 16 active union members were fired. Over the fall and winter, the workers continued to engage in direct workplace action to improve health and safety conditions, as well as pursue other demands. Another mass firing in January 2017 brought the total of terminated singers up to 31.</p>
<p>Despite this, Stardust Family United remained active, both inside and outside the restaurant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled and proud to know our struggle and vigilance over the last year has paid off,&rdquo; says returning employee Matthew Patterson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to returning and making a positive impact inside the diner.&rdquo;</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 08/10/2017 - 7:40pm</p>
<p><strong>By Marianne Garneau - <a href="http://blackrosefed.org/uaw-nissan-vote/" target="_blank">Black Rose Anarchist Federation</a>, August 7, 2017<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/nissan-workers.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="213" align="right" />There&rsquo;s been much attention over the reported <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/workers-mississippi-nissan-plant-casting-ballots-union-49027849" target="_blank">loss of a UAW union election</a> at a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi on Friday, August 4th. Many see the organizing effort as part of a larger question of whether the US labor movement can organize in the historically unorganized and union-hostile South. <a href="https://wobblycity.org/" target="_blank">New York City IWW</a> organizer Marianne Garneau writes this brief commentary offering her assessment. <br />
</em></p>
<p>The defeat of a UAW election bid at a Nissan plant in Mississippi got a tremendous amount of attention this week, particularly from the left. People seemed especially disheartened by the defeat, and almost at a loss for why things turned out so badly for the union. Sure enough, the internet produced all kinds of hot, world-historic takes explaining the outcome, a lot of them looking for some kind of exceptional circumstances here. Most zeroed in on the Southern context.</p>
<p>Granted, the union defeat was unfortunate. And it is possible it could have gone another way &ndash; we shouldn&rsquo;t think it was some inevitable outcome (there is way too much fatalism on the left these days). But the reasons why the UAW failed are perfectly legible, and none of them are novel. Everything about the loss &ndash; the union&rsquo;s strategy, the company&rsquo;s union-busting, the social and political context &ndash; was textbook.</p>
<h2>Why the UAW Vote at Nissan Failed</h2>
<p>1. The company union-busted like crazy. And yes, union-busting includes things like playing on racial divisions and threatening people&rsquo;s jobs (these are the sticks), and paying workers high salaries (the carrots). The bosses apparently built a tent outside the plant and met with every single worker on shift, including the ones who weren&rsquo;t even eligible to vote in the election. That&rsquo;s brilliant union-busting, but it&rsquo;s to be expected. That&rsquo;s why unions have a counterstrategy to that, called &ldquo;inoculation,&rdquo; where workers are prepared ahead of time for the boss&rsquo; rhetoric, and their sticks and carrots.</p>
<p>2. The union took a weak-ass, conservative, timid stance of mostly trying to keep the stuff the company was already giving workers and playing nice/reasonable with management. UAW has repeatedly said that it wants to work with companies to help their bottom line healthy, etc. That borrows directly from the boss&rsquo;s logic that they are gifting workers a job and a wage, as opposed to workers generating all the profits the owners get to pocket.</p>
<p>3. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) played its usual role of &ldquo;wot, us?&rdquo; It slowly churned through its processes of listening to complaints from either side. I don&rsquo;t even remember what the outcome was of its rulings (or if it ever got to them). But that&rsquo;s how little that matters to the actual, bloody fight &ldquo;on the shop floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. By the way, none of this has anything to do with &ldquo;the south.&rdquo; What is supposed to be unique here? The fact that other jobs in the area pay terribly? The fact that workers are divided along racial lines? The fact that union density is low? Those are exactly the same conditions that beleaguer workers, and organizing efforts, elsewhere.</p>
<p>5. And yeah, unfortunately, these workers, who presumably voted this way out of fear, and wanting to keep their jobs, will die on their knees as their wages get cut, their jobs get automated or outsourced, or they get replaced by lower-wage temps. You can&rsquo;t &ldquo;play nice&rdquo; or compromise your way to better wages or conditions. Playing nice with the boss means they retain the power to control your wages and your working conditions. The only alternative is to amass real power on the shop floor &ndash; real power to disrupt the flow of profits &ndash; and control how the boss treats you. You can&rsquo;t escape the forces of capitalism inside of one plant, but you can fight like hell over every single site where your labor is exploited for the boss&rsquo;s gain.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t avoid the class war; workers need to make it clear to the bosses that they can&rsquo;t either.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 03/13/2017 - 5:07pm</p>
<p><strong>By Chilli Sauce - <a target="_blank" href="../../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWStardust.jpg"><em>Libcom.Org</em></a>, March 5, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWStardust.jpg" align="right" height="196" width="320" alt="" />Ellen's Stardust Diner is a New York institution, a place where Broadway actors not only wait tables, but sing show tunes while they're at it. It's also the site of an ongoing labor dispute that has seen mass firings, strikes, protests, and picket lines that have turned away early morning food deliveries.</p>
<p>The employees at Ellen's have been organizing with the IWW for much of the past year. Their union, Stardust Family United, has been out on the streets, raising their voices and raising their fists to defend and improve working conditions.</p>
<p>Many Stardusters have worked at the restaurant on and off for years. To hear them tell it, Ellen's used to be a pretty nice place to work. Management were accommodating when it came to taking time off to be in a show. And despite the large numbers of wait staff and the time they take off for stage work, Ellen's was a tight-knit community. It was a place where workers developed their talents and built friendships that spanned decades.</p>
<p>All that changed last year when new management was brought in.</p>
<p>Managers ceased to be accommodating when it came to taking time off. Workers who raised safety issues or complained of sexual harassment were ignored or, worse yet, pushed out of the restaurant. Long-term workers, some whom had racked up years of service in the double digits, were unceremoniously let go.</p>
<p>So the idea came about to form a union. Workers contacted a couple of local unions and the IWW proved the most responsive, quickly arranging an organizer training for the Stardust staff. The workers found the IWW's model of solidarity unionism, which stresses rank-and-file control and a direct action approach to organizing, to be an asset to the solidarity they'd already built up in the workplace.</p>
<p>For a while, organizing occurred under the radar. Issues of health and safety were raised and workers used the internal communication system to pressure management. Workers also organized a successful march on the boss to get their tip bucket back and it was after this point the workers decided to go public as a union. The venue through which they chose to do this: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/nyregion/a-manhattan-diners-new-management-has-servers-singing-a-defiant-tune.html?_r=0" class="bb-url">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Workers hadn't filed for a labor board election, instead demanding owner Ken Sturm deal with them directly.</p>
