<p><img width="281" height="208" border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU460/NYCmisc/83193.jpg" />Five workers from Top City Produce were recently fired from their jobs. The &ldquo;Gang of Five&rdquo; &ndash; Osvaldo, Mario, Diego, Esau, and Carlos &ndash; have been some of the strongest and most active members of the IWW since they joined the union almost two years ago.<br /> <br /> After one of the workers was suspended on Saturday, the other four approached the boss in an attempt to discuss the situation. On Monday morning, the boss told them all to wait outsede and then never allowed them back in. They continue to be locked out.<br /> <br /> Before joining the union, Top City workers consistently pulled 72-hour weeks with no overtime and no benefits. Conditions improved once the shop went union. Workers filed a lawsuit against Top City for wage violations and negotiated a contract with the boss. They were waiting for the boss to sign the contract when they were fired without warning on Monday.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/18/2007 - 9:21am</p>
<p>by Amy Zimmer / <A target="_blank" HREF="http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/Posh_protest/10042.html">
Metro New York</a><IMG SRC="http://www.metro.us/metroimages/11139.jpg" align="right" border="1" /></p><p>MEATPACKING DISTRICT. The workers who filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against Wild Edibles, a high-end seafood retail and wholesale company, didn’t hold their press conference at the company’s Long Island City warehouse or one of its three retail locations. Instead, they stood in front of Pastis — Keith McNally’s fashionable French restaurant.
<BR /><BR />
Pastis, the workers say, is one of Wild Edibles’ big customers. They allege Wild Edibles systematically denied overtime pay and, when workers tried to assert their rights, they faced retaliation.
<BR /><BR />
Pedro Hernandez, who cleans and weighs fish and oversees oysters, has worked at the warehouse for nearly a year and earns $450 a week for the 56 hours he puts in.
<BR /><BR />
“They make us work a lot, at least three hours above the eight-hour day,” Henandez said through a translator. “We were told we would get a raise after three months, but that never happened.”
<BR /><BR />
Brandworkers International, a new nonprofit workers’ rights group, along with Industrial Workers of the World IU460-640, organized yesterday’s rally to raise awareness for their campaign to improve conditions for the low-wage jobs held mainly by immigrant workers at warehouses in Brooklyn and Queens.
<BR /><BR />
Workers at 10 city food warehouses have joined the IWW. Four from Wild Edibles who tried to unionize with IU460-640 were fired, workers alleged.
<BR /><BR />
Representatives from Wild Edibles and Pastis declined comment.
<BR /><BR />
Daniel Gross, co-founder of Brandworkers, hoped passers-by got the message.
<BR /><BR />
“Focus on the food chain,” he said. “Consider what’s on your plate. One step before that tuna hits it, workers at Wild Edibles and elsewhere are working in shameful and deplorable conditions.”</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
