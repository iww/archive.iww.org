<p>Embattled Kosher Food Factory Faces Growing Retail Consensus on Workers' Rights Abuses<br />
<br />
New York, NY- Morton Williams, a well-known chain of twelve supermarkets, has discontinued the sale of Sonny &amp; Joe's hummus over concerns about workers' rights violations at Flaum Appetizing Corp., the Brooklyn-based producer and owner of the Sonny &amp; Joe's brand.&nbsp; Morton Williams joins a critical mass of prominent retailers including Fairway, Zabar's, and Food Emporium that have dropped Sonny &amp; Joe's hummus after immigrant workers began speaking out against pervasive wage theft, abusive management, and denial of benefits at Flaum.&nbsp; Workers are waging an energetic campaign with the Focus on the Food Chain initiative to bring Flaum Appetizing and its owner Moishe Grunhut into compliance with the rule of law and to recover illegally withheld compensation.&nbsp; 45 supermarket and grocery store locations have pulled Sonny &amp; Joe's hummus off the shelves amid the heated dispute over Flaum's lack of respect for immigrant workers.<br />

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/22/2011 - 1:56pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/signing%20settlement.preview.jpg" align="right" /><b>By NYC Wobblies</b></p>
<p>Brooklyn, NY - After an aggressive nine month campaign consisting of both legal action and increasingly more militant direct action, the New York City branch of the Industrial Workers of the World was victorious in seeking justice for fellow worker Jeff Bauer, who was fired from the 7th Ave location of Ozzie’s Coffee & Tea on June 29, 2010.</p>
<p>Jeff Bauer worked at the independent Park Slope coffee shop, a neighborhood institution, for over a year and proved himself to be a hard worker with a strong work ethic. The quality of his labor was never questioned before his union affiliation with the IWW was leaked to management when Bauer helped organize a May Day benefit for the NYC branch of the IWW in 2010. In fact, Bauer was offered the Store Manager position, before it was given to Raphael Bernadine, but turned it down on principle as it went against his political beliefs as both an anarchist and a Wobbly. When management was made aware Bauer was organizing with the One Big Union their response was harsh and relentless. Bauer was subjected to mistreatment, harassment, and verbal abuse on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In June of 2010 Bauer suffered a severe cut in hours when he stood up for a coworker who was physically assaulted and threatened by Store Manager Raphael Bernadine’s boyfriend, an ex-cop, on the shop floor. In response to this retaliatory attack on Bauer’s right to defend his coworker from a violent confrontation, as well as his legally protected right to discuss workplace conditions, Bauer led a union delegation of six Wobblies and supporters into Ozzie’s Coffee & Tea. The purpose of this “March on the Boss” was to deliver a demand letter directly to Bernadine and officially notify him of Bauer’s affiliation with the IWW. Bauer’s list of demands included his hours be restored to 40, his only written warning be retracted and removed from his permanent record, an immediate cease to any and all harassment and/or retaliation based upon his union affiliation and for Ozzie’s to obey all federal labor laws, including those that relate to paid overtime.</p>
<p>When Ozzie’s co-owner Melissa Azulai found out about the demand letter, and the fraudulent and unnecessary 911 call, Jeff Bauer was immediately removed from the schedule and unlawfully terminated a week later. Azulai didn’t have the decency to fire Bauer to his face; instead she informed his then legal counsel, friend and comrade Daniel Gross, via a phone call. During this same phone conversation Azulai told FW Gross that “this will all blow over, it always does.” Gross informed Azulai that that’s not how the IWW operates, that when we start a campaign we stick with it until the bitter end. When Azulai refused to reinstate Bauer, Gross helped Bauer file Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). At the same time the NYC branch of the IWW launched an aggressive campaign of direct action that ranged from union-wide phone and email zaps to increasingly more spirited pickets and demonstrations in front of the store.</p>
<p>Six months later, on December 23, 2010, Region 29 of the NLRB found merit with Bauer’s claims and issued a complaint against Ozzie’s Coffee & Tea. A February 8, 2011 hearing date was set to take place in front of an administrative law judge. This was later postponed due to the beginning of heated settlement talks between Azulai’s lawyer, Eric M. Baum, Esq. from Simon, Eisenberg & Baum, and Bauer’s legal representation Benjamin N. Dictor and Quisquella Addison, legal interns from the Labor and Employment Law Clinic of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, under co-directors Dan Silverman & Michael Silverman.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://parkslope.patch.com/articles/former-ozzies-barista-settles-for-15500">By Kristin V Brown - <i>Park Slope Patch</i>, April 3, 2011</a> - Reposted in accordance with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">Fair Use Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Last month a former Ozzie's employee settled a suit alleging that the local shop discriminated against his union involvement.</p>
<p>A former Ozzie&rsquo;s barista settled for $15,500 last month after the National Labor Relations Board filed suit against the local java joint, claiming it discriminated against the barista for his union affiliations.</p>
<p>Jeff Baurer, 41, claimed that the coffee shop unfairly terminated him for his affiliation with Industrial Workers of the World (also known as the Wobblies), an international union that believes all workers should be united and the wage system must be abolished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can move on with my life knowing that at least one boss will think twice before interfering with a worker's right to organize for dignity and respect in the workplace,&rdquo; said Bauer.</p>
<p>Bauer claimed that before his termination last June from the Seventh Avenue and Lincoln Place shop, he was constantly praised by management as a model employee and even offered the manager position. Then his employers&rsquo; sentiments quickly changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ozzie's violated my legally protected right to join and/or form a union in the workplace,&rdquo; said Bauer, who worked at the spot for nearly a year. &ldquo;They harassed me, retaliated against me, reduced my hours, demoted me and terminated me for engaging in protected concerted activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former barista believes that someone leaked his affiliation to management when he was organizing a May Day benefit for the IWW.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/3/31/starbucks-union-locke-students/">By Mercer R. Cook - <i>The Harvard Crimson</i>, March 31, 2011</a> - reprinted according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">Fair Use</a> guidelines.</p>
<p>Harvard students, union members, and Starbucks employees from around the country are planning to protest a lecture by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz at Harvard Business School on Friday.</p>
<p>Schultz will be speaking to several hundred Business School students on his experiences running a successful business while also be promoting his new book, &ldquo;Onward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Libert&eacute; Locke, an organizer of the event, said Starbucks employees are angered by what they deem to be hypocrisy in Schultz&rsquo;s book, in which he expresses his commitment to his &ldquo;partners&rdquo;&mdash;as the company calls its workers. Employees of the company, especially union members, feel that Starbucks is one of the least labor friendly companies in America, Locke said. Starbucks has been found guilty by the National Labor Relations Board of violating labor rights, including charges of union busting and wrongful termination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Howie [Schultz] to sit around and claim how much he loves us, it&rsquo;s just disgusting,&rdquo; said Locke, a Starbucks barista and Starbucks Workers Union organizer from New York. &ldquo;Starbucks is one of the biggest union busting corporations in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvard union representatives said they planned to support Starbucks workers in the protest.</p>
<p>Geoffrey &ldquo;Geoff&rdquo; Carens, an assistant librarian and member of the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers, emphasized what he called the &ldquo;phoniness&rdquo; of Schultz&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howard Schultz likes to present Starbucks as a socially responsible corporation,&rdquo; Carens said. &ldquo;In reality, conditions are really bad and getting worse.&rdquo;</p>

Dear Friends,<br />
<br />
Almost two years ago MPG(Media Planning Group), a global ad agency, began a massive layoff operation with the arrival of a new CEO, Shaun Holliday. Included in the severance contract were two anti-employee provisions. The first took away the employee's right to sue if MPG were to violate any portion of the agreement while the company reserved its right to sue if the employee were to violate the agreement. The second provision restricts the employee from saying anything bad about MPG and at the same time the company can badmouth the employee with impunity. When one of their former employees, Joseph Sanchez, refused to sign the lopsided agreement MPG refused to negotiate a fair severance agreement. To this date the major ad agency hasn't paid a cent to Joseph even though the parent company, Havas, continues to increase its profits.<br />
<br />
In less than a year MPG sacked CEO Shaun Holliday. Please take a moment and let MPG know that they haven't finished correcting their mistakes until they make a fair and equitable severance agreement with their employees. <a href="http://www.citizenspeak.org/node/2128" target="_blank">Click here</a> to send an e-mail to the CEO and EVP of HR of MPG.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued support ensuring that working people are respected.<br />
<br />
Solidarity,<br />
