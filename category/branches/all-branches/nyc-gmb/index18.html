The dramatic battles of the American labor movement were often fought
in hazardous settings like the coal fields of Kentucky or the textile
mills of Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
In recent times, though, a different type of labor dispute has
become familiar in New York, focused on the retail outlets that keep
upscale customers fed and caffeinated.
</p>
<p>
And so it was that a crowd of about 50 people wrapped in scarves and
bandannas against the cold gathered Monday morning outside a Starbucks
at the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 33rd Street.
</p>
<p>
As their breath steamed the air, they chanted and sang. They carried
long banners bearing the logo of the Industrial Workers of the World, a
union founded in 1905 that has been trying to organize Starbucks
workers since 2004.

passes for history these days, what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. was doing when he was assassinated is left out. In
the current atmosphere of unbridled hostility to labor organizing,
it's worthwhile to recall those final days of his life.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Dr. King traveled to Memphis
in support of a watershed strike of mostly black city sanitation
workers. The workers initiated their historic work stoppage
to vindicate the basic right of free association in the form
of a labor union. The government deemed their efforts illegal
and worked aggressively to defeat them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">While wages and working conditions
including health and safety were critical issues, there's no
doubt that the strike was also about human dignity itself. Indeed,
many of the workers and their community supporters carried picket
signs reading simply, &quot;I AM A MAN.&quot; </span>

</p>
<p>
An NLRB judge recently ruled in favor of the IWW in the case of
13 workers who were terminated from EZ Supply last winter. The workers
were ordered to be reinstated and paid backwages. The amount of
backwages is to be determined at a compliance hearing that will take
place in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Throughout 2006, the IWW had multiple bargaining sessions with
EZ Supply Corp. In December of that year, the company changed its name
to Sunrise Plus and fired the IWW members from the shop. The judge’s
decision concluded that Sunrise Plus was an alter ego EZ Supply and
that the workers were fired due to union activity.

</p>
<p>
A Manhattan federal judge has ordered a New York City
seafood purveyor not to retaliate against workers who
are suing the company for allegedly violating state
and federal labor laws.
</p>
<p>
Southern District Judge Louis L. Stanton has issued a
preliminary injunction against Wild Edibles, a
wholesale and retail chain that has been featured on
&quot;The Martha Stewart Show&quot; and on the Food Network. The
judge prohibited the company from taking any &quot;adverse
employment action against, or terminating the
employment of&quot; any worker who decides to be part of
the suit.
