</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/25/2006 - 3:58am</p>
<img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/01_picket_line.jpg" />November 22, 2006<br /><br />Five unjustly fired IWW baristas entered the Starbucks regional headquarters today to demand their jobs back and demand that Starbucks cease its scorched earth union-busting policy. As SWU members and community supporters picketed outside, the fired baristas delegation addressed their demands to Starbucks &quot;Partner and Asset Protection Investigator&quot; Marc Stella inside the company's posh office across from the Empire State Building. Marc Stella is the company's internal Pinkerton who conducted the sham investigation against Daniel Gross and is likely complicit in all the baristas' terminations. Regional Director Jim McDermott was conveniently out of the office enjoying the Thanksgiving Weekend and his fat cat salary as baristas work extra-hard meeting holiday demand on a poverty wage. <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
