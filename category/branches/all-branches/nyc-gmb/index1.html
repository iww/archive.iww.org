</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 11/09/2016 - 10:44pm</p>
<p><strong>By Eric D - New York City IWW, November 9, 2016</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/LeftOfLeft.jpg" alt="" width="320" align="right" height="478" />On a recent evening, members and friends of the New York City General Membership Branch gathered to hear a book discussion by Anatole Dolgoff. The talk was held at MayDay, a left movement space in Brooklyn. Dolgoff, a professor at the nearby Pratt Institute, was discussing his new book about his father Sam, <a href="https://www.akpress.org/left-of-the-left.html"><i>Left of the Left, My Memories of Sam Dolgoff </i></a>, recently published by AK Press. The talk was introduced by radical scholars Yesenia Barragan and Mark Bray.</p>
<p>Sam was born in 1902 in Belarus and came to New York City at an early age. With little formal education, Sam went to work as a painter, and quickly found himself immersed in local radical politics. A brief membership with the Socialist Party led him to realize that he was an anarchist. He soon joined the IWW in the 1920&rsquo;s and was a member until his death in 1990. Along the way, he developed friendships with many notable radicals, and had particularly close relationships with Carlo Tresca, the Italian anarchist, and Ben Fletcher, the legendary waterfront organizer.</p>
<p>Sam was a Wobbly activist and organizer for decades, involved in many campaigns and projects, speaking on street corners, meeting with workers who were organizing, confronting fascists in the 1930&rsquo;s, and doing the dangerous and unglamorous work of keeping radical ideas alive during the tough times of the McCarthy era. Self-educated in the movement along the way, Dolgoff made significant contributions to the anarchist literature over the years, including a book on Bakunin.</p>
<p>According to Anatole, Sam knew everyone in Left circles for decades. One memorable anecdote about his father told the story of when they went to see the movie <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Reds</i> together. Sam couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet during the film, as he maintained a running commentary on nearly every major character, who he had known personally.</p>
<p>The book is a fantastic tour through the life and times of a lifelong Wobbly and working class intellectual, as well as a touching personal memoir of growing up in a radical family. It&rsquo;s a great contribution to left history and we encourage all Wobblies to read it.</p>

<p><strong>By Lawrence Goun and Biko Koenig</strong></p>
<p>Workers at Tom Cat Bakery sharpened their resistance against company attacks this summer with a solidarity BBQ in front of the Queens-based factory. Tom Cat's private equity owners, Ancor and Merit Capital, are seeking devastating health care cuts and other takeaways from workers in contract negotiations with the Bakery Union. Dual-card IWW members are leading a struggle to build long-term power and secure a good contract, after beating back a de-certification attempt from a mob-dominated union earlier this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These out-of-town investors already have their mansions, while we barely can support our families. The cuts they're demanding are impossible and we're united against them,&rdquo; said Marino Aquino, a night-shift packer at Tom Cat and a member of the IWW. &ldquo;Our unity is our strength and we will keep the pressure on until justice prevails.&rdquo;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

<p>A federal judge has awarded a group of immigrant workers over $950,000 in unpaid wages for work at a Queens-based beverage distributor. A group of Latino warehouse workers and truck drivers brought the class action lawsuit against Beverage Plus and its owners after years of disrespect and systematic violations of state and federal law, violations which the judge found were intentional. The workers are members of Focus on the Food Chain, a coalition promoting good jobs and a sustainable food system in New York City's growing food processing and distribution sector.</p>
<p>&quot;My co-workers and I were deprived of our pay and badly exploited but we finally learned about our rights,&quot; said Richard Merino, who drove a delivery truck at Beverage Plus for six years and was a named plaintiff in the case. &quot;We stood up together and now justice has arrived for us and more importantly for our families.&quot;</p>
<p>Beverage Plus employees were worked as many as twelve hours a day, deprived of overtime, and subjected to unlawful deductions from their pay.</p>

<p><b>By Daniel Gross - May 7, 2012</b></p>
<p>We are overjoyed to announce the biggest victory yet from Focus on the Food Chain!&nbsp; Workers at Flaum Appetizing, with your unwavering support, have won their campaign with an exemplary global agreement.&nbsp; Our members have recovered $577,000 in unpaid wages and compensation for retaliation along with a binding code of conduct ensuring Flaum comports with all workplace rights going forward including anti-discrimination and health &amp; safety protections.<br />
<br />

<br />
For over a decade, workers at Flaum Appetizing worked grueling sixty to eighty hour work weeks without overtime pay and sometimes not even the minimum wage.&nbsp; Latino workers were subjected to constant verbal harassment and forced to work at unsafe speeds.&nbsp; Focus on the Food Chain, a joint project of Brandworkers and the NYC IWW, helped the workers launch a powerful campaign that persuaded over 120 grocery store locations to remove Flaum products from their shelves and convinced the world's largest kosher cheese company to stop using Flaum as a distributor until workers' rights were respected. In the process, Flaum workers won a precedent-setting victory at the Labor Board in D.C. helping workers nationwide fend off unfounded allegations into their immigration status.<br />

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 04/28/2012 - 12:44pm</p>
<p><b>By liberte Locke - April 11, 2012</b></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/alexsleeping-300x239.jpg" alt="" />I drag my broken jittery body home through the maze of late night construction New York City subways. I finally reach my quiet apartment where the only ones up are our three cats screaming for food and persistently walking just where I&rsquo;m trying to walk. Tonight I manage to not step on them but usually, in this state, I can&rsquo;t help it. I apologize with head-pettings and catnip. I feed the cats and then remember that I spent my entire lunch break at work chain smoking away that last extremely rude customer I had before clocking for my break instead of eating the ramen noodles that I brought. I open the fridge and realize that every meal possible would take way more work than I have in me so I close the door.</p>
<p>I go to the bathroom and while peeing set my alarm on my phone. This is a ritual. I&rsquo;ve learned in the past that it is completely possible after a closing shift that I may just fall asleep in the bathroom. And if not the bathroom, maybe while sitting up trying to eat a late meal or laying on the couch watching tv. So setting my alarm as soon as I get home is crucial. Being late to work when I&rsquo;m targeted by management (because of being a union organizer) is not an option, ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m awake enough from all the caffeine I consumed at my job, Starbucks, that I don&rsquo;t fall asleep in the bathroom but I do spend ten minutes fumbling brainlessly through the clean laundry I didn&rsquo;t have time to put up. I&rsquo;m looking for something loose to sleep in &ndash; it takes so long because twice I forget entirely why I&rsquo;m digging through the bag and I start putting laundry up thinking that is what I what I meant to be doing. I then suddenly stop, thinking to myself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late for this, I&rsquo;m exhausted. Go to bed. Go to bed.&rdquo; I finally change and go into the living room to watch tv.</p>
<p>I already know that going straight to bed, no matter how tired I am, won&rsquo;t work. I have to turn off my brain first. Without some distraction my brain will just fill will endless To-Do lists. My responsibilities pile up. All the things I need to get done combine with what I&rsquo;d like to get done. I&rsquo;m filled with regret for what I was unable to get done with my day because of having work and then being too exhausted to do anything else. I&rsquo;m so tired that petty concerns really consume me. I think and re-think about Facebook status updates to reflect my exhaustion and busyness just praying that all the crucial folks will see it and realize why I haven&rsquo;t returned their phone calls, emails, or finished my deadlines for different projects. These lists go on and on but I&rsquo;m too tired to even hold a pen to write the lists down.</p>
