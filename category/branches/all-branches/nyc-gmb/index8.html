<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 09/30/2010 - 12:56pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg" align="right" />Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) union barista Jeffrey W. Bauer was wrongfully fired for organizing at Ozzie's Coffee & Tea in New York City on June 29th, 2010.</p>
<p>The NYC IWW has been engaged in a fight for justice for Fellow Worker Jeff Bauer, both through Direct Action and filing Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).</p>
<p><b>PHONE ZAP General Store Manager, Rafael at both Ozzie's locations!!!!</b></p>
<p>Thursday, September 30th. Noon to 5 pm EST call (718) 768-6868 ask for Rafael or available manager.</p>
<p>Friday, October 1st. 10 am to 3 pm EST call (718) 398-6695 Ask for Rafael, Melissa or available manager.</p>
<p>Demand that...</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Union barista Jeff Bauer be immediately reinstated.</li>
<li>2. Ozzie's treat their employees with respect and obey Federal Labor Laws.</li>
<li>3. Stop lying about Jeff Bauer's work ethic to the NLRB and the media.</li>
</ul>
<p>IWW union barista Jeff Bauer worked at Ozzie's for over a year and proved himself to be a hard worker with a strong work ethic. The quality of his labor was never questioned before his union affiliation was leaked to management. In fact, Jeff was offered the General Store Manager position before it was given to Rafael, but turned it down on principal as it went against his political beliefs as both an anarchist and a unionist.</p>

<p><i>At Stake Are Their Jobs and $230,000 in Back Pay From Flaum Appetizing, a Kosher Food Producer in Brooklyn</i></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU460/NYCmisc/flaum-080510.jpg" align="right" /><b><a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/129832/" target="_blank">By Maia Efrem - <i>The Jewish Daily Forward</i>, August 4, 2010</a></b></p>
<p>Workers who were fired by a Brooklyn kosher food producer after demanding overtime pay have been protesting outside the owner’s house and a supermarket this summer, and preparing for a return to the National Labor Relations Board this fall.</p>
<p>Flaum Appetizing, Inc., a producer of kosher salads, pickles, and smoked fish, has been embroiled in the dispute since it fired17 immigrant workers in May 2008. The terminated workers had complained about working conditions and demanded to be paid overtime after working 60 to 80 hours a week. The NLRB ruled that Flaum had violated the workers’ rights, and ordered their reinstatement with back pay. Flaum has not complied, and a NLRB hearing is set for September 21.</p>
<p>“Our belief is that if you work, if you sweat and deliver a service, you’re entitled to have your legal rights protected, and that includes payment for your work,” said Daniel Gross, executive director of Brandworkers International, a not-for-profit organization that advocates workers’ rights and has taken up the cause along with the Industrial Workers of the World union.</p>
<p>“The [fired] workers are currently very active on the streets, and we seek dialogue, but we are also not afraid to fight,” Gross said.</p>

Howard Schultz Still Silent Amid Growing Evidence of a Hostile Work Environment<br />
<br />
New York, NY- In a risky departure from the normal chain of command, a group of  Starbucks district managers have authored an impassioned letter to top executives in Seattle demanding that action be taken against a company vice president allegedly engaged in pervasive sexual harassment.  <br />
<br />
The letter, which was made available to the IWW Starbucks Workers Union, alleges that Regional Vice President Andrew Alfano has created an unsafe work environment with his behavior and is responsible for the departure of two female regional directors, among many other troubling charges.  <br />

Workers Rights' Group Files Class Action Lawsuit Against Beverage Distributor Over Alleged Labor Violations<br />
<br />
Immigrant Workers Take a Stand for Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay<br />
<br />
New York, NY-  A non-profit workers' rights organization filed a class action lawsuit on Friday alleging that a Queens-based drink distributor,<br />
Beverage-Plus, is violating the rights of its immigrant workforce.<br />
The lawsuit was filed in New York federal court on behalf of current and former delivery drivers and warehouse assistants who were allegedly denied minimum wage and overtime by Beverage-Plus, in addition to other rights violations.  The case is an effort of the Brandworkers Focus on the Food Chain initiative which is exposing abuses in NYC's food processing sector and was brought in association with law firm Vladeck, Waldman, Elias &amp; Engelhard, P.C.<br />
<br />
&quot;My co-workers and I work hard and now we are demanding to be paid according to the law,&quot; said Richard Merino, a member of Brandworkers who has been a driver at Beverage-Plus for six years.  &quot;Wage theft is very damaging and we have chosen to tackle the problem by organizing together and taking collective action.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawyers for the workers will seek class certification to recover allegedly withheld compensation for current and former Beverage-Plus workers who have worked at the company in the last six years.  Maia Goodell and Anand Swaminathan of Vladeck Waldman are serving as lead counsel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tens of thousands of recent immigrant workers labor out-of-sight in exploitative conditions processing and distributing food to New York's markets and restaurants,&quot; said Daniel Gross, the director of Brandworkers.  &quot;Wage theft, abusive treatment, non-existent benefits, and hostility to organizing are endemic in the sector but workers' resolve to assert their rights is strong and growing.  Brandworkers Focus on the Food Chain will press on until New York's food processing employees win respect for their human rights and just recognition for their important contribution to our economy and our community.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandworkers is a New York-based non-profit organization protecting and advancing the rights of retail and food employees.  By providing workers with legal, advocacy, and organizing tools, Brandworkers ensures employer compliance with the law and challenges corporate misconduct in the community.  The Brandworkers Focus on the Food Chain initiative promotes a sustainable food system where workers' human rights are respected. <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
