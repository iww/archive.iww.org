</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 04/30/2007 - 12:35pm</p>
<em>Since 2004, the managers at Starbucks stores across America have been trembling in the workplace, for the infamous revolutionary union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies) has been organising with workers and fighting for a better wage and a better world. When I set out to conduct an interview with some of the rank and file union members, I soon discovered that getting a hold of these people can be very difficult (apparently they&rsquo;re all very busy fighting the class war). Eventually, Daniel Gross, perhaps the most well-known member of the Starbucks Workers Union, was kind enough to grant me an interview.<br /><br />In this wide-ranging interview with IWW organizer Daniel Gross conducted by the UK-based Now or Never!, Gross discusses the innovative worker-controlled organizing model, known as solidarity unionism, that has made gains for Starbucks workers where the bureaucratic union model has failed. Gross explains the role of anarchists and anti-authoritarians in the global Starbucks Workers Union effort as well as his own anarchist worldview. He highlights the resurgence of the IWW, the challenge of precarious work, and calls for a direct action movement across borders to challenge the hegemony of corporate power. Gross also pays tribute to fallen comrade Brad Will who was a supporter of the Starbucks Workers Union and radical labor.</em> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

<p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/pgh_pickets2.jpg" />With the decertification of the last seven unionized Starbucks outlets in Vancouver... there is now only one unionized Starbucks in the World. It's in Regina and the employees there are represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.<br /><br />You'd think that might take the steam out of - other drives to unionize Starbucks outlets. But not so - for Daniel Gross. He's not backing away from his own bid - although he is taking a slightly different tact. Three years ago while he was working as a &quot;barista&quot; at a Starbucks in New York City, he organized the Starbucks Workers' Union and affiliated the group with the International Workers of the World.<br /><br />Daniel Gross was fired last July in disputed circumstances. And late last month, the U.S. National Labor Relations Board charged Starbucks with 30 violations of the law in an alleged attempt to ward off union activity at four Manhattan outlets. Starbucks denies the charges.<br /><br />Daniel Gross is still an organizer with the Starbucks Workers' Union and he was in New York City.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
