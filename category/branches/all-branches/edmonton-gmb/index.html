</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/20/2011 - 3:12pm</p>
<p><a href="https://recompositionblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/waves-of-struggle-the-winter-campaign-at-the-post-office-in-edmonton/?mid=5530" target="_blank"><strong>By Phinneas Gage - originally posted at recompositionblog.wordpress.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Christine braced herself, took a deep breath and then jumped up on to a mail tub and began to shout &ldquo;help! help! I am being robbed.&rdquo; A sea of faces stared at her blankly. She got the attention her fellow Letter Carriers, but everyone was looking at her like she was crazy. That was fine, she was acting crazy. &ldquo;Canada Post is robbing every single one of us, they are robbing people collecting pensions, they are robbing workers who aren&rsquo;t even working here yet. We need to stand together, Winnipeg walked out and we need to show them that we have their back and will stand with them&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Some began to nod knowingly; she then explained that workers earlier in the week had walked out in an unlawful strike in Winnipeg over technological change that was causing twelve hour days and massive job loss. She explained that Winnipeg was a testing ground for the new work methods and that the workers in Winnipeg were not just fighting for themselves they were fighting for everyone at Canada Post Corporation. Christine explained the struggle, the stakes, and that our fellow workers in Winnipeg were counting on a show of solidarity from across the country. She may have been a bit dramatic, but she was also being honest, sometimes you have to shout to be heard.</p>
<p class="rteleft">The meeting Christine called was part of a wave of work floor meetings across the city. The wave started at another workplace, Depot Nine. At some of these meetings stewards read statements published by &ldquo;The Workers Struggle with the Modern Post&rdquo; a <a href="https://www.theworkerstrugglewiththemodernpost.blogspot.com/">grassroots Postal Workers blog</a> based out of Winnipeg. Some of the meetings were open assemblies open to all employees, where workers could plan their next steps and air grievances. These meetings were part of a very flexible plan, part strategy and part flying by the seat of our pants. The workers led the struggle and often the official union structures were left behind in the dust as workers on the floor took initiative. This wasn&rsquo;t centrally planned but it didn&rsquo;t just happen spontaneously. It wasn&rsquo;t outside and against the union nor was it a struggle within it against some abstract bureaucracy- we were trying something new on our own terms.</p>

<p><img hspace="8" border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/agitators/modern/Flint/anticapitalism.jpg" /><strong>By Eugene Plawiuk</strong> <strong>- <em>Industrial Worker</em>, September 2005.</strong> <br /> </p><p>It is time for the labour movement in Canada to grow a backbone and &quot;Just Say No!&quot; to working with or obeying Labour Relations Boards and their rulings. </p><p> In Alberta, recent rulings against unions include one that it's legal for Finning to outsource its work to the rat union CLAC plant. The fact that Jim Dinning, who hopes to replace Ralph as Premier of Alberta, sits on the Finning board probably influenced this decision against the Machinists whose members are having their jobs contracted out.</p> <p> A disputes inquiry is being held into the Lakeside Packers strike, effectively ending the strike for 60 days, but with no guarantee of binding arbitration. The union requested binding arbitration and the Minister of Labour never responded. Lakeside Packers is owned by the world's biggest meat merchant, Tyson Foods. Tyson is happy. Their plant is operating. Supervisors are telling employees the union is powerless.</p> <p> There is no fair or level playing field for workers in Alberta labour relations. The game is rigged in favour of the bosses. While unions have representatives on the Labour Relations Board, so do the bosses. In this case the government picked a management lawyer representing the anti-union Construction Industry Merit Shops as chair.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_219 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Edmonton General Membership Branch.

Scheduled on Aug. 26, the rally will be held in front of the CLAC in the Bob Lamb Industry Education Centre office between 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. &rsquo;We just want to raise awareness that CLAC as a union does not really represent its rank and file workers,&rsquo; Roberts said. </p><p align="left">Early in July, an estimated 4,000 union workers staged a rally here against the CLAC and on the issue of bringing temporary foreign workers to Fort McMurray. This time the focus of the rally will be more general and not just about foreign workers, said Roberts. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_219 first active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Edmonton General Membership Branch.
