<p>Press Conference and Delegation: 1pm Sunday September 26, Calhoun Square Jimmy Johns, 3001 Hennepin Ave. S.</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS– When Shift Supervisor Margaret Brickely began her morning prep work at Jimmy John's last Monday, she noticed that all of the meat and produce she pulled out of the cooler was warm and beginning to rot. The coolers had broken, leaving the meat at room temperature overnight. Margaret refused to serve the meat. Now, Jimmy John's is threatening her job in retaliation.</p>
<p>“The vegetables were shriveled, the meat hot, and the bread dough semi-cooked. This is not something I was willing to serve” says Margaret. “I called my District Manager Jason Effertz to inform him that the meat was rotten, and he ordered me to slice it and serve it. When I refused, Effertz came in and sliced the meat himself, preparing to sell it to customers.”</p>
<p>With the support of the newly-organized Jimmy Johns Workers Union, Margaret and her coworkers called the City of Minneapolis Health Department. A City Health Inspector came to the store, condemned the meat as unfit for human consumption, and forced management to throw it all away.</p>
<p>Had Margaret not taken a stand for proper sanitation, hundreds of customers would have been served rotten meat.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695 active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="" class="active">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p><b>Sandwich Workers Union Keeps the Pressure on as Unprecedented Union Election Approaches</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU640/jjworkers2sm.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS– Jimmy John’s workers were doing more than preparing french bread, cold cuts, and sliced tomatoes for “Dollar Sub Day” this morning as union members and supporters hit the bricks outside stores, asking customers to put up tip jars and use them.</p>
<p>The act of civil disobedience is meant to draw attention to a company policy that forbids tip jars, despite the fact that it costs nothing.</p>
<p>Union members say the action supports their goal of shifting power back to the workers. “We think having customers act in solidarity by putting up tip jars will give workers a glimpse of a better workplace, and a few more dollars in their pockets on one of the most hectic days” says Max Specktor, a bike delivery driver at multiple Jimmy John’s stores.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695 active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="" class="active">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns1.jpg" align="right" width=250 height=187 />MINNEAPOLIS - Sandwich workers at nine Minneapolis Jimmy John's locations made history Monday as they filed for the first-ever National Labor Relations Board union election at the national fast food chain.</p>
<p>If a majority of workers vote in favor of unionization, franchise owner Mike Mulligan will be legally bound to negotiate with a bargaining team elected by his employees.</p>
<p>"Since we formed a union 11 days ago, Mike Mulligan has refused to even talk to us. We intend to keep the pressure on management to meet our demands. They may be able to stonewall us for now, but when we win this election, Jimmy Johns will have no choice but to negotiate," said Mike Wilkow, a Jimmy Johns Workers Union member.</p>
<p>Since workers at nine Minneapolis Jimmy John's locations announced the formation of a union and demanded negotiations with franchise management on Sept. 2, the chain has been bombarded with an escalating campaign of actions in 32 states intended to bring management to the bargaining table. The Jimmy Johns Workers Union's demands include sick days, a no-nonsense worker's compensation policy, fair scheduling, livable wages, an end to sexual harassment, and other measures of basic fairness at work.</p>
<p>Franchise owner Mike Mulligan and general manager Rob Mulligan have ignored the union's repeated requests for negotiations. Union members say managers have begun using typical union-busting tactics, such as distributing threatening letters, calling employees into irregular one-on-one meetings, and making concessions to individual workers on demands around wages and hours.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is the first fast food union in the nation, and is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695 active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="" class="active">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p><b><a href=" " target="_blank">By Christine Des Garennes - The <i>News-Gazette</i>, September 15, 2010</a></b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns3.jpg" align="right" />
Employees of a Jimmy John&#39;s franchise in Minnesota have organized a union and are seeking better pay, better working conditions and more benefits.</p>
<p>
Right now the campaign is focused on organizing employees in the Minneapolis metropolitan area. The Jimmy John&#39;s sandwich chain, which has over 1,000 stores across the country, is headquartered in Champaign.</p>
<p>
An &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of sandwich workers at the Minneapolis stores favored forming a bargaining unit, according to union member and Jimmy John&#39;s worker Mike Wilklow. On Monday the group filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board to start the formal election process; that election is expected to take place in the coming months, Wilklow said.</p>
<p>
Once a majority of employees vote in favor of forming the union, the Minneapolis franchise owner must start negotiating with the union&#39;s bargaining team, he said.</p>
<p>
Workers announced the formation of the union earlier this month and have picketed outside several Minnesota stores since Labor Day. The union is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World, which has been helping Starbucks workers organize in recent years.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695 active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="" class="active">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 09/16/2010 - 3:40am</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU330/IU330Logo2color.jpg" align="right" />The Construction Workers Organizing Committee of the Industrial Workers of the World wishes to express our deepest solidarity with the Jimmy Johns Workers union. As union construction workers, we understand that the only way to maintain and raise both our wages and working conditions is to show solidarity with not only workers of the various trades within construction; but also with workers of other industries. Solidarity means having a true understanding of the old saying, <b>An injury to one is an injury to all</b>.</p>
<p>Solidarity is also the action that springs from this understanding. The greatest action of solidarity that one can follow is the exercising of the <b>right to not cross any picket lines</b>.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that times are hard. The construction industry has been hit especially hard, and many brothers and sisters in the trades are not working. This means that what little work we get, we desperately need.
However, as construction workers; we also understand that <b>in these hard times, we must act and be stronger than ever before!</b> For hundreds of years, construction worker have fought long and hard battles, through many recessions, to reach the level of pay and the amount of power we have on the job. We certainly should not let this recession destroy the progress we have made.</p>
<p>The Construction Workers Organizing Committee and the construction workers of the IWW promise to continue to not cross picket lines! No matter what union or what industry, we will continue to act out solidarity and exercise our rights under <u>section 7 of the NLRA</u>: to act in concert with fellow workers to uphold the best interest of the working class. We urge all construction workers to do the same!</p>
<p><b>Who we are:</b> The Construction Workers Organizing Committee or CWOC is a subordinate body of the Industrial Workers of the World. Our aim is to organize ALL construction workers into ONE democratic fighting union.
