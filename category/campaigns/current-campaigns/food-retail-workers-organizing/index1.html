</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/19/2015 - 5:38pm</p>
<p><strong>By Communications Officer - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/" target="_blank">Bristol IWW</a>, November 14, 2015</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/DSCN1107-300x225.jpg" alt="" />Fellow Wobblies and supporters, Bristol Communications Officer here to report on the wet but very successful solidarity demo held this morning in Bristol outside Cafe Amore!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We organised the demo in solidarity with Fellow Worker Bonny, who worked at Cafe Amore for a while and was not paid the full wages she was owed after quitting. Bristol IWW union representative assisted her in writing a demand letter to the cafe&rsquo;s boss, which Bonny then delivered by hand a week ago accompanied by fellow Wobblies. During the week, the boss paid her some of the money she was owed but not all of it, and didn&rsquo;t provide a clear explanation as to why he couldn&rsquo;t pay the whole amount, and when he would do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So, on we went this Saturday to hold a solidarity demo demanding the cafe&rsquo;s boss to pay Bonny her wages, as well as to highlight the bad practices that Cafe Amore use on their staff &ndash; unpaid trials, underpaying migrant staff, and forced unpaid overtime. </strong>Despite the relentless rain, we had a very successful demonstration attended by around 30 people, with many members and supporters of the IWW, and members of Bristol SolNet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before the start of the demo, Bonny went in the cafe accompanied by her union rep and other members of the IWW to renew her demand and hand out flyers to customers. The boss was very aggressive towards them, making excuses as to why he hadn&rsquo;t been able to pay Bonny&rsquo;s full wages, and being very vague as to when he would pay her the remaining amount. He then went on to tell another IWW member who was trying to talk to customers to &ldquo;get out of here or I&rsquo;ll beat you up&rdquo; in front of all the customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We stood outside the cafe for an hour, handing out flyers and singing songs in support of Bonny, and having lots of fun Wobbly-style! Lots of passers-by stopped to ask us what was going on and expressed interest and support for Bonny and what we were doing. But, Cafe Amore&rsquo;s boss still hasn&rsquo;t paid Bonny all the money she&rsquo;s owed! Bristol IWW will carry on holding weekly solidarity demos outside Cafe Amore until Bonny&rsquo;s paid up all the money she&rsquo;s owed. <strong>Keep checking our blog and, especially, our Facebook page and Twitter feed (links on the right) and, if Bonny still doesn&rsquo;t get paid, see you on Saturday 21 November at 12pm outside Cafe Amore</strong> (which is on Nelson Street, next to Holland &amp; Barrett). Or, as we put it today in our chants: Pay Bonny her money and we&rsquo;ll go away / Pay Bonny her money or we&rsquo;re here to stay!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Do you also work in the bar &amp; hospitality sector &ndash; bars, pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, catering, etc? Does any of this sound familiar to you? The IWW has just launched a campaign to support and organise workers in these businesses. You can read our statement here:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/iww-bar-hospitality-workers-campaign/"> statement</a>.</strong> <strong>We have also written an article on local paper &ldquo;The Bristol Cable&rdquo; highlighting the issues of bar &amp; hospitality workers in Bristol. You can read it here:<a target="_blank" href="http://thebristolcable.org/2015/11/is-your-waiter-fair-trade-and-ethically-sourced/#"> article.</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>If Bonny&rsquo;s situation sounds familiar to you, and you need help and support to stand up to bully bosses who don&rsquo;t pay wages and treat their workers like doormats, email us at <em>bristol@iww.org.uk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are a grassroots union that uses direct action methods to support workers to fight back for their rights. This is what we can offer you: training to know Employment Law and (where possible) use it to get what you want; training to represent your Fellow Workers in grievance and disciplinary meetings; training to organise your co-workers so you can speak as one voice, and get more influence over what goes on at work; and, finally, TRAINING TO WIN &ndash; better terms and conditions, better pay, and less bullying from your boss!</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/19/2015 - 5:28pm</p>
<p><strong>By Phinneas Gage - <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/11/06/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-iii/">Recomposition</a>, November 6, 2015</strong></p>
<p><i><img width="320" height="238" align="right" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/foodservwork_1.jpg" />This is the third part of a series of concrete examples (<a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/08/27/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-i/" class="bb-url">Part I</a> &ndash; <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/10/08/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-ii/" class="bb-url">Part II</a>) and very brief summaries of organizations that have some component of direct action and a form of collective bargaining that operate outside the labour relations framework. The following examples are from the IWWs organising efforts in food service. This includes fast food as well as grocery stores in a lot of the examples the IWW actually engaged in innovative organising that broke ground in more high profile campaigns like the well known &ldquo;Fight for Fifteen&rdquo; campaigns around raising the minimum wage in the USA. </i></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight:bold">4. The IWW in Food Service</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">a). The Jimmy John&rsquo;s Workers Union</span></p>
<p>The Jimmy John&rsquo;s Workers Union started as an effort by the Twin Cities General Membership Branch of the IWW to organise in Fast Food. The campaign at it&rsquo;s height had shop committees in multiple shops and a city wide committee. Ultimately, the campaign made a decision to go for an NLRB election and only failed by two votes with 85 in favour and 87 against. After that point the campaign went into steep decline but the organisers still managed to create an impressive track record of gains for themselves and their co-workers including: reversing decisions by management to fire people, addressing health and safety concerns for delivery drivers, tips jars, a city wide pay raise, and scheduling issues as well as countless smaller individual grievances in their shops. There is still an underground IWW presence in many shops across the USA and a very public campaign in Baltimore.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Advantages</span>: Large numbers of workers mobilised. A city wide organisation spanning at all ten shops in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota) at its height. Coordination through city wide mass meetings. The media work on this campaign was impressive including making the <span style="font-style:italic">New York Times</span>. Impressive gains before, during, and after the failed certification election.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Disadvantages</span>: Campaign wasn&rsquo;t merely oriented towards a youth counter culture, it celebrated it and was itself a function of it. Substance abuse on the campaign was a major issue and led to key organisers putting their jobs at risk and getting injured unnecessarily. Logistically it was very lax with campaign data, mostly being kept in the personal notebooks of key organisers. Many organisers were also goal oriented to the point of certification becoming an all or nothing proposition and the campaign slowly contracted as key people moved on to other projects after the certification campaign failed, despite efforts to downplay the legal process by some organisers. As well the ability to join the JJWU campaign but not the IWW also created a tiered membership that made it ambiguous as to who was actually a member and difficult to consolidate membership beyond just the shop. Ultimately failed to bridge some of the demographic divides in the industry.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">What happened?</span><br />
There is still an underground IWW presence in some shops across the USA and a very public campaign in Baltimore. After the certification election six key organisers were fired over a publicity stunt involving a fight for sick days and the NLRB process is now on its last appeal several years later. The campaign is an impressive achievement for an all volunteer union on a shoe string budget.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">b). The Starbucks Workers Union</span></p>
<p>Where the Jimmy John&rsquo;s Workers Union in the Twin Cities peaked at a failed certification election the Starbucks Workers Union really got going after a failed attempt at certification. In 2003 wobblies started organising at a Starbucks in Manhattan. In 2004 they tried for a union certification election. The National Labour Relations Board defined their bargaining unit as every Starbucks in Manhattan. which for an organising committee of only a handful became unfeasible as it would include hundreds of workers. So the campaign chose to continue outside of the recognition framework. Since that time over a decade ago the SWU has ran campaigns in dozens of cities going public in towns like New York, Chicago, Quebec, Minneapolis and Dallas. Countless underground committees have pushed back against management to rack up impressive wins like: changes to scheduling practices, enforcing the right to take bathroom breaks, winning a two dollar an hour raise for all Starbucks workers in New York, and improvements to health and safety. Perhaps their greatest achievement was winning Martin Luther King Day as a paid day off in the USA for all Starbucks workers, many of whom are African American. The union has also won countless small victories overturning discipline, fighting against sexual harassment and discrimination at work and extending international solidarity to Baristas in Chile. The union has made national press several times and has won several labour relations board rulings cementing some legal recourse to unions that exist outside the contract and certification process.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Advantages</span>: Extremely fluid organisation allowed for rapid expansion to other cities and shops without too much red tape. The campaign can coordinate demands over multiple cities and countries. Strong emphasis on direct action, the campaign has repeatedly avoided certification elections since the initial defeat in New York and has since developed a strong practice of shop floor unionism.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Disadvantages</span>: Like other IWW efforts in Fast Food the campaign suffers from a high turnover in their workforce and all the problems that come from that. The campaign was logistically lax at some points but fairly strong at others. Part of their very fluid structure made creating democratic structures and decision making difficult. The campaign also had a tendency to go public with a small minority in the shop. Part of this was due to a reliance, probably an over reliance, on media tactics. These strategic decisions put a tremendous amount of strain on key personalities and also create problems as far as giving credit to other people, creating an investment on the part of the less high profile activists, and bringing constant scrutiny and attention from management. Also when the Quebec wobblies joined the SWU from an already existing union formation things quickly fell apart due to differing emphases on direct action and a greater reliance on certification votes (which failed) in Canada. Ultimately the organisers quit en mass and called it direct action.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">What happened?</span><br />
The IWW still has organising activity at Starbucks stores all over North America and a public presence in New York that is going on twelve years this year.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 01/20/2013 - 4:43pm</p>
<p>Richmond, Va - On behalf of Rain Burroughs, the Richmond, Virginia General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and Food &amp; Retail Workers United (FRWU) delivered a formal letter to Rick Hood (owner) and Tommy Langford (store manager) on December 21, 2012 requesting that Ellwood Thompson's Local Market reinstate Rain Burroughs immediately to an equivalent job with comparable pay, benefits, responsibilities, and hours of work. We have yet to receive any response, and we ask for your support.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Rain Burroughs was granted, via the federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), leave in order to assist her mother who was struggling with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Burroughs' leave ended on November 20, 2012 when she returned to work at Ellwood Thompson's Local Market. Rather respect a loyal worker and honoring the commitment that had been made to them, Ellwood Thompson's chose to label Burroughs as a new hire and placed her on 'probation'. This action by Ellwood Thompson's violates federal law which<br />
