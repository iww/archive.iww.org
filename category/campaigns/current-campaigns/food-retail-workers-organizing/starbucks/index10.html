<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/starbuckslogo2.jpg" align="right" /><strong>Media Statement delivered January 7:</strong> Faced with the prospect of losing
another trial in front of the National Labor Relations Board the
Regional Director has agreed to let Starbucks settle the charges
against them and forego the trial that was to begin today. The union is
upset that the Board is agreeing to accept another Starbucks settlement
in Grand Rapids instead of holding them accountable in open court. If
this most recent settlement is approved it will be 3rd one allowed by
the board in Grand Rapids. With the signing of each settlement
Starbucks has said they would end their anti-union intimidation and
each time it has continued unabated. We can be sure it will continue
which is why union membership is so vital.<br />
<br />
Had the trial gone on here today in Grand Rapids we would have detailed
the same type of union busting activity that Starbucks was found guilty
of a couple weeks ago in New York. Internal communications would have
been admitted into evidence showing upper management discussions about
union organizing in Grand Rapids and speculation about barista's union
sympathies. The same type of surveillance and monitoring that was going
on in New York. Also, Starbucks selectively enforced the attendance
policy, scheduled baristas based on their union sympathies, and gave me
less in raises because of my union affiliation. Based on the evidence
that would have been presented its unbelievable that Howard Schultz
doesn't have knowledge of the huge anti-union operation in place at
Starbucks. Its possible hes directing the whole operation.<br />
<br />
On July 5th of last year there was a Global Day of Action against
Starbucks called by the Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union and the
Seville (Spain) CNT. The Day of Action was called after Monica was
fired from a Starbucks in Seville and I was fired here in Grand Rapids.
Over 200 Starbucks were picketed in over 80 cities in 20 countries. We
have a message from the CNT with an update of Monica's situation.<br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_272 active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Starbucks campaign.

</p>
<p>
About a dozen former and current Starbucks workers gathered outside
the coffee chain’s outlet at the intersection of Nicollet and Franklin
avenues on Thursday morning, circling on the sidewalk in the
single-digit temperatures and carrying placards that read “Justice for
Baristas” and “Starbucks Workers Union.”
</p>
<p>
“Starbucks Union here to stay,” they chanted. “These lattes are union-made.”
</p>
<p>
The event coincided with the filing of 11 labor violation charges
against the company with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
Among the accusations against the ubiquitous coffee retailer: Employees
were illegally fired or punished for engaging in union activities;
store managers wrongly prohibited discussions of organizing efforts at
work; and pro-union workers were spied on by management.
</p>
<p>
“Starbucks has flagrantly violated the National Labor Relations Act
on countless occasions,” said Aaron Kocher, an employee at the Nicollet
Avenue shop.

<div>
Statement of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union on the Purchase of a $45
Million Corporate Jet by Starbucks
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;The IWW Starbucks Workers Union is appalled that Starbucks spent $45
million on a new corporate jet so that CEO Howard Schultz could spend the
holidays in Hawaii glad-handing sports superstars while baristas and shift
supervisors are denied the work hours they need to make ends meet in the midst
of an economic crisis.  With that $45 million, Starbucks could provide over five
million additional work hours to employees in need or maintain its gutted 401k
program for three additional years.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Starbucks' new corporate jet only seats 19 passengers.  That leaves out
tens of thousands of us so-called partners.  As a company that claims to treat
all of its employees with &quot;respect and dignity&quot;, Starbucks should sell its
extravagant jet and use the money to benefit its workers and their families, not
just senior executives.  Starbucks should start by scaling back painful
across-the-board labor cuts and maintaining a transparent 401k matching plan, so
that workers know what to expect before they put their money away for
decades.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In today's dire economic climate, there is no room for this kind of
corporate extravagance.  Instead of bearing their share of the burden, Starbucks
management has recklessly chosen to further reward their poor performance.  As
Starbucks wastes much needed funds on unnecessary luxuries, it can expect
increased resistance from baristas and shift supervisors seeking job security
and sufficient work hours.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
The IWW Starbucks Workers Union (StarbucksUnion.org) is an organization of
almost 300 current and former employees at the world's largest coffee chain
united for secure work hours, a living wage, and an independent voice on the
job.  Through direct action, public education, and legal advocacy, the union
fights for systemic change at Starbucks and confronts management over unfair
treatment of individual employees.
</div>

<div>
The Industrial Workers of the World (iww.org) is a global grassroots union
open to all working people.

<strong>Starbucks' Legal Troubles Deepen as Union Files Charges with National Labor Relations Board on nearly 30 Rights' Violations</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Twin Cities Baristas to Illustrate Impact of Union-busting with Big &quot;Performance Review&quot; of Starbucks Management</em><br />
<br />
Minneapolis -- On the heels of a landmark decision finding Starbucks guilty of almost 30 labor violations in New York City, the IWW Starbucks Workers Union has slapped the embattled coffee giant with new charges of nearly 30 additional counts of illegal union-busting in Minneapolis/St. Paul. The union alleges that Starbucks broke federal law repeatedly by interrogating workers about union sympathies, instructing supervisors to spy on the union, and disciplining workers for participating in the union. Union baristas plan to deliver a six-month &quot;Performance Review&quot; of Starbucks to regional management to illustrate their disgust.<br />
<br />
Union barista Erik Forman said, &quot;After the guilty verdict in New York City and settlements in the Twin Cities and Grand Rapids, we had hoped that Starbucks would have learned its lesson, but unfortunately, the company has chosen to continue the pattern of illegal union-busting they have established across the US. We will not stand for this, Starbucks must respect our right to organize.&quot;<br />
<br />
In late December, a federal ruling against Starbucks concluded a two-year legal battle between Starbucks and baristas represented by the Industrial Workers of the World labor union in New York City, ordering the reinstatement of three baristas fired for union activity. The ruling parallels recent events in Grand Rapid, MI and the Twin Cities where Starbucks settled two similar Unfair Labor Practice charges.<br />

</div>
<div>
Starbucks has reached a settlement in principle over a Michigan barista
whom the National Labor Relations Board said was fired in June because of his
union activities.
</div>
<br />
<div>
An administrative trial that was scheduled for today has been canceled, and
the agreement is expected to be signed this week, said Chet Byerly, resident
officer for the NLRB in Grand Rapids. He would not disclose details of the
proposed agreement.
</div>
<br />
<div>
A Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed that it is working on a
settlement.
</div>
<br />
<div>
It is the third time in a month that Starbucks has faced action from the
NLRB regarding the Industrial Workers of the World union.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Last month, an NLRB administrative law judge found that Starbucks took part
in unfair labor practices at several of its New York cafes.
