<p><strong>By Julie Jargon - <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, July 6, 2011</strong></p>
<p>In what would be Starbucks Corp.'s first strike at a company-owned store, baristas at the chain's outlets in Chile plan to walk out Thursday because, they say, their wages are so low that they can't afford to buy lunch.</p>
<p>Unionized employees at 30 of Starbucks's 31 Chilean stores plan to walk out for as many as several days, said Andr?s Giordano, president of the union, Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile.</p>
<p>Mr. Giordano, a 24-year-old shift supervisor in Santiago, said the starting hourly wage for Chilean Starbucks workers is the equivalent of $2.50, and it hasn't changed in eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;Lunch in Chile costs $5 to $6,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Chilean workers have been pressing for a lunch stipend since they organized two years ago. Starbucks managers in Chile get a monthly &quot;lunch bonus&quot; of $50, while other employees are offered two free coffees a day. &quot;I would prefer to eat a sandwich,&quot; Mr. Giordano said.</p>
<p>The skirmish underscores one of the challenges U.S.-based companies like Starbucks face as they expand their global footprint. Multinational companies seeking to enter new markets often have to deal with local labor groups and government requirements to honor collective bargaining.</p>
<p>As a condition of merging with African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently agreed to honor union-bargaining agreements for three years.</p>
<p>Starbucks has had to comply with government-mandated participation in collective-bargaining agreements in Brazil and Argentina. The company has also clashed with workers who tried unsuccessfully to organize in Europe and New Zealand, and it has battled with unionized workers in North America, where 300 employees are members of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.</p>

<p><b>The Silent Room Takes Audiences Inside Labor Insurgency in America's Corporate Chains</b></p>
<p>Sneak Preview: 7:30pm July 7th, Zorongo Dance Theater Performance Dates: August 5th-11th in the Minnesota Fringe Fest at the Gremlin Theater.</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS-- When a coworker at Starbucks approached barista Ted Dewberry about forming a union at their workplace, his initial reaction was fear. Working 17 hour days at Starbucks and IKEA to pay off decades-old film school student loans, Ted was in no position to risk his job. He reluctantly agreed to come to a meeting, but only to listen. Little did he know the decision would change his life. In the months that followed, Ted and his coworkers faced down a campaign of intimidation coordinated by Starbucks' anti-union consultants at the Akin Gump law firm, won improved working conditions at their store, and helped spark a retail workers movement that continues to grow with unionization campaigns at Jimmy John's, Target, Walmart, the Apple Store, and other corporate juggernauts.</p>
<p>An independent filmmaker in his limited free time, Dewberry decided to tell the story of what happens when you say &quot;union yes.&quot; The result is &quot;The Silent Room,&quot; a new music-laced expos&eacute; of the misery of the corporate retail workplace. The name of the show is inspired by a special room in the Twin Cities IKEA for workers to go to when they have a nervous breakdown on the job.</p>

<p>The decline of unions does not mean the end of the labor movement. Indeed, the last few years have seen a proliferation of new kinds of worker organizations and workers' rights campaigns. Some of the most exciting of late have been conducted by community-based groups (rather than workplace-based unions), such as the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and those part of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.pmpress.org/content/article.php/20080722202202555"><em>Solidarity Unionism at Starbucks</em></a>, a recent pamphlet published by PM Press, Daniel Gross and Staughton Lynd highlight an increasingly important feature of today&rsquo;s labor movement&mdash;nonunion workers using direct action strategies protected by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)&mdash;while examining the <a href="../../../../../">Industrial Workers of the World</a>&rsquo;s (IWW)'s ongoing efforts to organize Starbucks.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/3/31/starbucks-union-locke-students/">By Mercer R. Cook - <i>The Harvard Crimson</i>, March 31, 2011</a> - reprinted according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">Fair Use</a> guidelines.</p>
<p>Harvard students, union members, and Starbucks employees from around the country are planning to protest a lecture by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz at Harvard Business School on Friday.</p>
<p>Schultz will be speaking to several hundred Business School students on his experiences running a successful business while also be promoting his new book, &ldquo;Onward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Libert&eacute; Locke, an organizer of the event, said Starbucks employees are angered by what they deem to be hypocrisy in Schultz&rsquo;s book, in which he expresses his commitment to his &ldquo;partners&rdquo;&mdash;as the company calls its workers. Employees of the company, especially union members, feel that Starbucks is one of the least labor friendly companies in America, Locke said. Starbucks has been found guilty by the National Labor Relations Board of violating labor rights, including charges of union busting and wrongful termination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Howie [Schultz] to sit around and claim how much he loves us, it&rsquo;s just disgusting,&rdquo; said Locke, a Starbucks barista and Starbucks Workers Union organizer from New York. &ldquo;Starbucks is one of the biggest union busting corporations in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvard union representatives said they planned to support Starbucks workers in the protest.</p>
<p>Geoffrey &ldquo;Geoff&rdquo; Carens, an assistant librarian and member of the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers, emphasized what he called the &ldquo;phoniness&rdquo; of Schultz&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howard Schultz likes to present Starbucks as a socially responsible corporation,&rdquo; Carens said. &ldquo;In reality, conditions are really bad and getting worse.&rdquo;</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 01/23/2011 - 3:02pm</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/sbuxLogocat3.jpg" align="right" />On Monday, January 17, 2011, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, while baristas at the Astor Place Starbucks in Manhattan were declaring their membership in the IWW, members of the IWW and supporters descended on Starbucks throughout the United States to wish baristas a happy Martin Luther King day. As part of these greetings, IWW organizers informed baristas of the recent victory won by IWW Starbucks baristas in securing time-and-one-half holiday premium for working on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.</p>
<p>The victory came after a spirited three-year initiative of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) which made public the company's second-class treatment of Dr. King's birthday and called on the coffee giant to pay the same premium that it pays workers on six other federal holidays. After Starbucks refused to change its policy, union workers and their supporters launched a determined campaign of grassroots actions in Starbucks stores and communities all across the country in support of equal treatment for MLK Day. (For more information, see related article: <a href="../../../../../node/5270/" target="_blank">Starbucks Baristas Win Equal Treatment for MLK Day After Three Year Union Fight</a>.</p>
<p>IWW members visited Starbucks and talked with baristas in hundreds of cities throughout the US.</p>
<p>All in all, the effort was a huge success. Workers were positive and appreciative, and it shows that solidarity unionism and international solidarity is still a very effective strategy.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World union effort at Starbucks is the first time a labor organization in the United States has succeeded in building a base of organized baristas at the company. With over 300 worker-organizers across the country and growing, the SWU has consistently chalked up victories at Starbucks including across-the-board raises, more secure work hours, and respectful treatment from previously abusive managers whose conduct improved due to union pressure campaigns. The SWU has repeatedly prevailed against Starbucks in the legal arena across multiple cities including in a lengthy New York City trial over pervasive illegal union-busting, the first time the company had to square off against baristas in open court regarding unfair labor practices.</p>
<p>The IWW Starbucks campaign is just beginning.
