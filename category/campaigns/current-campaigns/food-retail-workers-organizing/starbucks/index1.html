<p><em>Libert&eacute; Locke, a Starbucks Workers Union organizer, writes about how violence at work and in our personal lives are similar, how domestic abusers and bosses use the same techniques of control and that we need to fight both. </em></p>

<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/LLSB.jpg" />I was raped by a boyfriend on August 18th, 2006. The very next day I held back tears while I lied to a stranger over the phone about why I was unavailable to go in that day for a second interview for a job that I desperately needed. When I hung up the phone I saw a new text message. It was from him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over. It will never be over between us&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day I went in for the second interview. It was inside of the Sears Tower Starbucks in Chicago. I took the train to the interview constantly looking around me and shaking. I needed work. I had just been fired from Target two weeks prior and had no prospects. I knew I would have to go through a metal detector in order to enter the building so despite every instinct in my body I did not bring a knife with me.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">&ldquo;What would you do if you caught a coworker stealing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>My mind is racing. I&rsquo;m thinking that I risked my safety by leaving my house for a stupid job that pays $7.75/hr. Aren&rsquo;t I worth more than that? Aren&rsquo;t we all worth so much more?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell management right away, of course. I&rsquo;ve never understood why someone would steal from work&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I tell them what they want me to.</p>
<p>I started working at Starbucks on August 22, 2006. That was a little over five years ago. Every year we have annual reviews where I generally get to argue with someone younger than me who makes significantly more than do about why my hard work, aching back, cracking hands, sore wrists, the bags under my eyes, the burns, the bruises on my arms, the cuts on my knees, the constant degrading treatment by the customers, the &ldquo;baby, honey, sugar, bitch&rdquo;, the &ldquo;hey, you, slut&hellip;I said NO whip cream!&rdquo;s, the staring, the following after work&hellip;I get to argue why all that means I&rsquo;m worth a 33cent raise rather than 22cents, Degrading for any worker. Degrading especially for a woman worker. Only for me, I get to do this every year just four days after the anniversary of when someone I was in love with raped me. My annual review is truly the only reason I&rsquo;m reminded of the anniversary of the assault.</p>

<p>Last month, Tiffany White,an African American mother of two, and union leader and organizer with the Industrial Workers of the World Starbucks Workers Union, was terminated without justification from a New York Starbucks.<br />
<br />
The practice of targeting female union members continues in Nebraska, with recent threats to union organizer Sasha McCoy. McCoy, also an African American mother of two,was recently threatened with termination when she reduced her availability at the 15th and Douglas Starbucks so she could return to school to pursue a B.S. in biology.<br />
<br />
McCoy's new schedule meets all of the requirements outlined in the corporate scheduling policy. McCoy also spoke with representatives from Partner Resources, the H.R. branch of the Starbucks Corporation, who informed McCoy that her new availability met the company's requirements.<br />
<br />
Despite her efforts to follow proper procedure, McCoy was told by manager Scott Creed that if she did not add an additional 30 minutes to her weekly availability, she would be terminated after four years of service to the Starbucks corporation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I am being targeted right now because I am part of the union,&quot; says McCoy. &quot;My commitment to my job was never questioned until I joined the union. I'm a single mother working to put myself through college on my own so I can improve my life for my family. A company that claims to support women in the workplace is threatening to put me out of a job over half an hour. This has nothing to do with my availability and everything to do with my union.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the 14th of August members of the Industrial Workers of the World Nebraska General Membership Branch confronted Creed with an Unfair Labor Practice charge, alleging intimidation to union members for his threat to fire McCoy. Two months ago, Starbucks settled three Unfair Labor Practice charges regarding anti union practices that had taken place at the 15th and Douglas and 72nd and Dodge Starbucks locations in Omaha.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 08/01/2011 - 5:37pm</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/DSCN2475_0.jpg" />San Francisco--On Friday, July 29th members of the Bay Area Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) introduced San Francisco's financial district to the global action campaign against Starbucks union busting and the inspiring militancy of Starbucks union workers on strike in Chile.</p>
<p>The Wobbly flyering squad spoke to more than 50 downtown Starbucks workers and over 500 hundred customers. Both workers and customers were appalled to learn of the miserable working conditions of baristas in Chile and recent union-busting by Starbucks in New York. They were also shocked, yet excited to know that, in addition to the El Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks en Chile (Starbucks Workers Union in Chile), Starbucks baristas in North America have organized with the IWW, where workers continue to inspire shop floor solidarity and to fight for better working conditions at Starbucks everywhere.</p>
<p>After becoming aware of the recent firing of Starbucks union barista Tiffany White-Thomas and the terrible treatment of Chilean workers, several customers made it clear they would no longer buy coffee from Starbucks. Many customers also said they intend to call Starbucks to tell them that their recent union-busting is unacceptable, and to inform the company that they support the Starbucks workers'?struggle here in the U.S. and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>July 22. 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Union</strong><strong> Seeks to Hold Starbucks Accountable for their </strong><strong>Union</strong><strong> Busting at Home and Abroad</strong></p>
<p>N<strong>EW YORK</strong><strong> &ndash; </strong>Monday, July 25th, the IWW Starbucks Workers Union will launch a Global Week of Action in support of their separate but sister union El Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks en Chile (Starbucks Workers Union in Chile).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 200 baristas and shift supervisors that work in the 32 Chilean Starbucks locations went on strike on July 7th.&nbsp; They are striking in an effort to have their demands met.&nbsp; Their most crucial demand is earning a higher wage.&nbsp; Currently baristas at Starbucks in Chile make $2.50/hr. while the drinks are still sold for US prices, and they haven&rsquo;t received raises in 8 years.&nbsp; The baristas are also asking for a lunch stipend in order to eat during their shifts, this is something managers in Chile are provided.</p>
<p>Two weeks, to the day, after the strike began a New York City barista and mother of two young children was fired for announcing her membership in the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.&nbsp; The company gave no official reason for her termination but did fire her when she refused to meet with higher ups without her attorney and union representative present, which was a previous agreement between the union and management.&nbsp; Tiffany White-Thomas has worked at the Canal/Broadway Starbucks for over two years. She was up for a promotion when her store manager, Rafael Fox, told her that, being a mother, she would not have the time necessary to dedicate to the company so he would not be promoting her.&nbsp; A letter given to Tiffany&rsquo;s managers made reference to the collective efforts of the IWW Starbucks Union and the Chilean Strikers.&nbsp; Both unions feel that that this solidarity across borders&nbsp; is seen as a threat to the company and is, in part, what led to Tiffany&rsquo;s termination.</p>
<p>In New York City, the first solidarity action will be a press conference and picket in front of the Canal and Broadway Starbucks location, 405 Broadway between Walker and Canal St., starting at 12pm on Monday, July 25th.&nbsp; The IWW is demanding full reinstatement of Tiffany White-Thomas and that Starbucks negotiate in good faith with their brothers and sisters of El Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks en Chile.</p>
<p>Similar actions in support of the Chilean Strikers are expected in various cities throughout the US and the world throughout next week.</p>
<p>The IWW Starbucks Workers Union is a grassroots organization composed entirely of current and former Starbucks employees who have fought for respect, security, affordable health care and a living wage since 2004. Working together, SWU members have improved working conditions for Starbucks employees and won legal victories against unfair labor practices.</p>
