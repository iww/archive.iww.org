<p>Starbucks is adamantly anti-union. Daniel Gross found that out the hard way. This weekend, Gross was fired, fellow employees say, after trying for three years to organize his fellow workers at 17th and Broadway, in Manhattan. Gross is the fourth union activist to be fired from the company this year. The workers will continue trying to organize with the IWW (yes, the Wobblies live!) and have some suggestions on how you can help support their campaign, including boycotting Starbucks until it changes its union-busting ways.</p><p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/s/thenation/20060807/cm_thenation/15108956" target="_blank">Read the entire article</a>. &nbsp;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

<p>Daniel Gross, 27, has spent the last three years trying to organize his fellow Starbucks baristas into the Industrial Workers of the World ( I wrote about him last spring in <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12060/">New York Magazine</a>.) He has reached some success at at least three Starbucks in Manhattan, and others elsewhere, despite vociferous opposition from management.</p> <p>The overwhelmingly young members of his union are stuck, like millions of teens and 20somethings nationwide, in low-wage, mostly dead-end food service jobs with unpredictable hours and rigid codes of behavior. Some are trying to work their way through college, others have families to support; all of them have this strange idea that they deserve better conditions and prospects. They have embraced the radical socialism of the One Big Union ( the one that brought you Joe Hill and &quot;Pie in the Sky&quot;) , now just a shadow of its former self, because of its decentralized, democratic structure and its uncompromising ethos of solidarity. &ldquo;The IWW is basically a fan club for anarchists and labor geeks,&rdquo; one barista told me. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re making it into something real.&rdquo;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
