</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 01/18/2011 - 3:02am</p>
<p><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Starbucks Workers Union (Industrial Workers of the World). Contact: Zelig Stern, 508-524-2118; Cason Bolton, Jr, 702-490-1732</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/SbuxAstorsm.jpg" align="right" />NEW YORK, NY –On this the 25th anniversary of Dr. King’s holiday, baristas at the Astor Place Starbucks in Manhattan declared their membership in the 105 year old union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a staunch and outspoken defender of workers’ rights including the right to a living wage and the right to join a labor union.</p>
<p>The baristas represent the latest group of workers at the coffee giant to join the ongoing struggle for a living wage, more consistent scheduling, more affordable health insurance, and to be treated with basic respect and dignity by management. “I am proud to join the growing ranks of retail workers organizing together in the largest and least organized sector of our economy and at a company that has created thousands of low-wage jobs,” expressed Astor Place barista Zelig Stern. In the last year, baristas in Omaha, Nebraska and Ft. Worth, Texas have also joined the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU), showing that workers’ concerns with the company are far-reaching.</p>
<p>“We would just like to be treated like human beings and not machines,” said union barista and Astor Place employee Cason Bolton, Jr. in reference to Starbucks’ latest initiative toward mimicking the factory assembly-line, the “Beverage Repeatable Routine.”</p>
<p>Today the workers delivered a collectively written demand letter (see below) to the management of the Astor Place Starbucks. Their demands included a one dollar per an hour raise across the board for all store employees. While the company’s total net revenue for FY 2010 increased by 9.5% to $10.7 billion, according to the company’s Financial Report for Nov. 4, 2010, many of the retail location employees aren’t able to make ends meet with their low Starbucks wages and are forced to live below the poverty line, many requiring public assistance.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

<p>The IWW Nebraska General Membership Branch (GMB) files Unfair Labor Practice charging Starbucks Coffee Company with violating Labor Law.<p />
<p>Starbucks Workers Union (Industrial Workers of the World) contact: Samantha Cole (402)669-8479<p />
<p>Omaha- The Starbucks Workers Union is demanding the reinstatement of former employee and union member Tyler Swain after being unjustly terminated.<p />
<p>On Thursday December 30, 2010 Tyler Swain was terminated from his position as a shift supervisor by the downtown Starbucks store manager Scott Creed for ‘insubordination’.<p />
<p>Co-worker and union member Samantha Cole argues otherwise and says that the Starbucks Coffee Company has had a bulls-eye on Swain since they formed the Nebraska Starbucks Workers Union in August. Cole stated, “Tyler has always been a model employee and takes great pride in his job and his relationships he’s developed with our regular customers. Starbucks has been desperately trying to find a reason to get rid of Tyler since we went public with our union and started organizing our district.” She added that, “Customers have noticed and asked where he is. When I tell them that he was terminated they are surprised and say that he is always so friendly and never would have guessed he would be fired for being a bad employee. However, one customer who comes in on a regular basis and had made negative remarks to us when we went public with our union said ‘that’s what he gets for trying to start a union’”.<p />
<p>The Nebraska Starbucks Workers Union went public with their union and organizing drive on August 6th, 2010 by walking off the job and presenting then District Manager Jennifer Rojas with a list of demands which included increasing wages above poverty rates, an inclement weather plan for the district, consistent scheduling and fully stocked First Aid kit in the store as per OSHA regulations among other things.<p />
<p>Union member Sasha McCoy says that Starbucks has been focused on causing discontent among the workers at 15th and Douglas Starbucks by manufacturing lies about Swain. “Shortly after we presented Jenny with our list of demands and went public with our desire to organize a union, Starbucks has been actively trying to accuse Tyler of a number of unethical charges. The Human Resources Department was even accusing Tyler of sexual harrasment when there was nothing like that going on. These charges were absolutely absurd. They were trying to take the focus off of our demands and desire to organize a union and onto make believe charges against Tyler,” said McCoy.<p /></p/></p></p/></p></p/></p></p/></p></p/></p></p/></p></p/></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_694 first"><a href="../../../../branches/all-branches/omaha-gmb/" rel="tag" title="">Omaha GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_272 active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Starbucks campaign.

<a href="../../../../../node/5285/" rel="bookmark">NYC IWW Union Barista Fighting For His Job Back!</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 12/06/2010 - 12:30am</p>
<p>On June 29th, 2010 Park Slope, Brooklyn-based independent coffee shop Ozzie's Coffee & Tea fired IWW union barista Jeff Bauer for engaging in legally protected union activity. The NYC branch of the IWW has been engaged in a fight for justice for Fellow Worker Bauer, both through Direct Action and filing multiple Unfair Labor Practices (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).</p>
<p>FW Jeff Bauer worked at Ozzie's for over a year. He is a hard worker with a strong work ethic. The quality of his labor was never questioned before his IWW union affiliation was leaked to management. In fact, FW Bauer was offered the General Store Manager position before it was given to Rafael Bernadine. Jeff turned down the management position on principle, as it went against his political beliefs as both an anarchist and a wobbly. “I do not want to have authority over other people’s lives any more than I want people to have authority over my life,” recalls Jeff as to why he turned down the much higher paying position.</p>
<p>Jeff was often praised by management and coworkers for how hard he worked until word got out that he helped book a benefit for the NYC branch of the IWW on May Day of 2010. When management was made aware Jeff Bauer was organizing with the One Big Union their response was harsh. Jeff was subjected to mistreatment, harassment and verbal abuse at the hands of the General Store Manager, Raphael Bernadine.</p>
<p>FW Bauer came under extreme scrutiny, was demoted as a key-holder and suffered a severe cut in hours when he stood up for a coworker. The coworker had been physically assaulted and threatened by the General Store Manager's boyfriend on the shop floor. Along with the demotion and slashed hours (from over 40 to below 20), FW Bauer was written up in what management termed “a first and final warning.” The warning was for discussing workplace conditions, which is protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). In response FW Bauer led a legally protected union delegation of six people into the store to demand his hours back, his warning be retracted in writing, and for General Store Manager Raphael Bernadine to be reprimanded for his mistreatment of workers. The other purpose of this March on the Boss was to officially inform Ozzie’s Coffee and Tea of Jeff Bauer’s IWW union affiliation.</p>
<p>Management’s response was one of further retaliation. After Ozzie's co-owner Melissa Azulai received the demand letter, Jeff Bauer was immediately removed from the schedule and then terminated days later. After Jeff was removed from the schedule, he placed several unreturned calls to Ms. Azulai, who never informed Jeff personally, that he was fired. He had to find out from his friend, comrade and legal advisor Daniel Gross.</p>
<p>In a related note, Daniel Gross, along with legendary First Amendment litigator Martin Garbus, is currently defending the former workers of another well-known Park Slope coffee establishment, Gorilla Coffee. The gourmet, fair-trade coffee shop was shuttered for over two weeks after the entire staff resigned en masse last April over the heavy-handed management style of operations director Carol McLaughlin. The former workers of Gorilla Coffee are being slapped with a retaliatory, anti-speech lawsuit for speaking out about the “perpetually malicious, hostile, and demeaning work environment” at Gorilla Coffee. In a similar move, Ozzie’s Coffee and Tea’s law firm, Livoti, Bernstein & Moraco has threatened the General Headquarters of the IWW with a frivolous anti-speech lawsuit designed to make us cease and desist from engaging in the time-tested tactic of phone call-in actions. We doubt that either Ozzie’s Coffee and Tea, or their corporate lawyers, are familiar with the IWW’s long history of engaging in Free Speech Fights or they would have picked their battles a little more carefully. The IWW fights to win.</p>
<p>Fellow Workers are encouraged to call Ozzie’s Coffee and Tea to demand that Jeff Bauer be reinstated immediately. Ask for Melissa Azulai or Raphael Bernadine. (718)398-6695.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/18/2010 - 2:39pm</p>
<p><b>Employees that Work on Dr. King's Holiday will Receive Time-and-One-Half Holiday Pay</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU660/sbux/memphis_king.jpg" align="right" />November 18, 2010 - Contact: Aaron Kocher, 612-220-6454</p>
<p>New York, NY- Starbucks baristas across the United States for the first time next year will begin receiving a time-and-one-half holiday premium for working on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The move comes after a spirited three-year initiative of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) which made public the company's second-class treatment of Dr. King's birthday and called on the coffee giant to pay the same premium that it pays workers on six other federal holidays. After Starbucks refused to change its policy, union workers and their supporters launched a determined campaign of grassroots actions in Starbucks stores and communities all across the country in support of equal treatment for MLK Day.</p>
<p>Starbucks Union members say this is an especially emotional victory, given that the SWU has long-cited the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a major inspiration. Dr. King, who was assassinated in Memphis while supporting the effort of striking sanitation workers to form a union, was a staunch and outspoken defender of workers' rights including the right to a living wage and the right to join a labor union.</p>
<p>"We're deeply moved to have been able in our modest way to increase respect for Dr. King's legacy while ensuring that Starbucks employees who work on his holiday are fairly compensated," said Anja Witek, a Starbucks barista and SWU member in Minnesota. "This is a great example of what baristas and all low-wage workers can achieve by getting organized and taking direct action in support of workplace justice issues."</p>
<p>While Starbucks claims to 'embrace diversity', it doggedly resisted the SWU's call for equal treatment of MLK Day for three years. The company based its refusal on the claim that its holiday policy was in line with the (abysmally low) standards of the food service sector. The SWU made the case that Starbucks' commitment to diversity was illusory, citing the disproportionate number of workers of color in the lowest-paid positions in the company and its intense exploitation of coffee farmers including the Ethiopian workers who grew some of Starbucks' most expensive beans but received just 2.2% of the retail price.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../../../../../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
