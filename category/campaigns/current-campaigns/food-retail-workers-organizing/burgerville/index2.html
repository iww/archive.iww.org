<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/01/2017 - 7:47pm</p>
<p><strong>Pete Shaw - <a href="http://www.portlandoccupier.org/2017/07/19/11521/" target="_blank"><em>Portland Occupier</em></a>, July 19, 2017</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/BVWU.jpg" width="320" height="480" align="right" alt="" />The shakes&ndash;blackberry, chocolate hazelnut, and pumpkin spice&ndash;come and go. So do the Walla Walla onion rings, waffle fries, and asparagus. But since April of last year, solidarity has always been in season at Burgerville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its formation 15 months ago, the Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU)&ndash;which is supported by the Portland Industrial Workers of the World&ndash;has been organizing for better working conditions on the job, greater benefits, and higher wages. Fighting against a management that promotes the Burgerville corporation as one which supports family values, local farmers, and sustainable practices, but treats its workers no differently than people have come to expect from larger fast food chains such as McDonald&rsquo;s, the Burgerville Workers Union has slowly but surely been gathering steam in its struggle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Burgerville management has so far refused to talk with the union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday July 14, the BVWU took another small but significant step toward pushing Burgerville&rsquo;s management to start negotiating with it. A crowd of over 100 people picketed outside the Burgerville on Southeast 92</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Powell during the early evening, virtually shutting down business at the store. On a hot night when one of the raspberry shakes would have made a delightful treat, only a few customers crossed the picket line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a rally just prior to establishing the line, Mark Medina of the BVWU told the gathered crowd, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna shut down the shop for a couple of hours and make corporate know that workers care about benefits, about wages, and that they want Burgerville to negotiate with the union and respect the rights of workers here in Portland, Oregon. This is a union town. They should respect our rights to organize.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That lack of respect was given official imprimatur when on June 22 Burgerville agreed to pay $10,000 to settle </span><a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-NOI.pdf" data-slimstat="3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charges brought against it by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BOLI) that between August 1 and August 15, 2015 the company willfully &ldquo;failed to provide a meal period of not less than 30 continuous minutes during which the employee is relieved of all duties and/or failed to provide timely meal periods to twenty-eight employees&rdquo; as required by law. Another 16 employees were also denied their 30-minute work-free meal period during a two-week period in December, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to those charges, BOLI found that Burgerville was &ldquo;employing minors under 18 in hazardous and permitted occupation&rdquo; when two 17 year old employees operated a trash compactor which Oregon law has declared &ldquo;hazardous and detrimental to to the health of employees under the age of 18.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All charges pertained to the Burgerville store on NE Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, near the Oregon Convention Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandon Doyle, BVWU Shop Leader at the SE 92</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Powell Burgerville, is one of many Burgerville workers who has seen the company&rsquo;s scarce regard for workers up close and personal. A few months ago Doyle was feeling ill to the point of vomiting while on the job. Instead of allowing him to go home and rest&ndash;as well as not risk getting Burgerville customers sick&ndash;Doyle&rsquo;s manager insisted he remain at work. Fortunately, Doyle and his fellow workers contacted fellow union members from other stores, who then contacted Doyle&rsquo;s manager, eventually resulting in Doyle being allowed to leave and likely helping prevent the spread of what ailed him. They had his back, and Doyle now wants to return the favor.</span></p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 07/18/2017 - 8:28pm</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>By staff - <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/2017/07/burgerville-pays-10000-to-settle-wage-and-hour-violations/" target="_blank"><em>NW Labor Press</em></a>, July 6, 2017</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The Burgerville fast food chain &mdash; target of a 14-month union campaign to improve wages and working conditions &mdash; on June 22 agreed to pay $10,000 to settle charges that it willfully failed to give workers meal and rest breaks as required by law.</p>
<p class="p1 rteleft"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11554" src="../../../../../sites/default/files/images/BWU-logo-black_0.png" width="263" height="300" align="right" alt="" />Oregon law requires employers to provide paid rest periods of at least 10 minutes for each four-hour work period, and a duty-free meal period of at least 30 minutes when employees work six or more hours at a time.</p>
<p class="p1">The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) first <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BOLIletterToBV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> to Burgerville on April 7, 2016, saying it received information that the company may not have been providing rest breaks and meal periods at its Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard restaurant in Portland. The letter asked the company to review its practices and take immediate steps to correct the situation. Burgerville&rsquo;s chief operating officer <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BVletterToBOLI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote back</a> April 18 to say the company had retrained the entire management team and would meet with all 40 employees to make sure they know about the requirement that they take breaks.</p>
<p class="p1">But the practice continued: Two other employees complained in August, and BOLI sent another letter, and opened an investigation. The investigation found that over two-week periods in August and December 2016, managers &ldquo;willfully&rdquo; failed to provide meal periods to 28 and 16 employees respectively. Willful, in this case, is a legal term meaning the company knew about the requirement for meal breaks, and also knew that workers weren&rsquo;t getting them. The agency <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-NOI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> 44 violations total, and assessed $250 per violation, for $11,000 in all. BOLI also found three cases in which minors were performing a hazardous duty &mdash; operating a trash compactor &mdash; and assessed $250 per violation for those.</p>
<p class="p1">On June 2, 2017, the agency issued a notice that it intended to assess civil penalties of $11,750. The Vancouver-based fast food chain <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-FOID-w-Agreed-Settlement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to pay $10,000 to settle all the charges.</p>
<p class="p1">Burgerville Workers Union, affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World, has been campaigning since April 2016 for a $5 an hour raise, affordable health care, and other demands. The Oregon AFL-CIO and half a dozen other labor organizations have endorsed their campaign.</p>

Organized labor under the leadership of the labor bureaucrats has taken a position of trying to maintain social peace at all costs; more interested in keeping a lid on potential worker insurgency than fighting for better wages, conditions, and environmental regulations.</span></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../../../../../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p>As many of you know, on Friday January 6th, union leader Jordan was suspended and accused of violating company policy because his manager gave him a bagel with cream cheese and forgot to ring him up for it. It is clear from the communications Jordan has received from HR, and the fact that he has been left off the schedule for two weeks, that Burgerville is considering firing him. Jordan expects to hear word sometime this week. In response, we are calling for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2018692461691294/">picket to be held at the Convention Center Burgerville on Wednesday, January 25th at 6:30pm before the Lakers-Blazers Game</a>.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_932 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="" class="active">Burgerville</a></li></ul> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../../../../../content/portland-or-fast-food-chain-burgerville-union-busting-against-iww-organizer/" title="Read the rest of Portland, OR: Fast-Food Chain Burgerville Union Busting against IWW Organizer.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/26/2016 - 8:35pm</p>
<p><strong>By Arun Gupta - <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/19576/beyond_the_fight_for_15_the_worker_led_fast_food_campaign_at_burgerville/">In These Times</a>, October 25, 2016</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/working/bv_850_638.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="240" alt="" />Last year, at age 17, Eli Fishel moved out of her parents&rsquo; house in Vancouver, Washington, squeezing into a three-bedroom apartment with five other roommates. To pay her bills as she finished high school, Fishel landed a job at <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/about/">Burgerville</a>, a fast-food chain with 42 outlets and more than <a href="http://www.bcigroup.com/customer-stories/burgerville">1,500 employees</a> in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Founded in 1961, Burgerville has cultivated a loyal following by <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/about/">emphasizing</a> fresh, local food, combined with sustainable business practices like renewable energy and recycling. But Fishel quickly realized she wasn&rsquo;t part of Burgerville&rsquo;s commitment to &ldquo;regional vitality&rdquo; and &ldquo;future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After 16 months on the job, she earns just $9.85 an hour, barely above the Washington State minimum wage. Her hours and shifts fluctuate weekly, with only a few days&rsquo; notice, and every month she goes hungry because she runs out of money to buy food.</p>
<p>Speaking of the privately-owned Burgerville, Fishel says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re poor because they&rsquo;re rich, and they&rsquo;re rich because we&rsquo;re poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disgruntled Burgerville workers began covertly organizing in 2015. The <a href="http://www.burgervilleworkersunion.org/">Burgerville Workers Union</a> (BVWU) <a href="http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/apr/26/burgerville-workers-union-raises/">went public</a> on April 26 with a march of more than 100 people through Portland, Oregon, and the delivery of a letter to the corporate headquarters in Vancouver. BVWU demands include a $5-an-hour raise for all hourly workers, recognition of a workers organization, affordable, quality healthcare, a safe and healthy workplace, and fair and consistent scheduling with ample notice.</p>
<p>Some BVWU members call their effort &ldquo;Fight for $15, 2.0,&rdquo; playing off the name of the fast-food worker campaign launched in 2011 by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).</p>
<p>SEIU has won plaudits for making the plight of low-wage workers a national issue and igniting the movement for new laws boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour. But the campaign has not, thus far, included efforts to unionize individual workplaces.</p>
<p>Unlike Fight for $15, which Middlebury College sociology professor and labor expert Jamie McCallum describes as &ldquo;a fairly top-down campaign,&rdquo; BVWU is a worker-initiated and -led project backed by numerous labor organizations. The group of Burgerville workers who came up with the idea includes members of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a militant union with West Coast roots that date back to the early 1900s. The campaign has the backing of the Portland chapter of IWW and the support SEIU Local 49, the Portland Association of Teachers, and Jobs with Justice.</p>
<p>This scrappy approach enabled BVWU to leapfrog Fight for $15 by declaring a union from the start. While BVWU has not yet formally petitioned for recognition and Burgerville has not chosen to voluntarily negotiate with it, the union has established worker committees in five stores, is developing units in a similar number of shops and counts scores of workers as members.</p>
<p>BVWU is full of lessons in how organizing works. One member likens the campaign to &ldquo;low-level guerrilla warfare&rdquo; with workers maneuvering to increase their ranks, build power on the shop floor, expand the terrain from shop to shop, while skirmishing with managers over the work process, and suffering casualties as some members have quit or say they were pushed out of their jobs at Burgerville. In the workplace, the strategy is to develop leaders, form committees for each store, and nurture trust and respect between workers. Outside, BVWU uses direct action to empower workers and bring suppliers into the conversation. The union also works to build community support by mobilizing social-justice groups, clergy, and organized labor to win over the public and pressure the company.</p>
<p>McCallum says that BVWU an example of social movement unionism. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about organizing as a class against another class,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to win demands not just against a single boss or to change a law, but to engage in class struggle.&rdquo;</p>
