<p>Fellow Workers from the Seattle IWW Industrial Union local 650 (IU650) at Grassroots Campaigns (GCI) are facing an illegal office closure by the GCI bosses in retaliation for an Unfair Labor Practice Strike action protesting egregious labor violations. Just under a week after the office closed, Wobblies at the Seattle GCI job branch called for a National Day of Action on Friday, August 10th. Wobblies in other GCI offices around the country are starting to face increased heat from management&rsquo;s aggressive union busting. Most are fighting back &ndash; and winning. Here&rsquo;s a quick roundup from each of the seven actions.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/01/2018 - 7:43pm</p>
<p><strong>By Seattle IWW - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/iww-canvassers-on-strike-nationwide-actions-in-support/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, July 31, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/xGroup1.jpeg.pagespeed.ic.19IPM4Db9d/" width="320" height="213" align="right" alt="" />Grassroots Campaigns, Inc. (GCI) is a nationwide, for-profit canvassing contractor which fundraises for progressive nonprofits. GCI canvassers can be seen on countless street corners in large cities and college towns, talking to folks about groups like Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and Doctors Without Borders. Despite the company&rsquo;s claims of a &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; platform, its record of worker abuse and union busting is extensive.</p>
<p>For several years now, GCI workers have attempted to organize with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Building interest has not been too much of a challenge, since idealistic folks get recruited for &ldquo;organizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;activist&rdquo; jobs, but soon find that miserable conditions lead to high turnover rates. New hires are often sympathetic to any drive to bring about change.</p>
<p>The larger hurdle in the past has been how to navigate GCI&rsquo;s blatant disregard for labor law and the challenges of keeping a campaign going in the face of constant attrition. Past drives in Portland and Ann Arbor laid some of the groundwork for how to organize, but ultimately fell short of their goals and provided valuable insight into the company&rsquo;s strategies.</p>
<p>The current campaign, originating in Seattle, has thus far been the most successful. Although workers there have faced countless abuses since going public in February, they have managed to expand the public presence of their IWW IU650 campaign to New Orleans and wider, while building out a network of support and solidarity across the country. A number of small victories so far, such as a $2/hr raise in New Orleans and the resignation of several abusive corporate-installed managers in Seattle, have fueled this rise.</p>
<p>GCI has not made the task of organizing easy. For a week-and-a-half in June, the company illegally locked out its Seattle office in retaliation for a union action demanding better training and onboarding for new hires. The lockout was broken through nationwide direct action and legal threats, but since reopening the company has waged an all-out war on its workers. Workers around the country have been faced with direct sabotage by the company and numerous illegal unilateral changes to working conditions. To top it all off, three workers in different cities were illegally fired in July amidst a cloud of blatant lies and deceptions from the company.</p>
<p>With this latest attack, GCI workers across the country were forced to fight back. On Friday, July 27, Seattle IU650 members kicked things off with a strike against the company&rsquo;s unfair labor practices. In seven other cities, actions took place aimed at building the union&rsquo;s shop-floor presence and forcing the company to do right.</p>
<p>IU650 members are united in demanding the rehiring of all those impacted by the company&rsquo;s illegal union busting, improvements to the company&rsquo;s harsh quota system, and protections in the case of bad weather, street harassment, and other issues that might force canvassers to drop shifts. In addition, they are working to fight unique local challenges ranging from lockouts to laundry.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 07/26/2018 - 8:18pm</p>
<p><strong>Seattle IWW - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/dispatch-from-the-picket-line-iww-fights-lockouts-in-seattle/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, July 25, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Group1.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="213" align="right" />The union drive at Grassroots Campaigns Incorporated (GCI) has been nothing short of profound. Throughout months of organizing we built an unparalleled culture of resistance and solidarity and a tangible sense that we don&rsquo;t need bosses to get work done.</p>
<p>At the beginning of May we realized that something was off. May and June are typically the biggest hiring periods with the office frequently swelling to 40 or 50 canvassers by midsummer. This year, though, the interim directors sent by corporate were simply not bringing in new people.</p>
<p>Thanks to shop floor agitation and legal threats, we were able to force the company to begin hiring by the end of May, but we soon found ourselves with a new problem. New hires were being made Field Managers (FMs) on their fourth or fifth days. FMs are similar to shift leads at other jobs but with extra paperwork, no real power, and often no increase in pay. When new workers should have been learning the skills needed to canvass, they were instead being asked to supervise other people.</p>
<p>These new hires felt like they were being pressured to quit by being given such responsibilities so quickly. They joined the union to do something about it. We sympathized with their issue and decided to March on the Boss on Friday, June 8 to demand that new hires get at least two weeks on the job before being asked to take on FM responsibilities. We reasonably expected the current director would accede to our demand on the spot, but, because of the company&rsquo;s consistent and blatant lawbreaking practices, we wanted to have the agreement in writing, which was something the company was incredibly averse to.</p>
<p>Ten of us, including all of the recent new hires, entered the director&rsquo;s office shortly before our morning circle. We delivered our demand and, as expected, she agreed verbally. She stated that she would get us something in writing by the end of the day but that she needed to talk to Laurie Owen (the company&rsquo;s General Counsel and chief union buster) to find out exactly what she was allowed to write. She agreed that one of our members could stay a bit late while she waited for approval.</p>
<p>Most of the office went out to canvass, and the hours ticked by. By noon it was starting to become clear that Laurie wouldn&rsquo;t give us anything. The director was told to write nothing down, although she was assured she had discretion over the policy to ensure all new hires have at least two weeks on the job before taking on FM responsibilities. At lunchtime, one union member pointed out that because we had received a promise to have something in writing by the end of the day, the day couldn&rsquo;t be over until we had it. We all agreed and decided that if we didn&rsquo;t have something by the time we returned from canvassing we would remain on the clock discussing workplace conditions&nbsp;with our manager until she gave us what she had promised.</p>
<p>After the afternoon debriefs, seven people found themselves in the director&rsquo;s office. For the next four and a half hours, there was continuous discussion about workplace conditions with the manager interspersed with songs and teach&shy;-ins. We were told repeatedly that no one would have to leave or be forced to clock out. At 9:45pm, we finally received a written notice from the manager that she could not commit policy to writing. Having forced a response that would greatly aid in future legal matters, we left feeling elated at the power of direct action.</p>
<p>In IU650, the 9th of the month has become something of a harbinger of major events. On March 9, we voted 15&shy;-2 in an NLRB election for federal recognition of our existing union. On April 9, our contract was signed. On May 9, we held a March on the Boss regarding holiday pay that coincided with the New Orleans office filing for an NLRB election. June 9, the day after our sit-&shy;in, proved equally momentous as it turned out to be the first day of our lockout.</p>
<p>We had been preparing for a lockout for the better part of a month. While its immediate arrival was somewhat of a&nbsp;surprise, we were more than prepared to meet it head on. The very first day we received calls from corporate stating that the Seattle office was suspended, but we showed we were more than capable of working even without an open office. This act struck existential fear into management, who now knew we could do our jobs without them. We also had a solid legal case against them, thanks to their admission that the lockout was retaliation for the June 8 action.</p>
<p>Typical companies might obscure retaliatory actions behind a thin smoke screen. GCI, though, has been so blatant and consistent with its lawbreaking that even the NLRB can&rsquo;t help but find sympathy with our arguments.</p>
<p>We continued rolling out a campaign of direct action and workplace self-&shy;organization. On June 14th, we launched a phone zap against the corporate office with the aim of getting hundreds, if not thousands, to call GCI&rsquo;s headquarters and demand they end the lockout. Coinciding with this, we began running our own autonomous canvass in the streets of Seattle designed to build support for the union and get people to join in on the phone zap. This powerful collective action gave us a profound sense of what it means to work for ourselves on our own terms and in control of our own labor.</p>
<p>Picketing started that same day. On Thursday and Friday we held spirited informational pickets outside our locked office in Fremont. We drew attention around the neighborhood and the community. Our numbers swelled from 30 attendees the first day to over 50 on the second. Simultaneously, we received solidarity from around the country with pickets at GCI offices in Denver, Raleigh-Durham, Philadelphia, and at the HQ in Boston. Taking to the streets was both a means of catharsis and community building and, when placed in a national context, had the potential to put serious pressure on GCI&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>We continued to organize over the next few days. We fleshed out our plans for a direct action escalation campaign. Fortunately, those plans became unnecessary on Wednesday, June 20, when almost everyone in the office received a new set of phone calls from corporate: the office would reopen on Thursday. The lockout was over. We had won.</p>

<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Group1.jpg" width="320" height="213" align="right" alt="" />We&rsquo;ve received an incredible outpouring of solidarity during and since the end of out lockout. While we may be able to win back the lost two weeks of wages through court battles down the line, many of our workers may have trouble making rent and paying other vital bills this month with the short paychecks. Any support you can give will go a long way towards helping those folks out and making sure we can stand strong as we continue our campaign.</em></p>

<h3>Statement from IU650</h3>
<p>We are not the first canvassing shop to threaten to Unionize. We aren&rsquo;t even the first canvassing shop to follow up on that threat with an NLRB election.</p>
<p>But in a canvassing shop when you go down that path you always hear the same threat. The Bosses will close down your shop. Thats illegal, so they whisper it, they tell it through innuendo, they imply it with stories about other offices that tried.</p>
<p>On June 11th IU 650 Seattle was informed that operations were suspended at the office. We were locked out in response to legally protected concerted action and they were, you know, basically closing the shop.</p>
<p>We launched into action. We took legal recourse. We reached out to our friends and supporters asking them to help with our call in campaign. We reminded Grassroots Campaigns that we work in the street. You can&rsquo;t lock us out of the street. We organize for a living, they cannot expect us not to organize.</p>
<p>We picketed. Wobblies in multiple cities, from Seattle to Boston took direct action on picket lines. Our IU 650 friends in the Deep South stood up for us.</p>
<p>And people called. Eventually they heard us.</p>
<p>The Seattle office of Grassroots Campaigns reopened its doors on June 21st and the members of IU 650 have returned to work. The terms are still under negotiation, many workers have been forced to change campaigns and it has of course provided cover for yet another round of unilateral changes.</p>
<p>But that office is open.</p>
<p>If you are a canvasser. If you organize folks for a living and your boss tells you that you will be punished for organizing with your coworkers. If they subtly imply that canvassing shops get closed down for organizing.</p>
<p>Seattle says they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all of your help.</p>

<p>This fake press release is clearly meant to confuse people into unknowingly working against the rights of the striking workers by fundraising for or giving money to Sisters' Camelot while the fundraisers are still on strike. This statement is meant to help clarify this confusion created by such dishonesty.</p>
