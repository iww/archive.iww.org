</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 05/25/2017 - 7:05pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Portland IWW - <a href="http://portlandiww.org/2017/05/portland-may-day-2017-official-response/" target="_blank">Portland IWW</a>, May 4, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/xPortland-LOGO.png.pagespeed.ic.eyvHj59-oJ/" align="right" alt="" />This was originally sent to KOIN 6 as a response to the events that took place on May Day in Portland.</em></p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World is proud that we were able to celebrate International Workers Day and march in solidarity with so many organizations which are essential and vibrant to the community of Portland and at large. International Workers Day is an important holiday that showcases the struggle of all workers against the wholesale societal systemic oppression brought about by corporations, CEOs, and the mega-rich capitalist class. The fact that there was such a strong contingent of marchers from all walks of life is representative of the American working class.</p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s use of violence against workers and their families &ndash; as well as the children who were in the crowd celebrating the holiday with their parents &ndash; is a travesty and a violation of both human rights, as well as the right to peaceful assembly. We condemn their efforts in restricting accessibility to fellow workers with disabilities, and their blatant disregard for the health and well-being of the people they have sworn to protect. By direct contrast, they assisted visible white supremacists and white nationalists at the &ldquo;March for Free Speech 82nd Ave,&rdquo; specifically a non-permitted march by pro-Trump supporters on April 29th by chartering Tri-Met buses and public transportation to get these people, some of whom were making Nazi salutes during their protest, back to their vehicles.</p>
<p>Our goal is and has always been to support and assist the workers of the world, and we will continue to fight for the needs of all in the face of police and capitalist oppression, and stand by our watchword that an injury to one is an injury to all. As such, the Portland Police Bureau inflicted shameful injury against the workers, their families, and their children during the May Day march; we will stand against that in solidarity with our fellow workers.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 05/08/2017 - 8:30pm</p>
<p><strong>By Patrick O&rsquo;Donoghue - <a target="_blank" href="https://tcorganizer.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/one-class-one-struggle-undocumented-and-citizen-workers-unite-on-may-day/"><em>The Organizer</em></a>, May 1, 2017</strong></p>
<h3><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWMayDay.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="240" alt="" />A Day of Resistance!</h3>
<p>Today is May Day, or as we in the labor movement call it, International Worker&rsquo;s Day- a day of celebration and resistance for working class people. It is a day not only of looking forward to the future, but also remembering the lessons of the past. May Day commemorates&nbsp;the struggle&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Haymarket Martyrs, a group of labor organizers, most of them immigrants, executed in Chicago for their work in the Eight Hour Day movement. The Eight Hour Day was the first time that workers around the world joined together in one campaign, supporting each other&rsquo;s strikes and protests around a&nbsp;single demand- reduce the work day to eight hours, without a cut in pay. The movement faced violence and arrests from governments, but eventually won in country after country. The eight hour day became the basic work day for workers across the countries where the movement fought, with victories across Europe, North and South America, Australia, Iran, Japan, and elsewhere. Over a century ago, workers realized the power we have when we refuse to be divided by borders, industry, or race.</p>
<p>This May Day is also the Day Without Immigrants. It is the latest in a wave of of day strike&nbsp;by immigrant workers- not only to protest&nbsp;wages and work conditions, but also to protest the Trump&rsquo;s plans to increase deportations.&nbsp;Under the Trump&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/politics/immigration-arrests-rise/">ramping up</a> of the Obama administration&rsquo;s already record-breaking deportations, ICE has increasingly targeted previously protected DREAMers and other undocumented people&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration-arrests-of-noncriminals-double-under-trump/2017/04/16/98a2f1e2-2096-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html?utm_term=.e7dd9246fd5a">not otherwise criminalized</a> by the state. ICE raids are becoming&nbsp;more regular even in &ldquo;Sanctuary Cities&rdquo;, and more of our neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends are being&nbsp;captured, torn from their homes, forced through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/us-deaths-immigration-detention">over-crowded detention centers</a> and&nbsp;courts <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/deportation-and-due-process">without due process</a>.</p>
<p>In the Twin Cities, many&nbsp;of the actions today are organized&nbsp;by CTUL, the <a target="_blank" href="http://ctul.net/">workers center for low wage workers of color</a>, especially immigrant workers. Even more of the walk outs and sick outs are &ldquo;wildcat&rdquo; actions organized on the shop floor between undocumented workers, without needing the go-ahead from a union or organizer.</p>
<p>By striking, these undocumented workers are showing how important they are to making the world run. How many restaurants are shut down today because the back end staff didn&rsquo;t come in? How many landscapers and construction companies who rely on day laborerers are not making money today? How many farm fields aren&rsquo;t being worked? Every day, undocumented immigrant workers do some of the toughest jobs in America, and the country starts to grind to a halt without immigrant workers.&nbsp;Deportations crackdowns have already left <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-06/crops-rot-while-trump-led-immigration-backlash-idles-farm-lobby">millions of dollars of produce</a> to rot in the fields in Alabama, Georgia, and California as farmers dependent on exploiting undocumented&nbsp;workers can&rsquo;t find Americans to work for as low as <a target="_blank" href="http://nfwm.org/education-center/farm-worker-issues/low-wages/">$10,000-$12,000 a&nbsp;</a><u>year.</u>&nbsp;The four industries with the most undocumented workforce- agriculture, cleaning and maintenance, construction, and food preparation and service- are all expecting labor shortages if Trump&rsquo;s deportation plan is carried out. American companies and bosses need our immigrant fellow workers- but the administration and parts of the press try to tell workers who are citizens that undocumented workers are hurting American working standards. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p><b><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWdrawing.smlr.preview.gif" alt="" />Whereas</b> increasing numbers of working class and dispossessed people in the United States have begun to meet face to face to proclaim their opposition to economic injustice and define their interests in democratic popular assemblies, autonomous from political parties, as part of the Occupy Movement, which resonates deeply with the IWW's traditions and principles, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> millions of working class and dispossessed people around the world, but especially in Northern Africa and Western Asia, have been organizing themselves to overthrow the governments that enforce the capitalist and neocolonial domination and exploitation they have resisted for generations, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> the IWW has stood since its founding in 1905 for the proposition that:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.<br />
<br />
Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.&quot; and</blockquote>
<p><b>Whereas</b> since 2006 the tradition of the movement for the rights of migrant workers in the U.S. has been to mobilize themselves and their allies for mass actions on May 1 to disrupt the functioning of the economic system and political discourse of the 1%, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> every year May Day is celebrated globally as International Workers Day to commemorate the struggle of the international working class to emancipate itself through the class war over the centuries, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> May Day 1890 was proclaimed to be an international day of working class protest by the Second International against the repression of the 8 Hour Day movement in the U.S. where 8 mostly immigrant anarchist labor organizers were arrested, with 4 being hanged and one committing suicide the night before the hangings, after an unknown person threw a bomb at police who were repressing a protest against police brutality in Haymarket Square in Chicago, and</p>
<p><b>Whereas</b> the Los Angeles branch of the IWW welcomes this opportunity to organize alongside OccupyLA and other participants in the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition to help the working class build the skills, the community, and the combativeness necessary to defend ourselves, our elders, and the generations to come from the global threats of austerity, exploitation, imperialism and ecocide.</p>
<p><b>Be it resolved that</b> the LA Branch of the IWW endorses the May 1, 2012 General Strike and commits to work as part of the Los Angeles General Strike Coalition by conducting trainings and participating in actions in the lead up to May 1.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 04/27/2011 - 12:21am</p>
<div class="content_authors" style=""><a target="_blank" href="http://www.zcommunications.org/what-kind-of-may-day-do-we-need-this-year-by-daniel-gross">By Daniel Gross -&nbsp; Znet, Tuesday, April 19, 2011</a></div>
<p>Who would have thought?<br />
<br />
The self-sacrifice of a street vendor in Tunisia sparked the rage of a nation including general strikes from independent unions which successfully ousted the Ben-Ali dictatorship.&nbsp; The garment workers of Mahalla and their national day of action catalyzed the seeds of revolt in Egypt.&nbsp; Then with millions in the street and Hosni Mubarak obstinately ensconced in his compound, mass industrial action from workers across sectors and across Egypt broke the stalemate and ended a 30-year reign of oppression.&nbsp; Popular revolts have spread throughout the region.<br />
<br />
When Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker launched extremist attacks on public worker union rights for the benefit of corporate elites, the example of the Egyptian and Tunisian achievements inspired workers to actions with a scope and spirit unseen for decades in the U.S. labor movement.&nbsp; The persistent occupation of the Capitol and enthusiastic solidarity from far and wide proved that the sense of self-worth and fighting spirit of the American worker is alive and well.&nbsp; A General Strike is being discussed by workers in states around the country, not as a historical relic, but as a practical, effective, and needed tool to deal with problems at work and in the political system.<br />
<br />
As the attacks on public and private sector unions escalate, the racist scapegoating, exploitation, and deportation of immigrant workers continues apace.&nbsp; Right-wing legislators in states across the country are pursuing the Arizona show-me-your-papers racial profiling model which undermines the liberty and offends the dignity of every working person.&nbsp; Employers enrich themselves for years on the hard work of immigrant employees only to cynically raise status issues when confronted with demands for stolen wages or for decent working conditions.&nbsp; Yet still, immigrant workers of color are routinely demonstrating the courage to lead some of the most profound and hard-fought labor campaigns in the United States.<br />
<br />
On May 1, 2006, millions of immigrant workers and their allies poured into the streets from coast to coast with tremendous spirit and energy to give May Day life again after decades of slumber in the country in which it was born.&nbsp; Regrettably, many corners of the labor movement shied away from this watershed moment which featured large numbers of workers actually striking their jobs without even the protection of union membership.&nbsp; The achievement of International Workers Day in 2006 has yet to be duplicated.<br />
<br />
The combination of existential challenges and historic opportunities facing workers indicates only one appropriate response on May 1, 2011: everyone together in the streets against the attacks on immigrants, public and private sector unions, and all working people.&nbsp; A new network of over fifty leading worker and community-based organizations, May Day United, has been hard at work building just this type of dynamic May 1st under the banner of &quot;A Day Without Workers&quot; and a call for, &quot;No Work, No Shopping, and No School-Related Activities.&quot;&nbsp; May 1st falls on a Sunday this year which should help facilitate the participation of many working families.<br />
