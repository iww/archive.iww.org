But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay a sacrifice to make things better for our people. The sacrifice I have made, when I really sit down to think about it, is nothing compared to what our people of 100 years ago, or 50 years ago or 25 years ago made. Some gave their lives. Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms. So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those. I have gone too far now to start backing down. I don&rsquo;t give up, not until my people are free will I give up.

He called back later that day saying that they &ldquo;were demanding a compulsory interview, and that should I refuse to schedule one or fail to show up, they would come and pick me up.&rdquo; We scheduled the appointment for the following day. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_541 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/atlanta-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Atlanta GMB">Atlanta GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_406 last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="General Defense Committee" class="active">General Defense Committee</a></li></ul> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../../../../node/1972/" title="Read the rest of This is what FBI harassment looks like.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 01/10/2006 - 1:51am</p>
<p><strong>December 22nd:</strong> Last Thursday at 7 in the morning, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents with guns busted into the San Francisco apartment of two Young Workers United (YWU) members. The couple was excitedly preparing for the birth of their first child. It appears to be the case that the womans former employers called the ICE on this young family. Due to legal considerations, YWU is not releasing the name the couple or the restaurant. Her employer had been paying far below the legal minimum wage, and also yelled at workers, threatened them with deportation, called them racial slurs and ultimately fired the young woman for speaking out and organizing against these abuses and being pregnant. <br /><br /> The young man was taken away and flown that night to a detention center in Eloy, Arizona. It is virtually impossible to get into the detention center and 90% of the detainees have no access to a lawyer. YWU is working tirelessly to coordinate with lawyers and Arizona immigrant rights group to get the all the resources he needs. A recent doctor's appointment indicates that the young woman will likely give birth this week. YWU has helped win a minimum wage charge through the City and has claims for pregnancy discrimination and retaliation. This young mother-to-be has no income since the ICE is detaining her partner. Young Workers United is asking for donations to be sent to help with her expenses.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <em>Update:&nbsp; The father is still in custody in Eli, Nevada.&nbsp; He has a lawyer and support from Young Workers United and the local labor and immigrants' rights communities.&nbsp; An attempt to post bail at his hearing on January 3rd was ignored by the judge.<br /> </em> </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
