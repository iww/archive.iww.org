</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/13/2016 - 5:06pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://m1aa.org/?p=1316">First of May Anarchist Alliance</a>, December 4, 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/TC_GDC_Defend.preview.jpg" alt="" align="right" />A PDF of this interview is <a href="http://m1aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GDC-Interview.pdf"><em>here</em></a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>The General Defense Committee of the Industrial Workers World (IWW) has become an important pole of struggle for pro-working-class revolutionaries in the Twin Cities. While active on a number of different fronts it is the participation of the General Defense Committee (GDC) in the year-long struggle against police killings and brutality in the Twin Cities that has largely led to the significant growth of the organization. The GDC has grown to approximately 90 dues-paying members in Minnesota, and has several active working-groups. In the wake of Trump&rsquo;s election victory, Wobblies<sup>(1)</sup></em> <em>and others across the country have begun establishing their own GDC locals &ndash; strongly influenced by the Twin Cities&rsquo; model.</em></p>
<p>Interview:</p>
<p><strong>First of May Anarchist Alliance</strong> spoke to Erik D. secretary of the Twin Cities GDC Local 14 about the history and work of the General Defense Committee there. Erik is a father, husband, education worker, and wobbly, who&rsquo;s also been involved in the youth-focused intergenerational group, the Junior Wobblies.</p>
<p><strong>Fellow Worker Erik &ndash; can you tell us about the origins and history of the General Defense Committee, its relationship to the IWW and how the militants who founded the current Local conceived of it?</strong></p>
<p>As I understand it, the General Defense Committee (GDC) was first founded by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1917, in response to the repression of wobblies and anti-WWI draft protests. I haven&rsquo;t learned enough about the historic GDC to really speak much about it. I joined the IWW in 2006, and we didn&rsquo;t formally charter the current local as a GDC until 2011. In 2011, the committee was 13 wobblies. But we had actually started organizing ourselves prior to 2011, calling ourselves the Local Defense Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Are there historical or modern examples or inspirations that influence the way GDC sees itself, its activity and organization?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve appreciated about the Twin Cities GDC is the very practical intention to learn, with a specific focus on learning in order to act. From the very beginning we engaged in mutual education. Since one of our early orientations was to anti-fascist and anti-racist work, we did a fair bit of reading on the topic of fascism and anti-fascism (Sunday mornings with coffee).</p>
<p>I mention this period of mutual education because we have a lot of inspirations, but none of them have been role models, per se. We have looked to previous movements largely in order to inform our own work and to learn from our elders and the experience of previous generations, but not as Role Models To Be Emulated. That&rsquo;s been important.</p>
<p>With that caveat, we have a lot of inspiration. I get new inspiration every time I read a book, it seems. Some of the inspiration is local: here, I&rsquo;d specifically highlight Anti-Racist Action and Teamsters Local 544. Anti-Racist Action (ARA) came out of a Minneapolis-based group of anti-racist skinheads who decided they needed to find a way to kick racist skins and organized fascists out of the Twin Cities. Teamsters Local 544 was the local that organized the 1934 strike that made Minneapolis a union town, innovated new forms of the picket (specifically, the &lsquo;flying picket&rsquo;), and engaged for a short time in open physical confrontation on the streets.</p>
<p>Beyond the Twin Cities, I think our members have a lot of very different inspirations. One of mine has always been John Brown, but I grew up partly in Kansas. I guess the Black Panther Party would be the most common source of inspiration among early members; our advocacy of Community Self Defense certainly owes a lot to the Panthers, including their Survival Programs. The most recent addition to my &lsquo;Hall of Inspiration&rsquo; is Rudy Shields, whom I learned about from Akinyele Omowale Umoja&rsquo;s <em>We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement.</em></p>
<p><strong>One of the first projects of the Twin Cities GDC was organizing a &ldquo;Picket Training&rdquo;, which seems like a kind of simple project, but you all attached some importance to it. How come?</strong></p>
<p>I think the history of the Picket Training is actually the beginning of the history of the local GDC, so forgive me for a longer answer. The IWW was always heavily involved in local May Day events, naturally. In both 2007 and 2008 we had dispiriting and potentially dangerous experiences in marches that were organized by other groups. These happened when we were &lsquo;out-marshaled&rsquo; and &lsquo;peace-policed.&rsquo; Folks might remember the 2006 &ldquo;Day Without An Immigrant.&rdquo; In 2007 immigrant protection and rights continued to be major issues, and the march was partly centered around pro-immigrant demands.</p>
<p>So it was worrying when wobblies who had been active in local anti-fascist actions saw someone they thought they knew from a fascist rally elsewhere in the state videotaping the crowd (we were never able to confirm the identity because of what happened next). Fascists videotaping an immigrants rights march is extremely concerning; they were likely videotaping either to research immigrants rights&rsquo; groups (including antifa groups), or to identify potentially undocumented people.</p>
<p>A few wobblies went to talk to the videotaper and get in the way of the camera. Shouting commenced, and the self-appointed organizers of the march successfully pushed the wobblies back into the crowd, allowing the videotaping to continue.</p>
<p>The May Day parade the next year found wobblies promoting militant chants shut down by the same sort of marshals.</p>
<p>At roughly the same time, the local IWW was doing a lot of organizing. While some of us had prior experience in organizing pickets and direct actions, the Starbucks Workers campaign, the Jimmy John&rsquo;s campaign, the Sisters Camelot Canvas Union, and the Chicago-Lake Liquors campaigns all provided early experience and training in planning and executing pickets and direct actions, in a context where we were already committed to IWW ideas and practices. Some of these were particularly challenging, such as doing intelligence and the occasional flying picket of scab canvassers in the Sisters Camelot campaign. Since they never stayed put, it felt like a throwback to the 1934 strikes and the flying pickets. It was cold both Winters.</p>
<p>There was one particular occasion at the University of Minnesota AFSCME strike in 2007 where the IWW promoted, and executed, a hard picket line in the early morning hours at a delivery dock. This was going extremely well until a UMN delivery truck driver rammed the picket line. I was in the wrong place at the moment, and ended up on his hood. I found out later I&rsquo;d crushed three neck vertebrae; it took two surgeries and a lot of physical therapy to get past it. It also gave me a serious motivation for doing pickets and direct actions better. Just a week after a truck hit me, a delivery truck hit another picketer at an IWW picket of D&rsquo;Amico&rsquo;s restaurant, thankfully without serious consequences.</p>
<p>Finally, 2008 was the end of an intense two-year process organized at disrupting the Republican National Convention. Most of us already had a critique of &lsquo;summit hopping&rsquo; styles of disruption, few of which have been effective since before the FTAA in Miami 2003. But a number of wobblies were serious and on occasion influential participants in (at least the early period of) the two years of planning that ended up calling itself the &ldquo;Welcoming Committee.&rdquo; The Welcoming Committee meetings (which were held in the same community space as the early IWW at the time, the Jack Pine Community Center) hammered out some early agreements and principles, including, along with other interested groups, the well-known Saint Paul Principles. This process also gave local wobblies experience in critically thinking through on-the-street tactics and what it would take to actually win goals and actions on those streets, whether in labor pickets or direct actions<sup>(2)</sup>.<sup><br />
</sup></p>
<p>All these motivations and experiences were in the forefront of our minds when we thought up the picket training. We knew we had to get better at this, and though we all had some experience, that&rsquo;s not the same thing as having teachable knowledge. So we researched, wrote, debated, and practiced. We adopted a principle of teaching the tactics quickly rather than perfecting the training first, and encouraged people to think about themselves as the next trainers. In order to keep track of our curriculum and to make it portable, we created a trainer&rsquo;s manual, a trainee manual, and a setup manual, which we update frequently.</p>
<p>We offer the trainings to non-wobblies, and while we avoid being an on-call security group, we are trusted locally as providing quality security and planning successful actions. With the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and on-the-streets protest since Ferguson, I think the GDC has earned a bit of respect from other local organizations as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Statement on Opposing All Oppression from the <a href="https://twincitiesgdc.org/antifascism/" target="_blank">Twin Cities GDC Local 14</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Didnottread.jpg" width="400" height="225" align="right" alt="" />1. ANY SUCCESSFUL WORKER REVOLUTION WILL REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM DIVERSE MEMBERS OF THE WORKING CLASS, CURRENTLY DIVIDED BY MANY OPPRESSIONS.</strong></p>
<p>We fight against capitalism. We do so because capitalism is organized theft based on hierarchy. We unionize because fighting this authoritarian theft can be done most successfully in the workplace, at the point of production. In unionizing we face many challenges, from creating strategies and tactics to accomplish our goals, as well as maintaining morale, fighting spirit, and solidarity with each other.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult challenges the working class faces is that of oppressive social divisions. We may be of a single class, but we are not the same as a result. In addition to experiencing the oppressions of our class, we have differing experiences of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism and Islamphobia, along with other types of oppressions. Some of us experience privilege on the basis of our race, sex, gender, or religion, while others among us experience oppression on precisely the same grounds.</p>
<p>The ruling classes know this, of course. It is one of their favorite strategies for destroying organized workers: divide and conquer. Many of these oppressions exist in starkest relief in America&rsquo;s massive prison-industrial system, where wardens encourage and enforce racial segregation and violence among prisoners, precisely as a system of maintaining control. These forms of control through oppression are not limited to prisons, of course. We see and experience them in our daily lives, and in our workplaces as well.</p>
<p>To maintain solidarity with all workers requires that we maintain explicit solidarity with workers on the diverse grounds of their oppression. Our revolution cannot maintain a merely minimal, workerist, program which concentrates on the oppression of labor and leaves other problems solely to those workers who face them. Given the still relatively homogenous makeup of the Industrial Workers of the World, to do so sends a clear message to the working class experiencing such oppressions that the class struggle and their struggles against racism, gendered, or religious oppression are separate issues. If you were already struggling to keep the basics of your life together in the face of constant attacks on your person, would you be interested in taking on another massive but unconnected struggle in your workplace? By pointing out the ways in which struggles against all oppression support and further our collective freedom from class and other oppressions, we gain strength as a union.</p>
<p>Neither have we proceeded, historically, with a minimal program of workplace organization that leaves other oppressions unchallenged. The Industrial Workers of the World were founded in 1905 in part precisely to overcome the divisions of race, sex, religion, language, nationality, etc., among the working class. Militantly in favor of the organization of the entire working class, Wobblies quickly turned toward the power of young women in garment factories, racially-mixed work-gangs on the waterfronts, and nationally diverse immigrant groups. The IWW took on the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations that attempted to divide the class on the grounds of race. More recently, some IWW branches have begun to successfully undermine the divisions of oppressions based on gendered identities in ways that seem truly revolutionary.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 11/30/2015 - 9:03pm</p>
<p><i><b>We prepared this short piece after several comrades were&nbsp;badjacketed&nbsp;in public and with pictures on social media at the 4th Precinct Shutdown.</b>&nbsp;We believe those individual cases have been dealt with, and don&rsquo;t wish to cause unnecessary division by complaining, or publicly calling any group or individual out. Instead,&nbsp;<b>this is intended to provoke reflection</b>, and conversation, amongst all of us, as to how to deal with the suspicions we may have of people we don&rsquo;t know in our growing movements, without creating the sorts of divisions among ourselves that does the work of the State and the police for them. We intend to act in solidarity with those who know how to act in solidarity.</i><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><i>We ask that all organizations and groups working for a better world in which we have killed White Supremacy, Capitalism, and all other forms of oppression, consider that (1) none of us represent the mandate of all the people, (2) that we may have instead genuine and important strategic and tactical differences between ourselves about the best ways to accomplish that world, (3) that&nbsp;<b>we will not win by pretending these differences do not exist, or dictating against difference, but instead by engaging on these differences in the most democratic and least hierarchical ways&nbsp;possible.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Therefore, we ask that groups and individuals read this document against the practice ofbadjacketing, discuss it, and consider publicly endorsing here that we will refrain from the practices of&nbsp;badjacketing.</b>&nbsp;This is not a call to be lax about security; indeed, many of us have been very involved in the provision of security at the Fourth Precinct. Instead, it is a call to be democratic and accountable about our security practices.&nbsp;<b>Please indicate your endorsement in the comments below.</b></i></p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-26 at 2.52.04 PM" src="https://twincitiesgdcdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-26-at-2-52-04-pm.jpeg?w=660" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party, and Anna Mae Aquash of AIM.</em></p>
<p>Every time people organize for liberation, autonomy, and a better world, the state and the bosses try to crush our movements. They don&rsquo;t particularly care how they do it, but they don&rsquo;t want to work hard. It&rsquo;s easier for them, if we do it for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can do this by misportraying us in the media, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sowing distrust and division within or between movements, and they do.</li>
<li>They can do this by harassing our people and preventing them from getting jobs, or demoralizing them with constant police contact, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sending infiltrators into our groups, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by encouraging fascist groups to attack us, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by directly and openly attacking us with police, and they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps the easiest and most effective thing they can do to neutralize and destroy our movements for liberation is to encourage us to act paranoid and to refuse each other&rsquo;s solidarity. One of the most effective techniques for this is called&nbsp;<b><span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;</b>(aka &lsquo;snitchjacketing,&rsquo; &lsquo;badjacketing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad-rapping&rsquo;), and it&rsquo;s when one of our own (or a paid infiltrator) accuses others without cause or evidence of being a infiltrator, threat, or security risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>BADJACKETING:&nbsp;</b>creating suspicion, by spreading rumors or unsubstantiated accusations, that people are undercovers, infiltrators, snitches, or cooperators. Sometimes this is done out of fear and paranoia. But normally, those who &lsquo;lay jackets&rsquo; on others want to consolidate their control over a movement and feel threatened in their authority. It&rsquo;s a favorite tactic of the State in destroying movements of liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tactics of the state and the police go together, and&nbsp;<span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;often leads to direct violence and the destruction of movements. If you&rsquo;re still reading, let&rsquo;s take a look at two well known regional cases: the State assassination of Illinois Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark Clark (1969), and the murder of American Indian Movement militant and Anna Mae Aquash (Mi&rsquo;kmaq) (1975).</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 04/02/2012 - 4:25pm</p>
<p>Note: <i>Judi Bari was a dues paying member of the IWW from 1988-94 and active in the IWW when the bombing on May 24, 1990 took place.</i></p>
<p><b>By Ben Rosenfeld - April 2, 2012</b></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/judi1.jpg" alt="" />In an order dated March 31, 2012 and released today, Honorable Claudia Wilken, United States District Judge of the Northern District of California, affirmed a March 21, 2011 Order by Magistrate Judge James Larson, directing the United States, through the FBI, to turn over evidence in the 1990 car bomb assassination attempt of Judi Bari in Oakland, CA to a third party forensic laboratory for independent testing.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a historic and momentous development&quot;, said Ben Rosenfeld, attorney for plaintiff Darryl Cherney, Judi Bari's co-organizer in the sustained campaign to preserve California's ancient redwoods, who was also injured when the bomb went off. Cherney went to Court in 2010 to prevent the FBI from destroying the evidence. That evidence includes a mostly intact explosive device built by the same hands as the car bomb, a cardboard sign, and latent fingerprints.</p>
<p>The FBI never subjected this evidence to basic forensic examination. Its lawyers contacted Cherney's lawyers in 2010 announcing plans to destroy the evidence. In 2002, an Oakland federal jury found three FBI agents and three Oakland police officers liable for violating Bari and Cherney's First and Fourth Amendment Rights in trying to frame them by falsely accusing them of transporting the bomb which nearly killed them. The FBI never looked elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cherney alone has continued to pursue the bomber(s). With co-Director Mary Liz Thomson, he just released a new documentary entitled <a whobombedjudibari.com="" http:="" target="_blank">Who Bombed Judi Bari?</a> The evidence, hitherto sealed away in an FBI locker, may finally yield an answer to that question.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/28/2011 - 1:28pm</p>
<p><img width="150" height="154" align="right" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/CatLogo2.jpg" alt="" />On behalf of our union, the General Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the World sends our support and solidarity to the occupation of Wall Street, those determined to hold accountable our oppressors. </p>
<p>This occupation on Wall Street calls into question the very foundation in which the capitalist system is based, and its relentless desire to place profit over and above all else. </p>
<p>When 1% of the ruling class holds the wealth created by the other 99%, it is clear that the watchwords found in our union's preamble, &quot;the working class and the employing class have nothing in common&quot;, ring true more than ever.?The IWW does not follow a business union model. We believe that the working class and the employing class have nothing in common and we don't foster illusions to the contrary. </p>
<p>Throughout the world, from Egypt to Greece, from China to Madison, Wisconsin, working class people are starting to rise up. The IWW welcomes this. We see the occupation of Wall Street as another step - no matter how large or small - in this process.</p>
