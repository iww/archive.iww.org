<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 07/25/2017 - 7:22pm</p>
<p><strong>By the members of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midatlanticgdc.com/j20_defense_campaign_goes_global?recruiter_id=563">Mid Atlantic General Defense Committee</a></strong><strong>, July 20, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em>This past week, <strong><a target="_blank" title="J20 Letter" href="http://www.midatlanticgdc.com/letter">our J20 campaign</a></strong> not only received endorsements from more unions and organizations across the country, but from multiple European unions as well.&nbsp; As we approach the J20 Week of Solidarity July 20-27 organized by <strong><a target="_blank" title="Defend J20 Resistance" href="http://defendj20resistance.org/">Defend J20 Resistance</a></strong>, we're happy to have this boost of energy and support!</em></p>
<h3><strong>Endorsement Update </strong></h3>
<p>This past week or so, we received endorsements from multiple IWW branches such as those in <strong><a target="_blank" title="Baltimore IWW" href="https://www.facebook.com/IWW-Baltimore-97451807925/">Baltimore, Maryland</a> </strong>and <strong><a target="_blank" title="Tampa Bay IWW" href="https://www.facebook.com/IWWTampa/">Tampa, Florida</a></strong>.&nbsp; In addition, we received endorsements from the <strong><a target="_blank" title="Metro DC Socialist Party" href="https://www.facebook.com/MetroDCSP/">Washington, D.C. branch of the Socialist Party, USA</a></strong>, and the <strong><a target="_blank" title="SeaSol" href="http://www.seasol.net/">Seattle Solidarity Network</a></strong>, commonly known as SeaSol.&nbsp; SeaSol has long been an inspiration for many of us in forming the GDC, so we wanted to give a particular shout out to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/midatlanticgdc/pages/24/attachments/original/1500389082/shuler-picket1.jpg?1500389082" alt="shuler-picket1.jpg" width="410" height="230" /></p>
<p>If you haven't encountered SeaSol before, you should do yourself a favor and <strong><a target="_blank" title="SeaSol" href="http://www.seasol.net/">check them out</a></strong>--they're a &quot;volunteer network of working people who defend each other through collective action,&quot; who have amassed an impressive list of victories fighting for tenants' and workers' rights in Seattle over the past decade.&nbsp; Their amazing successes have led to similar groups elsewhere, and has shown a working, democratic model of how working people can take action to fight against abusive bosses and landlords.&nbsp; We're really thrilled that they've endorsed our letter!</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 06/28/2017 - 7:38pm</p>
<p><strong>By Mid Atlantic General Defense Committee - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/letter-j20-defense-campaign-mid-atlantic-gdc/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, June 27, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/gdc-banner-freezing.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="180" align="right" />PDF Version </em><strong><a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/midatlanticgdc/pages/18/attachments/original/1498512767/J20DefenseLetter.pdf?1498512767" target="_blank">Here</a></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Looking for a solidarity statement&nbsp;that you can take to your union, local organization, or faith based group to sign and build a base of support for J20 arrestees facing repression? The Mid-Atlantic General Defense Committee of the IWW has created one along with a<a href="http://www.midatlanticgdc.com/petition" target="_blank">&nbsp;petition for individuals to sign here.</a></strong></h5>
<p>On January 20, 2017, thousands took to the streets of Washington, D.C., to protest the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. During one of the many marches held on Inauguration Day, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department showed the world how it planned to treat dissent moving forward: Shortly after the protest began, hundreds of protesters were attacked with pepper spray, rubber bullets, and batons. Police confined over 200 people within a &ldquo;kettle&rdquo; for hours before arresting them. Every protester&rsquo;s cell phone was confiscated as evidence and rooted through. Upon being released, they were handed a riot charge. Months later, US attorneys piled on 8 additional felony charges, including &ldquo;Conspiracy to Riot&rdquo;. Protesters now face up to 75 years in prison &ndash; all for attending a demonstration.</p>
<p>Among the people arrested were over two dozen members of our union, the Industrial Workers of the World, and its affiliated legal defense and community organizing body, the IWW General Defense Committee (GDC). Within the IWW and GDC, we don&rsquo;t shy away from our members&rsquo; politics, and support our members&rsquo; rights to express their politics through protests and marches, a tradition that goes back within our union to battles over free speech in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Since the arrests, D.C. prosecutors and police have shown a disturbing pattern of repression as well as specific targeting of IWW and GDC members. Our members had their union cards and buttons confiscated and held as evidence. Months after the protest, three individuals (including two prominent members of the DC IWW local branch) were served with warrants for their arrest on charges of conspiracy to riot. Prior to their warrants being issued, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office revealed that they had created separate trial groupings, including one grouping where nearly all defendants were IWW or GDC members. While they will not say as much in public, it has become clear that the city attorneys for Washington, D.C. are treating membership in our union as evidence of a criminal act.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the IWW has been targeted for repression, and it is unlikely to be the last. The crackdown on protesters in D.C. is part of a larger effort to criminalize and silence dissent in working-class and marginalized communities. D.C. is just one of more than a dozen states that are attempting to quell dissent through legislation or harsh legal penalties. This is not a coincidence. <strong>People in power want activists and <strong>organizations to be afraid to protest Trump&rsquo;s agenda.</strong></strong></p>
<p>The labor movement cannot succeed if union members are treated as criminals when protesting anti-union and anti-worker politicians and their policies. No social movement can operate in repressive conditions like that. We have always stood by the principle that &ldquo;an injury to one is an injury to all.&rdquo; In this spirit, we are calling on our friends and allies in the labor movement, as well as in allied progressive or left groups, to share this letter and pass the following motion within your union local or organization<strong>:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 06/18/2017 - 4:42pm</p>
<p><strong>By anonymous - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/utica-ny-iww-community-groups-mobilize-halt-deportation/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, June 8, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/j20.preview.jpg" align="right" alt="" />A father, soccer coach, and Utica resident Ricky Morgan was separated from his family on June 5th during a routine check-in with ICE and will now be deported to Jamaica. Family members, community members and local activists are struggling to come to terms with this sudden, grim reality.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, a broad coalition of organizations, including ICE-Free Capital District, the labor union Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Troy Sanctuary Movement and the Unitarian Universalist Society of Saratoga Springs have come to Ricky&rsquo;s aid and accompanied him for monthly check-ins with ICE. Ricky was inspired by a previous rally activists held for a mother and immigrant from Hudson, NY who was facing deportation. He hoped that similar support from the community would help him in the future. For a while, Ricky was only checking in with ICE once a year until he was told after the election of Trump that he became a priority for deportation and had to check in with ICE monthly.</p>
<p>Ricky moved to the US in the 1990s on a work visa and is still permitted to work in the US. He was targeted in the past by ICE during the Obama administration and was separated from his family by ICE for six months while he was kept in Batavia&rsquo;s ICE Detention Center, one of countless jails in the US that exist to house immigrants. He will now be sent back to Batavia before his deportation.</p>
<p>Joe Paparone, an organizer with ICE-Free Capital District stated: &ldquo;We need to start telling the truth. Immigration enforcement has nothing to do with criminality, and it&rsquo;s regular people like Ricky &ndash; people with families, communities, workplaces, neighbors, that are having their lives torn apart, for no reason other than the racist scapegoating of a pathological liar. Those of us who care about our communities are going to keep fighting this racist deportation regime, and keep standing up for vulnerable members of our communities.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/28/2017 - 11:14pm</p>
<p><strong>By anonymous - <a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/sign-statement-solidarity-j20-defendants/"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, April 26, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/j20.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="220" alt="" />The following statement was drafted by supporters of those arrested at Inauguration protests in DC on January 20th, with the intent of providing a public platform for organizations around North America to express their collective opposition to these charges. The list of signees will be posted and continually updated at defendJ20resistance.org and several other sites.

<h2>Statement of Solidarity with #DisruptJ20 Defendants</h2>
<p>On January 20, 2017, tens of thousands of people converged in Washington, D.C. for the #disruptJ20 protests to oppose the inauguration of Donald Trump. A combination of blockades, marches, and festive demonstrations shattered the spectacle of a peaceful transition of power, and made it clear around the world that people do not recognize Trump&rsquo;s authority. What could have been a day signaling resignation and defeat became a moment of defiance and resistance. As such, the protests on J20 set a tone and precedent for the events that unfolded shortly after, including the notably successful, mass direct actions at airports against Trump&rsquo;s Muslim ban, as well as ongoing resistance to deportations. While Trump and his alt-right foot soldiers have encountered few meaningful obstacles from liberal politicians in the halls of power, grassroots resistance has continued to prove a substantial force.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, with resistance comes repression. In addition to shooting pepper spray and concussion grenades indiscriminately at protesters, including children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, DC police cordoned off an entire block and mass arrested more than 230 people in an attempt to stop an anti-capitalist and anti-fascist march. While mass arrests are not unheard of, in this case arrestees are each being charged with felony riot, a charge that potentially carries <em>ten years in prison</em>.</p>
<p>With these heightened charges the state is trying to set a precedent for harsh crackdowns of disruptive protest in the future, so that Trump can proceed with his agenda unimpeded by anything but symbolic hand-wringing. This strategy corresponds with a broader wave of repression and reaction, from the arrests and grand jury investigations of Indigenous water protectors at #StandingRock to backlash against #BlackLivesMatter and black-led uprisings against police. The arrests at J20 also inform local strategies for repression, including anti-protest laws that have been proposed in 18 different state legislatures, which further criminalize commonly used tactics like highway takeovers and in some cases make it legal for drivers to knowingly hit protesters marching in roadways.</p>
<p>The charges against J20 defendants are an experiment. If the courts are able to successfully prosecute those arrested at J20, this will send a green light to the forces of repression seeking to contain, control, and eliminate social movements around the country. Just as all of our struggles are connected, we understand these arrests to represent a real threat to all efforts towards true freedom, dignity, and autonomy. We call for the immediate dropping of all charges, and express our sincere solidarity with and support for those arrested, and encourage others to do so as well.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>

<a href="../../../../content/militant-tactics-anti-fascist-organizing-interview-transcript/" rel="bookmark">Militant Tactics in Anti-Fascist Organizing--Interview Transcript</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 04/28/2017 - 5:23pm</p>
<p><strong>By Matthew N Lyons - <a href="https://threewayfight.blogspot.com/2017/04/militant-tactics-in-anti-fascist.html" target="_blank"><em>Three Way Fight</em></a>, April 26, 2017</strong></p>
<p><i><img src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/Rev-Antifa-Unionism-GDC.jpg" align="right" alt="" />This interview with longtime anti-fascist activist Kieran (who was one of the founders of Three Way Fight thirteen years ago) covers a wide range of topics: from the work of Anti-Racist Action in the 1980s and 90s to the IWW&rsquo;s General Defense Committee today, from the politics of wearing masks to the dangers of relying on the state for protection, and from engaging organized labor to building community-based self-defense against the far right.</i></p>
<p><i> The interview was conducted for KPFA Radio&rsquo;s <a href="https://kpfa.org/program/against-the-grain/" target="_blank">Against the Grain</a> by the program&rsquo;s co-producer Sasha Lilley and was broadcast on February 14, 2017. The audio recording is available for download or online listening <a href="https://kpfa.org/episode/against-the-grain-february-14-2017/" target="_blank">here</a>. The following transcription, by Clarissa Rogers, appears with the permission of Against the Grain and the participants.</i></p>
<p>Kieran was one of the founders of Anti-Racist Action, a youth-based direct action movement that organized against Nazi skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan, and the white power music scene from the 1980s to the 2000s. He&rsquo;s now chief steward in a local union of telecom workers and is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World&rsquo;s General Defense Committee, which has taken on anti-fascist work in a number of cities. In late January, a member of the General Defense Committee of the IWW was shot at a Milo Yiannopoulos event in Seattle. Against the Grain, a program of radical ideas originating from KPFA Radio, spoke with him after demonstrators closed down Yiannapoulous&rsquo; event at UC Berkeley on February 1st.</p>
<p><b>ATG:</b> Kieran, many liberals and leftists believe that the right of free speech is paramount. As you know, protestors using militant tactics shut down a Milo Yiannopoulos event at UC Berkeley, which is the home of the Free Speech Movement. Why don&rsquo;t you think that the right of free speech should be extended to fascists and the far right?</p>
<p><b>Kieran:</b> There are a couple points to this. I think there&rsquo;s both a question of strategy and tactics. I think that all of this is with the understanding that what we&rsquo;re opposing is not the free speech of fascists, or the speeches of fascists. What we&rsquo;re doing is opposing the organizing of the fascists. So, for instance, in my workplace, I work with workers with a whole range of opinions on all different kinds of questions. And occasionally you&rsquo;re going to run into people who are influenced by far right politics. In those circumstances it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for me to start a fight, a physical fight with a coworker since they raised some perspective that comes from that background.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s totally different than a situation where you have an organization or a personality who&rsquo;s using the framework of a public speech or an event, a forum, in order to advance political goals. And so the way we look at it is the way we would look at any kind of organizing done by that group with those aims.</p>
<p>In the case at UC Berkeley, this outright celebrity and provocateur, Milo Yiannopoulos, very clearly is trying to advance a certain kind of politics and more and more is trying to shape it into a movement. Our understanding is that he was planning to out undocumented students at Berkeley for the sole purpose of putting them under attack by Trump&rsquo;s immigration forces. And, so, in that circumstance, we can&rsquo;t let that attack go unchallenged. And I think that when you look at it from that perspective, it makes sense to try and oppose it.</p>
<p>If we just wait until they&rsquo;ve created the groundswell, or created the base of support for these aggressive actions to take place, it can be too late. And so the way we approach fascist organizing or right wing organizing is not really focused on the question of free speech but is focused on whether or not we&rsquo;re going to let them organize to implement their program. And our perspective is that we&rsquo;re not. We&rsquo;re going to challenge it. We&rsquo;re going to try to stop it. We&rsquo;re going to try to stop them.</p>
