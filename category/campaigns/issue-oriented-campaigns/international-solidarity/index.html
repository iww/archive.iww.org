</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 04/04/2019 - 6:11pm</p>
<p class="rteleft">On January 25th, workers in the maquiladora plants in Matamoros, Mexico began a strike to demand a wage increase of 20% and an annual bonus of 32,000 pesos. Since then, the movement has spread to various industries: self-service shops, mining, Coca Cola factories, metal factories, and others. The workers&rsquo; demands are just. We support the movement&rsquo;s demands and express our sympathy and support with the movement in its struggle to improve living conditions.<br />
<br />
Recently, there have been strong confrontations between strikers and scabs at the Coca Cola and Mecalux factories, which unfortunately resulted in 9 injuries. We stand against any type of harassment of repressive end of the conflict, and send our widest support for the situation to be resolved without violence and in favor of the striking workers.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_422 first last active"><a href="." rel="tag" title="International Solidarity" class="active">International Solidarity</a></li></ul> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../../../../content/statements-solidarity-strikes-mexico/" title="Read the rest of Statements of Solidarity for the Strikes in Mexico.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

</h2>
 <p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 02/26/2013 - 9:18pm</p>
<p><img src="https://libcom.org/files/images/news/viome.jpg" width="300" height="170" vspace="5" hspace="10" border="10" align="right" alt="" />The International Solidarity Commission (ISC) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) congratulates the workers of Viomichaniki Metaleftiki (Industrial Mining) for taking control over their factory and restarting production after having occupied it for more than 20 months.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After fighting for the payment of their stolen wages since May 2011, the workers have now decided in a direct-democratic assembly to collectively organize production without bosses. They have brought the factory back into operation, shifting to the production of building materials that are not toxic or damaging for the environment. The IWW International Solidarity Commission is in full support of this move.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As the world plunges deeper into economic and ecological crisis, the workers at Vio.Me have shown us the way forward. Instead of waiting for the state to decrease unemployment, instead of leaving their fate in the hands of the capitalist legal system or state bureaucrats, the workers of Vio.Me decided to take the factory into their own hands and to operate it themselves. The Vio.ME workers have given us all a living example of workers&rsquo; power and have lit the way for all of us in the struggle against capitalism throughout the world. It is now up to all of us to take the next steps in our own workplaces and struggles. Let this be one of millions of workplace takeovers to come across Greece and the world.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The IWW is committed to a grassroots, global resistance to the employing class. We aim to work with others to build a movement that can defeat the capitalists and construct a new world based workers control of the means of production and a radically democratic economy. We salute the seizure of the Vio.Me factory as a step in the right direction, and pledge our solidarity and our commitment to stand at the side of all workers in the struggle for the emancipation of the working class, for the creation of a world without bosses!<br />

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 01/20/2013 - 3:03pm</p>
<p>Workers of Neupack Verpackungen GmbH - a German Manufacturer of wrapping materials - are on strike for better working conditions and a labor agreement. They complain about unequal and generally low wages and an arbitrary and disrespectful management style. Even though they struggle for many weeks now, the company&rsquo;s proprietors show hardly any willingness to make concessions. They have hired foreign strikebreakers and attack the striking workers with disciplinary warnings, dismissals and offence reports.</p>
<p>The German IWW supports the workers&rsquo; cause and asks you to show them some international support as well</p>
<p>They have launched an e-mail campaign and prepared some pre-formulated and addressed e-mails to selected recipient&rsquo;s who have a significant role in this struggle. These e-mails&nbsp; are provided in English too and can be generated with a mouse click. All you had to do is to sign and send them off. You can of course change the content of the mails to personalize them if you like. It would be great if you added information from where you are writing.</p>
<p>The German Wobblies rely on many of you to participate for they are still small in numbers and their only strength is in their internationality. For many long weeks now, the Neupack Workers hold out in front of their factories in a grueling labor conflict. This campaign would only cost you a couple of minutes in front of your computer.</p>

<p>Thanks for your solidarity!<br />

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 05/22/2012 - 7:57pm</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../../../sites/default/files/images/IWWPatch1.png" />The International Solidarity Commission of the Industrial Workers of the World condemns the actions taken by the Mossos d'Esquadra, Catalonia police. Laura G&oacute;mez, the General Secretary of CGT-Barcelona was arrested by the Mossos d'Esquadra for trumped up charges that have no basis in fact. It is obvious that this is nothing more than an act of repression and intimidation in response to the growing workers' mobilizations in Spain. We demand the immediate release of Laura G&oacute;mez and the withdrawal of all charges.</p>
<p>We are in solidarity with, and commend, the CGT-Barcelona, Laura G&oacute;mez, and the rest of Spain's working class for their ongoing struggle against police repression and labour injustice.</p>
<p>Solidarity Forever, <br />
International Solidarity Commission <br />

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 03/11/2012 - 2:17pm</p>
<p>By the IWW's International Solidarity Commission - March 8, 2012</p>
<p>The International Solidarity Commission (ISC) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) sends a message of solidarity to the striking workers at the Elliniki Halivourgia steel mill near Athens, Greece.</p>
<p>Despite a record increase in profits, the company announced its plans to cut the workers' pay by 40%. After a General Assembly of the workers unanimously rejected these cuts, management retaliated by firing 34 workers. Unintimidated, the workers went on strike, occupying their factory and demanding the re-hiring of their co-workers and the cancellation of the pay cuts.</p>
<p>Greece has become the centre of the global struggle against the capitalist crisis, and the flames of your struggle inspire other workers the world over. Rather then acquiesce to the official lie of a nation united in necessary sacrifice for the common good, you have exposed the truth that the working class are not the cause of the crisis and will not pay for it.</p>
<p>The ISC applauds the brave actions of these steelworkers and urges other workers in similar circumstances to look to the example being set at Elliniki Halivourgia.</p>
