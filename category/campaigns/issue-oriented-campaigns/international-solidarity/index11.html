<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 05/25/2007 - 11:37am</p>
<p><em>The Bay Area IWW participated in the organizing of this event and members attended the pickets.</em></p><p><strong>By Steve Zeltser and Jeff Paterson, May 19, 2007</strong></p><p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../../../graphics/IU510/people/10-dontmove-526.jpg" />Dozens of anti-war protesters including the leadership and many members of the Oakland Education Association OEA joined the picket lines this morning and in the evening of the &nbsp;SSA (Stevedoring Services of America)shipping terminal in Oakland, California to protest the war and the lack of funding for schools in Oakland. The picketers demanded that the US get out of Iraq and called on other trade unionists throughout the United States to mobilize in action to stop the war.<br /></p><p>The action which began at in the early morning before the first day shift of ILWU Local 10 longshoremen and women as well as longshore clerks of ILWU Local 34 was organized to encourage the dockworkers to honor the picket line which they are allowed to do under their contract. As a result of a political &nbsp;education campaign in the ILWU Local 10, most workers were fully in support of the picket and did not cross the line. Newly elected Democratic mayor Ronald Dellums had also sent a letter to the Port Action committee that organized the picket which declared that the war &quot;had been a blunder&quot; and said he opposed the war. The police however not only prevented anti-war picketer from driving to the docks in the morning but also stopped major news media from bringing their vans to the picketlines to cover the demonstration. The police when questioned by this reporter said that the news vans were not allowed in the area since it was &nbsp;a &quot;safety issue&quot;. In 2003, the Oakland police in collaboration with the SSA company and state security forces launched a violent attack on a similar anti-war protest. They also shot at many ILWU members for the first time since the 1930's.<br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

Beaver wore a T-shirt saying, &quot;Not my president.&quot; Various piercings, tattoos, red-streaked hair. One smoked a cigar, another a pipe. One carried a police-style riot shield.<br /><br />Travis Stuckey, another organizer, showed up a bit late. &quot;It's the first time I've ever worked on May Day,&quot; he said.<br /><br />He had passed out Spanish-language pamphlets at bus stops, near the John Morrell plant and other places where Hispanic workers were likely to gather.<br /><br />As the activists waited, the discussion wandered from Cinco de Mayo to using cell phones to tell what time it is (&quot;Man, you're paying $40 a month for a watch&quot;) to a new kind of dog food that reduces poop, then turned to the U.S. economy.<br /><br />&quot;There's maybe 20 years max before this country falls into the Third World&quot; if we don't recover manufacturing jobs, Stuckey opined.<br /><br />About 5:15, Stuckey went to his vehicle to pull out signs and literature. Chris Huska of Act Now to Stop War &amp; End Racism exchanged pamphlets with Stuckey.<br /><br />When they stood near Minnesota Avenue with signs, there were a few honks - hard to tell whether in accord or in anger.<br /><br />None of the immigrants the group was trying to help showed up. But South Dakota's low pay and dearth of unions will keep these activists passing out workers rights pamphlets.<br /><br />&quot;It's needed here quite a bit,&quot; Beaver said.&nbsp;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_675 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/south-dakota-iww/" rel="tag" title="">South Dakota IWW</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_76"><a href="../../../union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all IWW Departments and Unions.
