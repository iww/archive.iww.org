<p><img src="../../../../graphics/labor/globsolired.gif" align="right" />Members of the Philadelphia General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World will picket the German Consul during his appearance at the Union League (140 South Broad St.) Thursday at noon to speak to members of the German-American Chamber of Commerce. This is the second action held in Philadelphia protesting escalating violations of basic labor rights in Germany.</p>
<p>Consul General of the Federal Republic of Germany Dr. Horst Freitag will be speaking in Philadelphia as a German appeals court meets to hear an appeal by the Free Workers Union (FAU) against a court order barring them from exercising basic labor rights, including describing themselves as a union, appealing to the public to support their members engaged in industrial disputes, or seeking to negotiate with employers for better conditions.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_243 first"><a href="../../../branches/all-branches/philadelphia-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Philadelphia General Membership Branch.

</p><p>To friends and comrades in Greece,</p>
<p>On Thursday, May 13 a dozen of us held a demonstration against the Greek Consulate in Chicago. We want to remind you that even in the most difficult times, you have the active solidarity of uncounted others around the world. A vast subversive project is still taking shape everywhere, however slowly, and your struggle is one node among many.</p>
<p>Repression may be raging against you there, and our numbers here might be small, but the important thing to remember is that you've found your resonance.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 06/02/2010 - 1:51am</p>
<p><b>By Jonathan Christiansen</b></p>
<p>On Monday 12 April Amirul Amin and myself met with outgoing Political Officer /Human Rights Officer) David Arulanantham, and his incoming replacement, Forrest Graham.</p>
<p>The meeting began with introductions. We then discussed the human rights mission of the office and further discussed the 2009 Bangladesh human rights report that the office had recently released. David told us it could be found on the State.gov website.</p>
<p>Amin explained that he had met with the previous officer Mr. Gupta on several occasions. He explained that many of the past struggles in the EPZS involved the NGWF including the YEOWMON (?) (Korean owned garment Factory) struggle. He further explained that the US has a major influence on the Bangladesh government. He stated that the Bangladesh min. Wage is 1,662 taka per month, which is appallingly low (about US $24 a month).</p>
<p>Amin then went on to explain problems with current labor law in BD and problems with enforcement.

<p>By John Jacobsen - <i>Fellow Worker Jacobsen is a labor activist currently living in Seattle, Washington. He works as a welder’s apprentice with the Boilermakers Local 104, and is an organizer with both the Seattle Solidarity Network and the Industrial Workers of the World. He has written and spoken on labor and anti-war topics to audiences from Seattle to Portland to London.</i> Originally Posted at <a href="https://thetbf.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/arizonas-immigration-law-and-mayday/" target="_blank">Trial by Fire</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/16/AzSB1070.pdf" target="_self">Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act</a> would require immigrants in the state of Arizona to carry their alien registration documents on their persons at all times. It also requires police to question any person they may reasonably suspect is in the U.S. illegally.</p>
<p>The Act comes after years of increased public outcry for better enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.</p>
<p>In response, grassroots organizations all over the country, from faith-based groups to labor unions, poured into the streets on May 1st to demand a repeal of the Arizona reforms.</p>
<p>May 1st, also known as International Workers&#8217; Day, has traditionally marked the anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_Massacre" target="_blank">Haymarket Massacre</a> in Chicago, 1886. But recently, the holiday has served as rallying point for labor activists and immigrant rights advocates to gather around.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Backlash &#8211; Mayday, 2010:</span></strong></p>
<p>In all, over 90 cities saw tens of thousands of protestors march, and a large number of high-profile politicians and celebrities speak out against the Arizona law.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AROZcIw0qio" target="_blank">this video</a>, you can see U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) being arrested for participating in an act of civil disobedience at the white house.</p>
<p>In another high-profile disagreement with Arizona, the Major League Baseball Players Association <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-zirin/this-is-racist-stuff-base_b_559738.html" target="_blank">released a statement</a> condemning SB1070.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20100502/D9FECDM00.html" target="_blank">Chicago</a>, between eight and fifteen thousand people gathered in support of immigrant rights only days after activists attempted to physically <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-illinois-immigration-anger2-20100427,0,7206749.story?obref=obinsite" target="_blank">block deportation vans</a> in their city. In Dallas, around 20,000 rallied.</p>
<p>Los Angelas saw by far the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/immigration/la-me-0502-immig-rally-20100502,0,5011733.story" target="_blank">largest protests</a>, massing about 50,000 marchers at its height, focusing predominantly on the Arizona reforms. Five coalitions, representing over 150 labor, faith, and immigrant rights organizations banded together to put out the call for the protests. Protestors in the march chanted &#8220;boycott Arizona,&#8221; and wore t-shirts asking &#8220;do I look illegal?&#8221;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../../../../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
