<p class="redbar"><a name="tourism"></a>Tourism</p>
<p>Like the sugar plantations before it, the tourist industry exploits
Hawai'i and prostitutes Hawaiian culture. Most hotels, restaurants, tour
companies, gift shops and golf courses belong to foreign corporations.
Through "our" taxes, we pay for the resources that tourists and the
tourist industry use-- airports, roads, water, a convention center, the UH
School of Travel Industry Management, and other infrastructure throughout
the islands. We provide the land for their airports, hotels and golf
courses, and indigenous Hawaiians and local people get evicted if they are
"in the way." Yet the profits of tourism almost all go out of the state
into the pockets of the multinationals. Most large hotels in Hawai'i are
Japanese-owned, for example.</p>
<p>The argument that tourism is a necessary evil because of the jobs it
provides is a shibai. Tourism produces mostly low-paid, dead-end jobs with
few benefits and little security. Many jobs are part-time (so the employer
avoids paying benefits), physically hard, monotonous and demanding:
carrying bags, cleaning rooms and toilets, working in hot laundries and
kitchens, waiting tables, dancing and singing on demand. Local people have
to work all hours to make ends meet. With over 60% of families needing two
or more wage earners and so many parents having to work at two or even
three jobs, we end up with serious child care problems.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a name="education"></a>Education</p>
<p>Hawai'i has a highly centralized public school system-- one that still
reflects its colonial origins and forces schools through the homogenizing
and "dumbing down" process that passes for education in the US. Local
students do badly on US tests, many schools are in terrible physical
condition, and teachers are poorly trained and paid. The rich and the
would-be rich put their children in private schools-- some of them the
same ones established by the missionaries who overthrew the kingdom of
Hawai'i a century ago. The rest go to public schools which mostly get
publicized for ethnic violence and football, and which train students for
low-wage, dehumanizing jobs in the tourist industry and other service
industries. In fact, one of the main reasons for years of underfunding of
primary, secondary and tertiary education in Hawai'i is a local economy
whose principal need is for poorly educated, obedient employees to fill
jobs only requiring minimal training.</p>
<p>So-called "School-Community-Based Management" is not the answer.
Education policy-setting and major decision-making power is retained by
the state, while responsibility for implementation (and, increasingly,
funding) is delegated to the schools themselves. Children should not have
to raise money for books or beg corporations for computers.</p>
<p>A strong IWW presence in Hawai'i's educational system would lead to
real local control and very high standards. It would lead to local
teachers, school staff, parents, and students taking full responsibility,
with adequate financial support, for devising cirricula and teaching
strategies which respect local culture (and cultural diversity). There
would be many alternative schools. Hawaiian immersion education and adult
education would be greatly extended and open to all who choose them.
"Pigdin" (Hawai'i's Creole English) would be respected for what it is-- a
legitimate local variety of English-- and added to, not "abolished" by an
out-of-touch school board. (There would be no Board or Department of
Education.) Local communities would develop genuinely cooperative
decision-making to meet the needs of their schools. And it would lead to
students developing their intellectual, physical and sociocultural talents
in tune with their and their community's intrests and needs.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a name="issues"></a>Hawaiian Issues</p>
<p>The IWW fully supports the fundamental right of kanaka maoli (native
people of Hawai'i) to self-determination. We see the arrival of Captain
Cook, the onslaught of the missionaries, the usurpation of land, and the
overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy for what they are: Attacks on the
indigenous people of these islands and on their cultural integrity. For
centuries, imperialist powers have taken, either by force or duplicity,
land, raw materials, and human resources for their own profit, typically
justifying such behavior as "civilizing heathen peoples." The IWW joins
the kanaka maoli in demanding justice from the US and the state of Hawai'i
for over a century of oppression and virtual genocide.</p>
<p>The IWW respects the right of Hawaiians to determine how they will
relate to each other and to non-Hawaiians. Given that Wobblies oppose
human relationships based on heirarchy, dominance and coercion, however,
we will not support the replacement of two authoritarian states (the US
federal and Hawai'i state governments) with three: a state within a state
within a state, based on the model imposed on native peoples in the US.
One state is already one too many. We will actively support initiatives by
Hawaiians to develop worker control of the economy, equal participation in
political life, and full freedom of cultural expression.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
