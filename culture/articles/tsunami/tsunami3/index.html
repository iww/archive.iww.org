<p>The drive to organize Kinko's workers in Santa Cruz was started in 1993
along with the founding of the Santa Cruz Branch. The focus of both the
drive and the branch was the I.W.W. slogan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education,</li>
<li>Organization,</li>
<li>Emancipation.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, appropriately enough, our first efforts at Kinko's were all related
to educating the workers about their legal rights, general labor history
and theory, and the history of Kinko's itself. From the beginning, we
decided to have the I.W.W. delegates who were working at Kinko's act as
co-worker advocates in an unofficial capacity.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/agitators/modern/BayArea/tsunamihammer.jpg" align="right" />
These concepts worked well as we continued to develop them. We held
weekly "cafes" in the homes of fellow workers where we answered questions,
exchanged literature, played Bridge, Scrabble, and sang many a raucous
union song. Hosting these gatherings for fellow workers in their homes,
delegates became known as reliable sources of information and responsible
representatives of the union. These dedicated Kinkoids served as
Co-workers' advocates on the job site and were able to make both effective
changes in Co-worker culture as well as in immediate working
conditions.</p>
<p>After several months of educating Co-workers about their history and
legal rights, an important ideological change happened on the shop floor:
Co-workers started taking responsibility for their rights themselves and
started asking questions about what they should be doing.</p>
<p>We have addressed many issues of concern for Kinko's Co-workers, such
as: Health and Safety codes, timeliness of reviews and raises, unannounced
schedule changes, the dress code, and generally bad managerial attitudes.
There seem to be as many direct action tactics as there are Co-workers;
Kinkoids are nothing if not creative. As a delegate, my favorite tactic is
to schedule myself to give an immediately useful presentation at our
mandatory monthly store meetings. So far I've instituted an emergency plan
for the building (there wasn't even a First-Aid Kit when I was hired),
given a talk about copyright law, and presented a workshop on how to fill
out order forms and translate Kinko's arcane, in-store symbols. All
delegates in our store seem to make it their business to be the life of
the party at monthly meetings. We bravely ask pertinent questions like
"Won't Workers Compensation stop covering us if we don't have a safety
training program?" or "What is `practically non-toxic in rats' supposed to
mean, anyway?" (from the <u>Material Data Safety Handbook</u>). The
Co-workers quickly picked up on this idea and started asking anything and
everything they wanted to. The managers in turn were properly dismayed and
finally asked us if we wouldn't like to go bowling instead. We politely
declined.</p>
<p>Another prominent change in store culture came with the arrival of the
first Co-worker Factszine; this publication changed not only the attitudes
of Co-workers and their managers, but affected nationwide company policy
as well. In every store of our region, the bosses removed our bulletin
boards and replaced them with ones reserved only for company information.
All outside publications, such as daily and weekly newspapers, were
removed from the stores on command from regional administration. This
created quite a stir with the customers who were used to having something
to read in line at Kinko's.</p>
<p>The Co-workers themselves had mixed feelings about the Factszine. On
one side it had brought more restrictions to their workplace, but on the
other side they discovered that they were not alone in organizing at
Kinko's. The Factszine also had the effect of forcing some Co-workers out
of the closet as I.W.W. members, thereby making them more visible and
effective. As things have heated up, Co-workers have also become
interested in coming to meetings outside the store. Currently, more
Co-workers are coming to Branch meetings as well as meeting frequently on
their own. Some Co-workers have developed a positive habit of meeting
after work to bitch about their jobs and share information. This is a
surprisingly sustainable tactic and one that our managers haven't failed
to notice.</p>
<p>At present, Kinko's Wobblies are experiencing a "changing of the
guard." Several 'K-Wobs' have left recently and new ones have taken on
delegate status to fill their shoes. We view this as a sign of the
sustainability of our drive and a validation of our original goals as well
as the delegate system. As Co-workers leave our store, they take their
experiences as organizers with them to other workplaces in Santa Cruz and
to other Kinko's all over the U.S. In other words, we think our plan is
working.</p>
