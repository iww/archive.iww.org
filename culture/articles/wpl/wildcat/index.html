<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p> By Arthur J Miller</p>
<p>Hand over hand, pulling myself up the derrick of a 90-foot wildcat oil
rig. Each handhold sticks to the frozen ladder as the rig shakes to the
wildcat beat of drilling. The East Texas winter wind cuts through you with
a vengeance that has no mercy for any fool that crosses its path. Finally
reaching the crown, I knock off the ice that has accumulated, only to hear
the toolpusher yell out that the feed pump has gone down. Back down the
frozen latter I go to prime the pump that only seems to go down when I'm
up upon the cat's crown.</p>
<p>"Hey! Mister Pusherman, how does one take lunch on this rig?" "With one
hand", he replies. 12 hours on, then 12 hours off, seven days a week, this
wildcat slave worked. The cat don't stop for a damn thing; no holidays, no
sick days, the wildcat never rests in its pursuit for that black gold.</p>
<p>And the wildcat slave only has time to eat, sleep, shit and work; ain't
no time or energy for much else. All this so that you good folks can drive
your nice four wheelers around. This ain't no life, the slave thinks, only
a brutal means of survival.</p>
<p>I caught on to the wildcat in northern Mississippi after the cat hit an
aquifer and the back-pressure came up the hole and killed three slaves.
The bossman needing new replacement slaves and hired me on. We broke the
cat down and hauled it off to East Texas. There we set the cat up to try
again.</p>
<p>Most oil rigs have five stiffs per shift, a driller, two tongmen, one
chainthrower and a derrick hand, who is also responsible for the pump. The
man who runs the show is called the toolpusher. The gangs of roughnecks
that work oil rigs don't think much of intellectual fantasies of dream
worlds, for the real world shakes them to the bone. A real world that
others care not to see or think about.</p>
<p>Have you ever, good folks, given one moment of thought to what lies
behind those things you spend your cash on? The roughneck, the truck
driver, the sailor of the merchant marine, the factory worker down on the
speedup line, the farm worker out in the fields, the miner down in some
deep dark hole, all the slaves that endure hardship so that you may
consume. Do you ever see the blood; the pain and the sweat that is upon
each thing you buy? Do you think about the sweatshop workers who make the
clothes you wear? Or what of child labor? Do you think about the loss of
their childhood when you buy the products they make? Do you hear the cries
of Mother Earth when she is raped to support a lifestyle?</p>
<p>Many people just don't want to know about these things. Ignorance is
bliss. Others just don't give a damn, no matter what you tell them. All
they care about is what they have, to hell with everyone else. Some will
respond by telling you how hard their life is. But in the reality of
things, this system that makes so many suffer, is only able to do this
because we allow it.</p>
<p>Every person plays a part in the system of exploitation. Guilt lies in
apathy and not doing anything about it.</p>
<p>Do you really think you can escape the environmental disaster that this
industrial system is creating by ignoring it? Do you realize that we
humans are a part of the ecological system? And how we humans treat each
other is a part of how we treat the environment. The system of
exploitation treats people in the same way as it treats the rest of the
ecological system.</p>
<p>The system likes to individualize our concerns so that we care only
what happens to ourselves. What it does not want you to understand is that
what happens to others and the rest of the ecological system has a direct
effect on each of us. The decision on if we are willing pawns of the
system, or if we are willing to do something about it, is ours alone to
make. You can become a rebel, you can resist, you can fight back, you can
join with others to set things right.</p>
<p>You may be thinking; "What diffidence can I make?" The answer to that
is in the realization that the resistance to the system of exploitation is
built one person at a time. You are either a part of the system, or a part
of the resistance. There ain't no fence to sit on, there ain't no middle
ground. So in understanding this, the time has come for you to ask
yourself; "Which side are you on?"</p>
<p>Once we got the rig to East Texas, the bossman put us up in a hotel. We
all thought that the company would be paying the hotel bill as they did in
Mississippi. We got paid every two weeks on this job, and our payday came
on the day after we arrived. In the next two weeks we set up the rig and
began around the clock drilling.</p>
<p>Come payday the toolpusher told us that the hotel had our checks and
that we had to pay up our hotel bill out of them. This was a major problem
for many of us because, as our money ran low we charged our food on
credit. This meant we had to pay both our food and hotel room bill at the
same time. Most of us did not have enough money from our check to do
this.</p>
<p>As our anger grew, out of the hotel managers office came the Sheriff
and a number of his deputies. He told us that if we had a problem with
this he had jail cells for us all. Then we were told to clear
up our bills and to get the hell out of his county. Since this forced us
all to 'quit', the bossman did not have to pay us off until the next
payday, which was not until two weeks. But he said that he would advance
us money out of that check to pay our bills if we agreed to leave town.
Being a bit of a rebel worker, I was rather vocal about this arrangement.
The porkers told me that if I did not shut my mouth, payup my bill and get
the hell out of their county, that my family, who was with me, would join
me in jail.</p>
<p>This whole scam was planned in advance by the company to save them
money. In Mississippi the company was unable to get experienced
roughnecks. So they had to bring them in from the outside and put them up
in a hotel. In East Texas they had two weeks to find a completely new
crew. Which they were able to do. Since we did not have a contract or any
written agreement, there was nothing we could do about this.</p>
<p>After my bill was paid up, I loaded my family and our few belongings in
to our old pickup truck and made our way down the highway. We were given
an escort to the county line by one of the deputies. Once at the county
line he pulled us over and he gave me a lecture about my big mouth and bad
attitude. He then told us that if he ever saw us in his county again he
would throw us in jail.</p>
<p>Behind everything you buy, there are stories about exploited workers.
My story is but one among millions that could be told. The next time you
pull up for a tank of gas, remember my story, and think about all the
stories still untold, that went in to producing the fuel for your car. And
if you are able to do this then you have taken a step in understanding the
truth about the world we live in.</p>
