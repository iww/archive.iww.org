<p> By Arthur J Miller</p>
<p><b>Unnatural Disaster</b></p>
<p>Over the CB radio in my truck I heard the warning of the impending
explosion that would set the New Carissa afire. I parked the truck and
climbed up a hill overlooking the freighter aground in the surf. Waves
were beating upon the hull of the ship as if they were trying to rid that
foul thing from their domain. I thought how ironic it seemed, a human made
creation of steel being subdued by the forces of nature. When will the
human race learn that no matter what it can create, the forces of nature
will always be more powerful? Though I looked upon the results of human
folly, I was unprepared for what I was about to see.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/IU510/images/newcar2.jpg" align="left" /> In the
infinite madness of human planning, bangalore torpedoes - metal tubes
containing explosives - were used to breach the ship's fuel tanks,
allowing the pressurized bunker oil to rush into the cargo holds. In the
holds they placed twelve 55-gallon drums of napalm which were
simultaneously ignited by C-4 plastic explosives. Two huge explosions, one
right after the other, lit up the sky. The last one sent a bright yellow
ball of flames towering hundreds of feet into the air. All my senses
became overwhelmed by what was happening. First the brightness of the
explosion, then almost as joined forces the loudness to my ears and the
shock wave that pushed upon my body and made the ground that I stood on
tremble. Then came the thick odor of burning fuel that I could not keep
from tasting in my mouth. A large black cloud of smoke drifted in the wind
away from the ship carrying with it contaminants from the oil, the lead
paint from the ship's bulkheads and everything else that was burning on
the ship.</p>
<p>When my eyes could see the ship again I could see that there was a fire
burning from the stern to the bow. After a little while the fire burned so
hot that parts of the hull began to glow orange. I knew then that the ship
would break up. A few hours later I heard on the news that it had broken
into two parts.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I am tired and a bit down, I wonder if our struggles
have any real purpose. My thoughts right after what I had seen, made me
once again understand that our struggles are not just about issues and
grand ideas, but that all the struggles are about resisting the insanity
of the industry monster built upon the unnatural lust of power and greed.
Mother Earth warns us that we cannot dominate her and that we travel our
misguided path at the risk of our own doom.</p>
<p><b>Cleaning Up</b></p>
<p>The Japanese owned, Panama registered 639-foot New Carissa ran aground
on February fourth, about a hundred and fifty yards offshore and a few
miles north of the inlet to Coos Bay, Oregon. The ship had lost power
while waiting to enter Coos Bay for a load of wood chips. While being
pounded by waves cracks began to develop in the hull and the fuel tanks
which carried a hundred and forty thousand gallons of bunker oil. Some of
the oil began to leak from the ship and wash ashore onto the beach. On
February tenth an attempt was made to burn the fuel that remained on the
ship, but it failed to do so.</p>
<p>That night I received a call from an environmental company that I work
for from time to time, they told me that they needed to get every
qualified person that they could find down to Coos Bay. I left a few hours
later bound for Portland where I picked up a truck which I drove to Coos
Bay. I arrived at the base of operations, which was a mass of trucks,
equipment and people from a number of environmental companies, the Coast
Guard and the Oregon National Guard. After I signed in I was put to work.
Later that day they tried to set the ship afire again with a massive
explosion. After starting my day at half past three in the morning I
finally got to my motel a little after eight o'clock that night.</p>
<p>The next morning I received a wake up call at five o'clock, loaded up
the truck and made my way out to the base again. There we suited up in our
protective gear and went out to the beach to work on cleaning up the
mess.</p>
<p>When I caught sight of the ship I was stunned at the sight of it. It
was still on fire, but broken into two parts. In the fog, with the smoke
coming out of it and waves moving between the two sections of the burnt
out ship, it looked like something out of an apocalypse movie. Like a
symbol of the destruction of industrialized western civilization.</p>
<p>Along with a few hundred others, I began to dig up thick globs of
bunker oil off the beach. The clean-up effort was very disorganized and it
seemed to me that much of it was for show only. All-terrain vehicles
(ATVs) were running up and down the beach spreading the oil contamination
and pressing it deeper down into the sand. And then with oil on their
tires, the ATVs would run off the beach. With the destruction of the
fragile plant life on the sand dunes by ATVs, trucks, equipment and
people, I had to wonder if we were doing more harm to the environment than
good.</p>
<p>Like all capitalist businesses, the environmental companies are out for
a profit. Thus, environmental disasters become good opportunities for
these companies to make a lot of money. Nobody seemed to give a damn about
the reality of what was happening to Mother Earth!</p>
<p>If anyone cared there were a number of things that should have
logically been done. First, they should have cleaned a path high on the
beach for the ATVs, which were needed to remove the bags of shoveled up
oil and contaminated sand. Then they should have removed all the
driftwood. This seems almost too obvious to anyone who can think. If you
have contaminated driftwood what will happen to it when the high tide
comes back in? Here is a clue, why do they call it driftwood? And the
driftwood that is not contaminated, what will happen to it when it drifts
back out in the oil in the water?</p>
<p>Most of the bunker oil that leaked from the ship did not wash up on the
beaches, rather it sunk to the ocean floor. Bunker oil, when it is not
heated, is thick like tar. So what is not washed up will sink to the
bottom killing all marine life that it covers. As time passes on some of
it will slowly wash up onto the beach. Some of the bunker oil will break
up into smaller balls of oil. These balls of oil have been found as far as
fifty miles to the north and are getting close to the Sea Lion Caves.</p>
<p>Along with the bunker oil, a good deal of diesel fuel was spilled. Both
caused a fuel slick on the water and some of it had made its way into Coos
Bay threatening the shell fish industry there. I left Coos Bay after four
days because the company I worked for wanted me to head back up north to
pick up another truck loaded with equipment. When I took one last look at
the broken up ship, the stern was listing at about twenty degrees and it
seemed to me that in time it would capsize. The bow was anchored and had
been moving with the tides. From what I heard they planned to tow both
parts of the ship out as far as they could and let it sink.</p>
<p><b>Flag of Convenience</b></p>
<p>I cannot write about this without also writing about what causes such
disasters. Ships have always been at danger upon the oceans of the world.
But in the last twenty years that danger has increased. The reason for
that is the spread of what are called "flag of convenience" ships. To get
away from safety, environmental, and labor laws and labor unions, many
ship owners register their ships in countries that have little or no
maritime regulations. The three countries that most of these ships are
registered in are Panama, the Bahamas and Liberia. These ships are not
maintained well, are not inspected very often and the crews are made up of
the lowest paid workers that can be found. Basically these are cheap ships
that the owners keep sailing until they sink or breakdown somewhere and
are often abandoned, sometimes with the crew still aboard with no way to
get back home. Many of these ships have such a tangled web of ownership
that it is hard to find out who the real owner is. Many times they can
only be traced back to a Post Office Box in the country they are
registered in.</p>
<p>The New Carissa is registered in Panama, but the Panamanian company is
nothing more than a post office box. Then it seems to go from there to a
company in the Philippines which is owned by the Japanese shipping
conglomerate Nippon Yusen Kaisha.</p>
<p>Nine times out of ten a ship that is involved in a maritime disaster is
a "flag of convenience" ship with a nonunion crew. The importance of union
crews, beyond the well-being of the workers, is that they are experienced
and will not sail a dangerous ship.</p>
<p>What has the U.S. Government done about the increased danger in the
maritime industry? In the '80s, without increasing the size of the U.S.
Coast Guard (as a matter of fact they have cut their funds) the government
redirected the Coast Guard into their so-called "war on drugs". This has
meant far fewer ships are inspected and there is a great reduction in the
Coast Guard's ability to respond in an emergency.</p>
<p>And last there is ship construction. It is possible to build ships that
are earth friendly, but they are not built that way. They are built as
cheap as possible for maximum profit for the owners. This is something
that I know about because I have worked for over twenty years as a marine
pipefitter and sometimes as a shipfitter.</p>
<p>What the human made disasters of the world come down to is the disaster
of the so-called civilization we live in. The values of power and greed
have been placed as the prime motivation in our world. If profit can be
made, the effects on people and Mother Earth are of little concern to the
profiteers. That is why we live out of balance with Mother Earth and we
find ourselves in conflict with her. In time if we do not change the way
we live our world will be nothing more than what the New Carissa has
become.</p>
<p><b>The Little Tugboat that Couldn't</b></p>
<p>The little tugboat that thought it could, tugged and tugged away. After
a few days it had gotten that mean old bow section of the New Carissa
about fifty miles out to sea. But the Mother of us all was not done
teaching some of her foolish children a lesson. Though our Mother may be
made up of many delicate things that humans seem to be able to harm with
ease, still she is a powerful force that her foolish children will never
dominate. Mother Earth kicked up her winds and high seas and snapped the
towline. And the little tugboat that thought it could found out that it
could not, and sat helplessly watching as the winds and surf threw the bow
of the New Carissa back up upon the beach. With the little tugboat's ego
deflated, it decided to try again hoping that the next time Mother Earth
would not spank it's behind once more.</p>
<p><b>The New Frankenstein.</b></p>
<blockquote>"I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon
these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile
triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of
that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by
the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not
surely think thus. Farewell." The final words of Frankenstein's monster
from Frankenstein by Mary Shelly, 1816.</blockquote>
<p>From ages untold some of humankind has sought to conquer all that is
and bend it to their will. As if creation itself is but a servant to those
would-be masters of all. But sometimes, those would-be masters of all,
find that they cannot master the forces of Mother Earth, sometimes they
find that they cannot even master their own creations.</p>
<p>The New Carissa, is nothing more than a modern-day Frankenstein's
monster. Which, upon a stormy night, went aground, fouling Mother Earth
with its spilled oil. The foolish would-be masters still thought they
could control the monster they had created and set fire to the oil on
their creation. The heat from the fire and the forces of nature, wind and
surf tore the metal creature in half, but only a little of the oil burnt.
Time and time again they tried to reset the flames only to be met with
failure.</p>
<p>Then the creature's masters tried to tow the bow section out to sea.
But the forces of Mother Earth proved greater and swept the bow back up on
the beach. And again oil stained the beaches and sunk below the surf. At
first the masters tried to deny the truth, for they were caught in a lie.
They had told the world that the oil still aboard their monster was no
longer a threat. But that "non-threatening" oil was washing up on shores
all the way to Long Beach, Washington.</p>
<p>Once again they towed their metal creation off the beach and out to
sea. Upon the old ship they lowered their explosive "experts" who planted
explosive charges. From a distance the charges were set off, but this
Frankenstein's monster would not die an easy death. Determined that their
execution would be carried out the foolish ones opened fire with seventy
rounds from their five-inch gun. Though battered from the onslaught, the
defiant monster would not be destroyed. Finally a nuclear submarine was
brought into the battle and it hurled a torpedo that brought the New
Carissa down.</p>
<p><b>Eco-Tourism</b></p>
<p>The stern of the New Carissa is still there on the beach. So many
people have come out to see the stern section that the state has started
to charge people $10 to get in to view it. Just think about that, ten
bucks to see half of a decapitated metal monstrosity that symbolizes the
arrogance and decadence of modern industrialized profit-driven society.
Them silly folks would even sell tickets to their own destruction!</p>
<p>The plan now is to use a "jack-up barge" that will drop huge legs down
into the sand (damaging the marine life) to provide a stable work
platform. Then work crews will cut up the stern into twenty to thirty ton
chunks to be hauled away as scrap. This they say will take three or four
months to complete. Though there is still oil in the stern (which keeps
leaking out and fouling the beach - they still have work crews
continuously cleaning this up), the same "officials" that said all their
other actions would be safe, are claiming that this new action will also
be environmentally safe. I wonder if there is anyone who still believes
anything these "officials" say about anything? Well maybe it is possible
to fool most of the people most of the time. Specially when you are able
to sell them a spectacle at the same time. People will buy anything if you
just package it right and do a little marketing.</p>
<p>When it is done the foolish ones will think that the end of their
ordeal has come. But upon the seas of the world sail a thousand New
Carissas, each one capable of becoming a sequel. For these foolish masters
understand not: Frankenstein's monster has many sons.</p>
<p><b>Insanity on the Oceans</b></p>
<p>The insanity that is played out upon our oceans does not only affect
the environment of Mother Earth, but it also has a human toll. A little
known situation has been going on off the coast of South Padre Island,
Texas. Twenty three Pakistani crewmen of the Delta Pride, a broken down
freighter, were stranded aboard that ship for ten months. The SOS calls of
the crew were ignored and they ran out of fuel so there was no power for
lights or cooking. For water they had to save rainwater and had to fish in
order to eat. Though the Delta Pride had made millions of dollars hauling
coal, bauxite, scrap iron and grain, the crew was abandoned. Finally they
were taken off the ship to be sent home after some people started to
protest about what was happening. If there had been no protest the rich
maritime owners and the U.S. government would have just left them there to
die.</p>
<p><b>Environmental Temps</b></p>
<p>I have worked such jobs as a marine pipefitter and as a long haul truck
driver. When I am unable to find work in those areas I work as an
environmental technician temporary (temp) worker. This is how I found
myself working on the cleanup of the oil spill from the New Carissa.
Environmental temps are used to work what is called hazmat sites.</p>
<p>Hazmat sites are divided up into four levels ('A' being the most
hazardous, 'B', 'C', and 'D') based upon how hazardous the site is and
what Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is needed. The hazmat site itself
is suppose to be a controlled access site.</p>
<p>A hazmat site has what they call site controls. The contaminated area
is called the Exclusion Zone (sometimes also called the Hot Zone). This
zone is restricted to qualified people who have the required PPE. The
Exclusion Zone is set up with whatever engineering controls are possible
to contain the contamination. The outer boundary of the Exclusion Zone is
called the Hotline.</p>
<p>No one without what is called Hazwhoper training is allowed to cross
the Hotline. Hazwhoper is an OSHA required training of forty hours for
workers that work hazmat sites. Every year these workers must take an
eight hour refresher training in order to keep their forty hour cards up
to date. The state of Washington is what is called a designated state and
runs its own hazmat program. Whereas, with OSHA a forty hour card allows
you to work any level site, in Washington you need and additional forty
hours to work 'A' and 'B' sites (an eighty hour card). Most environmental
hazmat workers and all environmental hazmat temps are forced to pay for
their own training.</p>
<p>Surrounding the Exclusion Zone is the Contamination Reduction Zone
(which is also called the Warm Zone). This is the transition area where
workers and equipment are decontaminated. In this zone the workers PPE is
washed off and disposed of.</p>
<p>Surrounding the Contamination Reduction Zone is the Contamination
Control Line and no contamination should ever pass over that line. Outside
of that line is the Support Zone (which is also called the Cold Zone). In
this area will be found the Command Post and it is used as a staging area.
Access to each zone is controlled by Access Control Points which are
placed downwind from the contamination.</p>
<p>This is how things are supposed to work, but often the sites do not
function as they should. I worked a hazmat site once at Boeing where a
group of suit and ties just walked right through our boundaries (opening
up our containment of contaminated air) and into the Exclusion Zone. There
these fools were given a tour of the site while we stood there all suited
up in our PPE looking at them.</p>
<p>On many sites that I have worked, even the basic containment and
decontamination procedures are not put into place. I worked lime tanks at
a pulp mill (lime is a base compound that is very corrosive) where the
only decontamination we had was a low pressure shower that did not remove
much of the lime then they had us just walk out of the area (no zones were
marked). A number of temps got burns from the lime because of the shabby
decontamination and improper PPEs.</p>
<p>I have worked sites where we were not given any information on the
hazards, there were no Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) around (which is
required by law). They have had us set up scaffolding which we were
untrained for. They have had us go into confined spaces without posted
permits or qualified hole watches. To put it simply, there are few laws
that I have not seen violated when companies use environmental temps.</p>
<p>Though we environmental temps are always told that we should not work
in unsafe conditions, the reality of our work is that we don't have the
means to do anything about our situation. If we complain the companies
will say that they don't want that person back, and the environmental temp
agencies will not dispatch us for any more work. Though we could file
complaints with OSHA or the state and maybe win, but we will never get
work from the agencies again.</p>
<p>Temp workers are viewed as lower class workers by the companies and
most labor unions. The companies make great profits off us, but the unions
are only harming themselves by looking down upon temps. Without organized
solidarity between full time workers and temps the unions are not only
losing jobs, but also they will find it harder to maintain their wages,
benefits and conditions. The idea of an aristocracy of labor only keeps
working people divided while the bosses reap in the profits from our
weakness.</p>
<p>Like in other industries, environmental temps have become a necessity.
In situations like the oil spill from the New Carissa, without the
environmental temps there would not be the workers to handle emergencies.
But just because we are temps does not mean we are lower class workers.
Only a small part of the environmental industry is unionized. And I am not
aware of any effort to organize the great numbers of non-union workers in
this industry. But this is something that needs to change.</p>
<p>For the reasons of good wages, benefits, safe working conditions and
for real environmental protection there needs to be industrial organizing
within this industry. But for this to happen there needs to be a bond of
solidarity between full time company workers and temps. And they should
all be organized into the same industrial union. If this were to happen,
then full time company workers and temps could not be used against each
other, but rather would be an industrial force that the bosses could not
defeat.</p>
<p>No amount of federal or state laws can truly protect workers
if they do not have their own organization to back them up. There is one
labor organization that views all working people as equals and stands
against the idea of an aristocracy of labor. This organization, the
Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) stands for all workers in any
industry (regardless of whether they are full time company workers or
temps) organizing together in the same industrial union. The IWW believes
that any struggle of any group of workers in any industry is the struggle
of all workers. As the preamble to the IWW Constitution puts
it:</p>
<blockquote>These conditions can be changed and the interests of the
working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all
its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease
work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus
making an injury to one an injury to all.</blockquote>
<p>Such an organization within the environmental industry would ensure
safe working conditions and better pay for all. Also, the IWW believes
that those who do the work should control the work. One step in that
direction would be driving the temp agencies (job sharks) out of business,
establishing union hiring halls and forcing the companies to pay for
training rather than the workers having to pay for it.</p>
<p>The story of the New Carissa is but a prime example of a rotten system
that has gone very wrong. The attitude that Mother Earth and workers are
less important than the profits the bosses can make is a value of the
decadent corruption that is leaving our world polluted and creates great
human suffering. We cannot count on the bosses, laws or politicians to
ever change this situation. It can only be changed through the direct
actions of us, the people.</p>
