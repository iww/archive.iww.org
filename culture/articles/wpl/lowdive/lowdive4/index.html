<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p> By Arthur J
Miller</p>
<p>Dil got up from the table, went over to the counter and talked to a man
sitting there. They then both walked back over to the professor's table
and sat down. Dil spoke; "This fine gent we call Bindle Bill, for when he
came to our cafe he was carrying everything he owned in a bindle."</p>
<p>"Bill was a tool and die maker who found himself out on the bum after
what your world calls the new reality of economic globalization."</p>
<p>The professor then asked the following demeaning question. "What
responsibility does the working class have to changing itself in our new
global economy?"</p>
<p>Bill grew red in the face with anger and then stated; "Look Professor
Brain-dead, working people have no responsibility to your new anything. To
us there is nothing new about being exploited and robbed."</p>
<p>"When I was a young man I went out and learned myself a trade, that
being a tool and die maker. I went to work in a shop where my skills were
refined to their specialized needs. The shop was an old AFL union shop
that had been organized back in the '30s. I was active in the union and
became a union shop steward. In the early '80s the company told us that
times were hard and that they needed to cut back on our wages and benefits
in order to stay competitive, but that when times got better they would
make it up to us."</p>
<p>"Into the '90s things were really booming, but the bosses, not only did
not share with us their increased profits, they started to outsource some
of our work and laid off some of us workers. This, along with the fact
that due to inflation we were even making less in wages than when we had
our cutback, led some of us to decide that when contract time came around
we would take a stand. We turned down the company's offer and hit the
picket line."</p>
<p>"The great AFL-CIO did nothing to help us but told us strikers that we
had their sympathy. The bosses brought in replacement workers and kept the
shop working, though not very efficiently. After seven months on strike
the company offered us a different contract which we went for . . . but a
few months later we were all laid off and the company moved the shop to
Mexico."</p>
<p>"The government paid for retraining and since there was no work in my
trade, I retrained as an auto mechanic because I had always liked working
on cars. But since I had no work experience, I found out that the shops
did not like to hire on people my age to start at the bottom."</p>
<p>"Not finding work in the auto shops I tried to find work anywhere that
I could. But no matter where I went, all I heard about was my age or how
with my skills I would quit as soon as something better opened up."</p>
<p>"In time I lost my home and had pawned off damn near everything I
owned. I pulled down what day labor and longshore casual work I could, but
my situation kept on getting worse. I traveled from town to town, always
hoping for something better, but never finding it. Then one day I wandered
down this here street and ran into Harry who brought me into the low dive
for a bit to eat. Now I work at fixing the endless number of old junkers
that find their way down here."</p>
<p>"We were fools to trust the bosses and bigger fools to trust the
business union that cared nothing for us when we no longer had money for
dues. I found out the hard way that we, working folks, only have ourselves
to count on."</p>
<p>"The so-called new global economy is only another scam by the bosses to
greater exploit us working folks. The bosses are now organizing themselves
internationally, so that is what we need to also do. Then we'll start
sticking it to the rich with everything that we got. The way I see it,
there's a war between the rich and the poor and things ain't never going
to get much better until the poor win that war."</p>
<p>Next Dil brought over a man who appeared to be Hispanic. "This here
fine fellow we call Desperado Juan. His name reflects the fact that your
society views him as an 'illegal person'."</p>
<p>The professor wonder why these people had admitted to him things that
could be used against them? Well maybe they trusted him. For it is part of
the job of a good researcher to win over the trust of those he interviews
in order for them to open up and speak freely. The professor rationalized
that he was a very
well educated man and that his natural superiority was working wonders and
commanding respect among these uneducated lower class people.</p>
<p>"I would like to ask you how you view the social ramifications of being
an illegal alien in a country where you are unwanted?"</p>
<p>"In my homeland I lived in a village where most of the people have
always been poor. Even though we had little there was a strong bond among
all of us. In order to survive we were forced to work for a rich
landowner. It always seems that the rich are never satisfied with what
they have and always want more. The more that the rich have the less the
poor will have."</p>
<p>"When the landowner announced that he was cutting our pay, we decided
that we had no choice but to resist him. The landowner reacted with
violence from his armed thugs and then the government came to his aid,
calling us terrorists and bringing in the army."</p>
<p>"Many of us were arrested, including myself. We were taken to a prison
where we were tortured and those they thought were our leaders were never
seen again. After two years in prison, I was released and told that I
should never return to my village. I was told by relatives, in a near by
village, that my family had disappeared, as did many of the people of my
village, and that the landowner had brought in new poor people to work his
plantation. They told me that the army told them that I was on their list,
and if I returned to the region that not only would I be killed, but also,
my relatives would suffer the consequences. They told me that they would
continue to try to located my family and that I should head north."</p>
<p>"I made my way to the U.S. and worked in the fields as a farm worker
and later was able to work as a laborer on construction sites. At one
construction site a union rep. tipped off the INS agents and I was caught
in a raid. I was again held behind bars as if I was some type of
criminal."</p>
<p>"Knowing that if I was deported back to my country I faced the
possibility of being killed, so I told the agents that I came from Mexico
and was deported there."</p>
<p>"I made my way back to the U.S. and was more careful not to take jobs
that white Americans would want. I am illegal in my country and I am
illegal wherever I go. The better people look down on me as if I am some
type of inferior life form."</p>
<p>"My ancestors worked the land long before the rich landowners laid
claim to our land. That theft they called legal. The landowners exploited
my people and I, and that they called legal. When we tried to do something
about it we were arrested, tortured, disappeared and some murdered, and
that they called legal. I was forced to travel to a foreign land, hiding
out and taking whatever work I could. There I am treated like a criminal
and deported, and that they called legal. The rich are legal in most
everything they do, no matter how much harm they do. Since all those
things are legal, I am proud to be illegal, proud to be an outlaw, a
desperado. And I will continue to be such as long as the rich scum rule
our world. For as long as one class has more than they need there will be
another class that has less than they need."</p>
<p>"Some times the poor are called illegal for no other crime than just
being poor. But throughout the lands, from far and near, the desperados of
the world are a great number to behold, and the day will come when we
raise up together and pull the fangs of the rich vampires out of our necks
and end the days of them sucking our blood! And when our have gained the
power, the only ones to walk upon this earth as illegal with be the former
rich and their hired guns."</p>
<p>Those last words made the professor uneasy because he had always viewed
myself as being 'well off'.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
