<p>By Arthur J Miller</p>
<p>There are those that view working people as a uncultured mass of
laboring muscle This image is seen on tv, in movies, written in books and
taught by professors who view themselves as the authorities on labor. This
image has become a part of the market driven commodity called American
Culture. For those who take the time to look under the layers of
fabricated deceit, you will find working class culture. There among the
toiling masses you will find story tellers, poets, artists, song writers
and musicians. Their culture is not produced for the market place, but
rather it is an expression of their desires and lost dreams.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/cartoons/others/ownerdriver.jpg" align="right" />There
are some very unique characters out there, and I can honestly say I have
learn more from just sitting around listening to them, than I have ever
learned from reading books. One of the more interesting and tragic stiffs
I ever met was Old Fiddlin' Dan.</p>
<p>I had gone through truck driving school and had my CDL Class A License.
Trucking companies have their own training which starts off in a class
room and after you passed a bunch of tests, then they will send you out on
the road a trainer. My first trainer was a real ass who taught me very
little and went out of his way to make my life harder than it already
was.</p>
<p>One day we were heading west and he turned over the truck to me right
before we were to cross the Sierras. I started doing my pretrip
inspection, but the ass told me that we did not have time for it, because
he wanted to be across the mountains before dark. The ass also stated that
he only inspected the truck, at most, once a day. And just like an asses
fool, I went along with his foolishness.</p>
<p>Up the road I fell in line with other trucks at the Truckee inspection
station. After I was weighted, I was told to pull over to the inspection
bay. They found that the trailer brakes were out of lineament and a leak
in an airhose. We had to pay some weigh station vultures to get us legal,
for the law says that we cannot do it ourselves unless we are certified.
When we got back to our terminal I quit. There ain't no way I would put up
with that ass. And anyway, I did not want to learn my truckin' from an
ass.</p>
<p>I hooked up with another company and they sent me out with a trainer.
That trainer turned out to be Old Fiddlin' Dan. Now if you were just a
slacker who did not care about real learning, Old Dan could be a real
terror. On the other hand if you really wanted to learn about trucks and
truckin' there was no better teacher around.</p>
<p>On the second night out, Old Dan pulled into a high desert rest stop
and pulled out a beatup violin case. He told me that we were going to be
here a little while and to go out a stretch my legs. He jumped out of the
rig and walked over to a far corner of the rest stop. I watched him out of
curiosity as he stood close to the edge of a buff, looking out across the
land. It was dusk time and the sun was not long to be seen. After standing
there a while, he opened up his case and pulled out a fiddle. Now Old Dan
did not have the greatest fiddle technique my ears had ever heard. But he
played as if there was a real connection between him and his surroundings.
That is something that all the high class technique could never
produce.</p>
<p>I sat down and listen and watch him as the sun went down below the far
off mountains. It was one of those life experiences that will never leave
you. A gift, a treasure to hold on to until buried in a hole. And if the
spirit lives on in some way, then that experience was immortal.</p>
<p>When Dan came back to the truck he told me that I would take over
driving for a while. Unlike the ass, Dan insisted on a pretrip inspection
every time we changed drivers. He would say; "only trust another person
with your life when you have to." He would watch my inspection every time
I did one, not because he did not trust me, but because he did not have to
trust me.</p>
<p>After a hour or so of driving, I asked Dan about his fiddle playing. He
told me that he had started playing when he was young, but for a number of
years working, he just never had time for it. He had found that truck
driving was something that was hard to get away from, even when you are
not driving. It hangs on you like a dead weight upon your shoulders.
Things like watching tv or shooting the shit with other truckers just did
not relax him. So he said that he brought out his old fiddle and started
to play it when he needed a rest of both body and mind. He would pick some
of the nicest looking natural places to take his rest and then go out by
himself and just fiddle away.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he said, at special places, as the sun went down or came up
in the morning, he felt connected to everything around him. It was, to
him, almost a religious experience Even when he could not find that
special place, you might hear him fiddlin' away in some corner of a
truckstop. He told me that with his fiddle he was able to make peace with
himself for all that he had given up on the long hard road of
truckin'.</p>
<p>Old Dan was not a book learned socialist or any other kind of 'ist, he
just was able to see things without blinders that society installs upon
most people. He could think things through and come up with logical
conclusions. And most of the time, those conclusions were very close to my
learned radicalism. But coming from Dan it did not seem like an ideology,
it was plan old common sense.</p>
<p>He did not much care for the bosses. He called them vultures preying
upon the honest work of common folks. Nor did he care much for politicians
or the government, who he viewed as always sticking their noses into other
people's affairs. He talked about the day to come when common folks will
have taken all that they can and rid themselves of the bums and slackers
who make a living off the common folks. In a lot of ways he sound like
some of the old time Wobblies I had known.</p>
<p>Late one night driving the North Dakota road, we were listening to the
news on the radio which was telling about some Black workers suing their
boss because of discrimination. Old Dan gave out a loud yap and said "kick
that boss in the ass once for me!" That rather surprised me because Old
Dan was a southerner, he had come from the East Tennessee hill country. He
saw the look on my face then asked me if I was prejudice. I told him no.
He them when on to say, that "God had place all people on this earth and
that most all people worked hard for the same things. It was only the bums
and the slackers that try to get common folks hating each other. Common
folks must stick together or else the bums and slackers will have easier
prey."</p>
<p>Old Dan would often speak of his dream of owning his own truck and no
longer having a bum on his back. He said he was close to having the money
he needed for a down payment. In time he quit the company and got his
truck. He ran harder than he had ever done before to keep up the payments
on his truck and on his home where his family lived.</p>
<p>As is often the case of many working folks, fate don't seem to let them
escape to their dreams. Within a year Old Fiddlin' Dan suffered a stroke
and could not truck nor fiddle no more. The bank got his truck and home
and his family had to move out of their beloved Tennessee Hills to the
city. I was told by a friend that when Dan lost everything his lost his
will to live. After going to sleep one night Old Fiddlin' Dan never woke
up again. No matter what the doc said, Old Dan died of a broken heart.</p>
<p>Why do we live in a world where the dreams of the many are trampled
upon by the greed of a few bums and slackers? Did some God up high, degree
this as our fate so long ago? These things I just don't have an answer
for. All I know is that as long as the few want more than they can use,
the many will do without what the need. And our dreams are not a slackers
fantasies, they are a necessity of life itself. For what would the
existence of the toiler be worth without the dreams of something
better?</p>
<p>When ever I am out on the open road, I try to stop at some special
place. There I will just sit and listen. And I swear by all that is good,
I can almost hear a far off fiddle play as if that sound was a part of all
that is around me. Old Fiddlin' Dan was a hard working common man, but to
me he will always live on as a true working class saint.</p>
