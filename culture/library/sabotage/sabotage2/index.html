<p><img src="../../../../graphics/sabocats/sabcat_redgrey.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="224" width="215" />So it is with the quality.
Take the case of Frederic Sumner Boyd, in which we should all be
deeply interested because it is evident Frederic Sumner Boyd is
to be made "the goat" by the authorities in New Jersey. That is
to say, they want blood, they want one victim. If they can't get
anybody else they are determined they are going to get Boyd, in
order to serve a two-fold purpose to cow the workers of Paterson,
as they believe they can, and to put this thing, sabotage, into
the statutes, to make it an illegal thing to advocate or to
practice. Boyd said this: "If you go back to work and you find
scabs working alongside of you, you should put a little bit of
vinegar on the reed of the loom in order to prevent its
operation." They have arrested him under the statute forbidding
the advocacy of the destruction of property. He advised the dyers
to go into the dye houses and to use certain chemicals in the
dyeing of the silk that would tend to make that silk unweavable.
That sounded very terrible in the newspapers and very terrible in
the court of law. But what neither the newspapers nor the courts
of law have taken any cognizance of is that these chemicals
<i>are being used already</i> in the dyeing of the silk. It is
not a new thing that Boyd is advocating, it is something that is
being practiced in every dye house in the city of Paterson
already, but it is being practiced for the employer and not for
the worker.</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="dynamiting" name="dynamiting"></a>"Dynamiting" Silk</p>
<p>Let me give you a specific illustration of what I mean.
Seventy-five years ago when silk was woven into cloth the silk
skein was taken in the pure, dyed and woven, and when that piece
of silk was made it would last for 50 years. Your grandmother
could wear it as a wedding dress. Your mother could wear it as a
wedding dress. And then you, if you, woman reader, were fortunate
enough to have a chance to get married, could wear it as a
wedding dress also. But the silk that you buy today is not dyed
in the pure and woven into a strong and durable product. One
pound of silk goes into the dye house and usually as many as
three to fifteen pounds come out. That is to say, along with the
dyeing there is an extraneous and an unnecessary process of what
is very picturesquely called "dynamiting." They weight the silk.
They have solutions of tin, solutions of zinc, solutions of lead.
If you will read the journals of the Silk Association of America
you will find in there advice to master dyers as to which salts
are the most appropriate for weighting purposes. You will read
advertisements -- possibly you saw it reprinted in "The Masses"
for December, 1913 -- of silk mills, Ashley &amp; Bailey's in
Paterson, for instance, advertised by an auctioneer as having a
plant for weighting, for dynamiting silk par excellence. And so
when you buy a nice piece of silk today and have a dress made for
festive occasions, you hang it away in the wardrobe and when you
take it out it is cracked down the pleats and along the waist and
arms. And you believe that you have been terribly cheated by a
clerk. What is actually wrong is that you have paid for silk
where you have received old tin cans and zinc and lead and things
of that sort. You have a dress that is garnished with silk,
seasoned with silk, but a dress that is adulterated to the point
where, if it was adulterated just the slightest degree more, it
would fall to pieces entirely.</p>
<p>Now, what Frederic Sumner Boyd advocated to the silk workers
was in effect this: "You do for yourselves what you are already
doing for your employers. Put these same things into the silk for
yourself and your own purposes as you are putting in for the
employer's purposes." And I can't imagine -- even in a court of
law -- where they can find the fine thread of deviation -- where
the master dyers' sabotage is legal and the worker's sabotage
illegal, where the consist of identically the same thing and
where the silk remains intact. The silk is there. The loom is
there. There is no property destroyed by the process. The one
thing that is eliminated is the efficiency of the worker to cover
up this adulteration of the silk, to carry it just to the point
where it will weave and not be detected. <i>That</i> efficiency
is withdrawn. The veil is torn from off production in the
silk-dyeing houses and silk mills and the worker simply says,
"Here, I will take my hands off and I will show you what it is. I
will show you how rotten, how absolutely unusable the silk
actually is that they are passing off on the public at two and
three dollars a yard."</p>
<p class="redbar"><a id="adulteration" name="adulteration"></a>Non-Adulteration and
Over-Adulteration</p>
<p>Now, Boyd's form of sabotage was not the most dangerous form
of sabotage at that. If the judges had any imagination they would
know that Boyd's form of sabotage was pretty mild compared with
this: Suppose that he had said to the dyers in Paterson, to a
sufficient number of them that they could do it as a whole, so
that it would affect every dye house in Paterson: "Instead of
introducing these chemicals for adulteration, don't introduce
them at all. Take the lead, the zinc, and the tin and throw it
down the sewer and weave the silk, beautiful, pure, durable silk,
just as it is. Dye it pound for pound, hundred pound for hundred
pound." The employers would have been more hurt by that form of
sabotage than by what Boyd advocated. And they would probably
have wanted him put in jail for life instead of for seven years.
In other words, to advocate non-adulteration is a lot more
dangerous to capitalist interests than to advocate adulteration.
And non-adulteration is the highest form of sabotage in an
establishment like the dye houses of Paterson, bakeries,
confectioners, meat packing houses, restaurants, etc.</p>
<p>Interfering with quality, or durability, or the utility of a
product, might be illustrated as follows: Suppose a milkman comes
to your house every day and delivers a quart of milk and this
quart of milk is half water and they put some chalk in it and
some glue to thicken it. Then a milk driver goes on that round
who belongs to a union. The union strikes. And they don't win any
better conditions. Then they turn on the water faucet and they
let it run so that the mixture is four-fifths water and one-fifth
milk. You will send the "milk" back and make a complaint. At the
same time that you are making that complaint and refusing to use
the milk, hundreds and thousands of others will do the same
thing, and through striking at the interests of the consumer once
they are able to effect better conditions for thgemselves and
also they are able to compel the employers to give the pure
product. That form of sabotage is distinctly beneficial to the
consumer. Any exposure of adulteration, any over-adulteration
that makes the product unconsumable is a lot more beneficial to
the consumer than to have it tinctured and doctored so that you
can use it but so that it is destructive to your physical
condition at the same time.</p>
<p>Interfering with quality means, can be instanced in the hotel
and restaurant kitchens. I remember during the hotel workers
strike they used to tell us about the great cauldrons of soup
that stood there month in and month out without ever being
cleaned, that were covered with verdigris and with various other
forms of animal growth, and that very many times into this soup
would fall a mouse or a rat and he would be fished out and thrown
aside and the soup would be used just the same. Now, can anyone
say that if the workers in those restaurants, as a means of
striking at their employers, would take half a pound of salt and
throw it into that soup cauldron, you as a diner, or consumer,
wouldn't be a lot better off? It would be far better to have that
soup made unfit for consumption that to have it left in a state
where it can be consumed but where it is continually poisonous to
a greater or less degree. Destroying the utility of the goods
sometimes means a distinct benefit to the person who might
otherwise use the goods.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, sir", said the waiter. "It is the very best in the
city." That would be acting the good wage slave and looking out
for the employer's interest. But if the waiter should say, "No,
sir, it's rotten lobster salad. It's made from the pieces that
have been gathered together here for the last six weeks," that
would be the waiter who believed in sabotage, that would be the
waiter who had no interest in his boss' profits, the waiter who
didn't give a continental whether the boss sold lobster salad or
not.</p>
<p>And the judge would probably believe in sabotage in that
particular instance. The waiters in the city of New York were
only about 5,000 strong. Of these, about a thousand were
militant, were the kind that could be depended on in a strike.
And yet that little strike made more sensation in New York City
than 200,000 garment workers who were out at the same time. They
didn't win very much for themselves, because of their small
numbers, but they did win a good deal in demonstrating their
power to the employer to hurt his business. For instance, they
drew up affidavits and they told about every hotel and restaurant
in New York, the kitchen and the pantry conditions. They told
about how the butter on the little butter plates was sent back to
the kitchen and somebody with their fingers picked out cigar
ashes and the cigarette butts and the matches and threw the
butter back into the general supply. They told how the napkins
that had been on the table, used possibly by a man who had
consumption or syphillis, were used to wipe the dishes in the
pantry. They told stories that would make your stomach sick and
your hair almost turn white, of conditions in the Waldorf, the
Astor, the Belmont, all the great restaurants and hotels in New
York. And I found that that was one of the most effective ways of
reaching the public, because the "dear public" are never reached
through sympathy.</p>

<p>I was taken by a lady up to a West Side aristocratic club of
women who had nothing else to do, so they organized this club.
You know -- the white-gloved aristocracy! And I was asked to talk
about the hotel workers' strike. I knew that wasn't what they
wanted at all. They just wanted to look at what kind of person a
"labor agitator" was. But I saw a chance for publicity for the
strikers. I told them about the long hours in the hot kitchens;
about steaming, smoking ranges. I told them about the overwork
and the underpay of the waiters and how these waiters had to
depend upon the generosity or the drunkenness of some patron to
give them a big tip; all that sort of thing. And they were
stony-faced. It affected them as much as an arrow would
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>And then I started to tell them about what the waiters and the
cooks had told me of the kitchen conditions and I saw a look of
frozen horror on their faces immediately. They were interested
when I began to talk about something that affected their own
stomachs, where I never could have reached them through any
appeal for humanitarian purposes. Immediately they began to draw
up resolutions and to cancel engagements at these big hotels and
decided that their clubs must not meet there again. They caused
quite a commotion around some of the big hotels in New York.</p>
<p>When the workers went back to work after learning that this
was a way of getting at the boss via the public stomach they did
not hesitate at sabotage in the kitchens. If any of you have ever
got soup that was not fit to eat, that was too salty or peppery,
maybe there were some boys in the kitchen that wanted shorter
hours, and that was one way they notified the boss. In the Hotel
McAlpin the head waiter called the men up before him after the
strike was over and lost and said, "Boys, you can have what you
want, we will give you the hours, we will give you the wages, we
will give you everything, but, for God's sake, stop this sabotage
business in the kitchen!" In other words, what they had not been
able to win through the strike they were able to win by striking
at the taste of the public, by making the food non-consumable and
therefore compelling the boss to take cognizance of their
efficiency and their power in the kitchen.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
