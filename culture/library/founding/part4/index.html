<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>SECOND DAY</h2>
<h3>Wednesday, June 28</h3>
<h3>AFTERNOON SESSION</h3>
<p>The convention was called to order at 2 P.M.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: When the convention adjourned the status of
delegates was under discussion. Delegate Hagerty has the
floor.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I wish to call the attention of those who
have been discussing this question of representation to the
paragraph in the call for this convention which sets forth in
ummistakable terms the conditions upon which representation in
this gathering is to be based, to wit: &ldquo;Representation in
the convention shall be based upon the number of workers whom the
delegate represents. No delegate, however, shall be given
representation in the convention on the numerical basis of the
organization unless he has credentials bearing the seal of his
union, local, national or international and the signatures of the
officers thereof authorizing him to install his union as a
working part of the proposed economic organization in the
industrial department in which it logically belongs in the
general plan of organization. Lacking this authority, the
delegate shall represent himself as an individual.&rdquo; There
is some question only, as far as I can learn, in regard to the
interpretation of the last clause of that paragraph, namely,
&ldquo;Lacking this authority, the delegate shall represent
himself as an individual.&rdquo; One or two men with whom I have
talked seem to think that they can represent themselves as
individuals without binding themselves to become members of the
new economic organization. It strikes me that the simplest
intellectual honesty would permit of no other interpretation than
that the individual who takes part in the deliberations of this
convention should pledge himself to become a part of the proposed
revolutionary economic organization. If he does not so pledge
himself, then he is here under false pretenses. (Applause).</p>
<p>If he does not so pledge himself because of fear of losing his
daily wage, because of the pressure of the craft to which he
belongs, then certainly he ought to have no right to vote upon
these vital matters. Some arrangement, of course, may be made by
which he can become a member-at-large, and if conditions require
he may also remain in his craft; but it strikes me that this
representation on the numerical basis should be interpreted in
regard to those delegates here who may possibly give, by reason
of the delegated votes which they control, an appearance of
cesarism to this convention, which would be most undesirable, and
that this clause should be interpreted by the convention as
limiting these delegates to the actual number which they
represent.</p>
<p>DEL. ARNOLD: I am here representing 850 members of the
Journeyman Painters&rsquo; Union of Chicago. We were sent here
for the purpose of finding out what this convention is going to
do in the way of installing a new organization. We come here
dissatisfied with many things in the American Federation of
Labor. We would not be here if we were satisfied with the
American Federation of Labor; we would stay away from here. We
came to this convention to do all in our power to help this
movement along, and as representing this organization with power
to install our organization in this new movement. I am here to
find out and do all in my power to help the movement along. If
you don&rsquo;t allow individual delegates to take part in it,
what is the use of being here? Some men might be here for the
purpose of creating a political organization. Some men might be
here for the purpose of creating only an economic organization
and nothing else. We are here to find out what is going to be
done here. I know there are men here for political purposes. I
know it for I have seen it. There are men here that are for a
radical labor movement. That is what I am here for, not for
politics at all. If this movement is going to be a political
movement I will stay out of it. (Applause). If this movement is
going to be a trades union movement, as radical as can be, a
revolutionary movement with the intention to go out and fight
capital with all the power we have got, to fight capital to the
last and to keep politics out of it entirely, I promise right
here to be with you, and I will stay with you to the finish.
(Applause). I know there are delegates here from unions in
Chicago comprising 1,600 members. We have pretty near 3,000
painters represented here now; Over 2,500. Now, we are here to
see what this convention is going to do, and if you don&rsquo;t
allow us to have any voice or vote in this convention it is no
use to be here. I don&rsquo;t believe in individual delegates. I
believe we have got the interests of this movement at heart as
much as the individuals. We have an organization that has got
power to install, but it is not installed yet, but should have
more power than any individual delegates who have no power to be
installed. Suppose there are some delegates in here that have
power to install, and the convention turns out different than
they expected, do you think they would join this movement? I
think not. Up till now they are not a part of this organization;
they are not members of this movement until they are installed,
and they are not installed yet. There are none more than we are
entitled to be delegates, and I am sure that the delegates that
represent these unions that have power to act, if they find out
that it is not going their way they will withdraw and the
individual delegates can stay with you to the finish.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. LUCY E. PARSONS: A great deal has been said here about
the number of votes that the different delegates carry around in
their pockets. I am not here for the purpose of raising a note of
inharmony or disunion among these delegates. I am simply here in
the interest of truth as I see it. Now, this idea of mere force
of numbers sounds too much to me like &ldquo;Might makes
Right.&rdquo; Mere force of numbers never made a right on earth,
and, thanks to justice, never can. What is right, what is just
and justice, is simply the result of the best minds of all the
ages. Whatever right we have in society is simply a heritage
handed down to us by those who had only disinterested motives.
Now, I am one of those who entered my name as an individual
delegate. I had to do so because I had to subscribe to the
technicality of the clause that has been read by the delegate
before the last. I entered myself as an individual delegate, but
let me assure you that I for one had no such idea of entering my
name as an individual delegate. Now, a great many of you
represent your unions, and I certainly do believe in organized
labor or I would not be here; organization of a purely economic
nature. I entered my name believing that I did not represent a
mere body that met within the four walls of any hall, but that I
represent that great body that has its face to the foremost ends
of the earth. Now, I entered my name here, and I think others
did, because we had eyes to see misery, we had ears to hear the
cry of the downcast and miserable of the earth, we had a heart
that was sympathetic, and we believed that we could come here and
raise our voice and mingle it with yours in the interest of
humanity. So that is the great audience that I represent. I
represent those people, those little children who, after my
twenty-five years residence in Chicago, I know are in the
factories. I entered here as a delegate to represent that great
mass of outraged humanity, my sisters whom I can see in the night
when I go out in Chicago, who are young and fair and beautiful,
but who are compelled to sell the holy name of womanhood for a
night&rsquo;s lodging. I am here to raise my voice with them, and
ask you to put forth from this organization a declaration of
principles and a constitution that shall give them hope in the
future, that they shall be enrolled under the banner of this
organization. Had I simply come here to represent myself, I might
as well have remained at home and not taken up the time of your
deliberative body. Let me say to you&mdash;I will take but a few
moments of your time&mdash;that it matters not to me personally
what you shall finally decide. I am perfectly willing to leave my
case in the hands of this convention as to whether I and the rest
of the individual delegates shall be admitted. I wish simply to
say to you, God speed you in your effort, and that there might
come some good at least from your organization. I wish to state
in conclusion that some of the delegates seem to lay some capital
up or put some stress upon what some delegate or some people here
have lost in the interest of labor. Let me say to you that I
think that is the last stock in trade that any delegate should
talk about in this hall. It matters not if there is a man in this
hall who has lost a limb in the interest of labor, he has not
lived in vain. If there are some here who have lost their liberty
temporarily in the interest of labor, they have not spent their
time in vain. And if there are some who have lost their dearest
gift of all, life, in the interest of labor, that cause is
justified and their lives have not been sacrificed in vain. And
so let me say to you brothers and sisters, don&rsquo;t engage in
any personalities, but simply remember that we are here as one
brotherhood and one sisterhood, as one humanity, with a
responsibility to the down-trodden and the oppressed of all
humanity, it matters not under what flag or in what country they
happened to be born. Let us have that idea of Thomas Paine, that
&ldquo;The world is my country, and mankind are my
countrymen.&rdquo; (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A point of information. Is there any
question at all before the house to debar individuals as
delegates from voting at all, except such as have been objected
to by the Credentials Committee or by the convention?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: None at all. This motion does not bar any
delegates in this convention. The motion before the house is:
Moved and seconded that each delegation shall select a member of
each Committee named by the convention, and that the chair shall
appoint three other members from the individual representatives
to each committee.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: What is the original motion?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The original motion was made, I believe, by a
person on the floor who was not a delegate.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I beg your pardon; I was the man that made the
motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Are you a delegate?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I represent 1,600 painters.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What organization?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: No. 194 of the Painters and Decorators of
America.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The original motion was that each committee be
elected from the floor.</p>
<p>A delegate moved the previous question; no second.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: You appointed a Committee on Rules about half
past ten o&rsquo;clock, and then it seems you went on to
establish rules before that committee had a chance to make a
report on what they would recommend to the convention. Now you
are getting the cart before the horse again, and I think it would
have been a matter of courtesy to wait till they had time to
report and see what they were going to report, and then adopt the
report or reject it. You ought to have given the committee a
chance to make a report before you were so far ahead with your
work, and then if you wanted to quarrel over it do so. I desire
to make a report from that committee if you will allow me to do
it.</p>
<p>Previous question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The previous question has been called for.</p>
<p>DEL. NELSON: I am here as a delegate from No. 594, Painters of
Chicago. We represent 1,700 members. I want to know as to some
original delegates that claim to have been given power to install
their bodies, if it is nevertheless true that they were
instructed to report and a discussion to follow, and very likely
that will be the end of it. As long as we are classed as
individual delegates and not permitted to exercise the right to
move, I don&rsquo;t see what is the use of us being here. I would
like to know as a point of information whether delegates sent
from unions that you might say had instructions to investigate
and report are classed as individuals.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I would say in reply to that question that if
you are not prepared to install your organization you would be
classed as an individual delegate. The previous question has been
called for. Those in favor of the motion will signify it by the
voting sign. Contrary by the same sign. Gentlemen, you are voting
on the previous question. The motion is carried.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This is the substitute to the original motion
that committees be elected from the floor, and reads as follows:
The original motion is that committees be elected from the floor.
The substitute is that each delegation select a member on each
committee named by the convention and that the Chairman appoint
three additional members as individual representatives on each
committee. Those in favor of the substitute will signify it by
the voting sign of the convention. Contrary by the same sign. The
substitute is carried.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: Do I understand by that motion just now
passed that each committee shall be elected from the floor of the
convention?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, sir.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: What is it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The several delegations shall select a number of
each committee from their delegations, and the chair shall
appoint from the individual members three members on each
committee that may be chosen by this convention.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: Well, then, we have got to go back into
session again so as to fix our rules to suit yours. Sure we have.
We have got it all different from that here in this report. I
ain&rsquo;t going to report on anything of that kind. Will the
Committee on Rules of Order and Business step up on the platform
again?</p>
<p>After a short delay the Committee on Rules, through Delegate
Fairgrieve, made the following report:</p>
<p>RULES OF CONVENTION.</p>
<p>i. Three sessions shall be held daily, as follows: From 9.00
A. M. to 12.00 M.; from 2.00 P. M. to 6.00 P. M.; from 8.00 P. M.
to 9.30 P. M. (Note:&mdash;See amendment.)</p>
<p>2. The following standing committees shall be constituted: (a)
Constitution; (b) Resolutions; (c) Ways and Means; (d)
Literature.</p>
<p>3. All committees shall consist of one member of each
delegation named by the convention, and the chair to appoint to
each committee three members from the individual
representatives.</p>
<p>(Note by reporter:&mdash;In the original draft the portion on
committees was as follows: &ldquo;The Committee on Constitution
shall consist of eleven members and be elected by the convention.
4. All other committees shall consist of five members and be
appointed by the chairman.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>4. All motions shall be submitted in writing with name of
mover. (Note:&mdash;See amendment.)</p>
<p>5. On all general motions from the floor each speaker may
speak but five minutes, and no person shall speak twice on the
same subject until all others who desire have spoken.</p>
<p>6. In discussion of reports of committees and resolutions each
speaker may speak ten minutes, but no speaker shall speak twice
on the same subject until all others who wish shall have
spoken.</p>
<p>7. A person who has introduced a resolution may speak ten
minutes on his resolution when the same shall come before the
convention for action, with privilege of closing the debate.</p>
<p>8. Thursday, July 29 shall be devoted to a discussion of the
following topics, providing the standing committees shall first
have been selected: (a) Name of organization (b) tactics and
details; (c) first of May as International Labor Day; (d)
agreements vs. contracts; (e) international relations.
(Note:&mdash;See amendment as to Manifesto.)</p>
<p>9. Immediately after the adoption of the constitution shall
come, first, formal installation of unions and individuals into
the new organization; (b) election of permanent officers; (c)
selection of general headquarters; (d) selection of place and
date of next general convention.</p>
<p>10. On all points not covered by these rules, Robert&rsquo;s
Rules of Order shall be in force.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: In drawing up these rules we concluded that
we were here for business, and that our duty to the people who
sent us here is to devise ways and means to carry their work out,
so we have made the hours eight and a half instead of eight.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of the report of your
Committee on Rules. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: We discussed the matter of forming a
committee on Preamble and a declaration of principles, and we
thought it best to leave that with the Constitutional Committee,
because when they were constructing the constitution they would
know what to put in the Preamble and declaration of principles,
and the balance appertaining to it you people might change if you
wanted to.</p>
<p>DEL. SAINER: I move that this be taken up in detail and
discussed by the house. (Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A motion is made that this report be taken up in
detail and discussed by the house. You have heard the motion. Are
you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. WOLFE: I move that we adopt the report as read.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order, inasmuch as it
conflicts with the preceding motion.</p>
<p>DEL. WOLFE: It is an amendment to that motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: But you have just immediately before the report
of your Committee on Rules adopted a method by which we are going
to select committees. Now you must either re-consider that action
or you must make that conform to the report of your
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I move you that the report of the Committee on
Rules and Order of Business, that is that portion pertaining to
the committees, be so amended as to conform to the previous
action of this convention. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be accepted as an amendment. It has
been moved and seconded that the report of the committee be made
to conform with the action of the convention;&mdash;and that that
work be done by the committee?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: Well, that the report be so changed as to
conform to the action just had by the convention in the make-up
of committees. In place of saying seven members, have it read
that it is made up in accordance with the motion that was just
carried.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I would like to make a motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There is a motion before the house and an
amendment to the motion.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I wish to make an amendment to the amendment, to
strike out all after the third section naming the committees, and
insert these words: &ldquo;The committees to be elected by the
various delegations as previously provided, and with the three
individual members likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is the sense of this amendment, to include
that. The original motion is that the report of this committee be
taken up in detail and discussed by the convention. The amendment
is that the report of the committee be accepted and made to
conform with the action of the convention. The amendment is
before the convention. Brother McDonald has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: I think the original motion made for the
adoption of the report of the committee is the proper motion to
be made by this convention and discussed by this convention. You
are acting upon the report of the committee. This convention is
not prepared to adopt the report of the committee, but this
convention has the right to move the acceptance of the report of
the committee, and then that report of the committee becomes the
property of this convention, and then this convention changes
anything in the report that is not in accordance with the wishes
of the convention. That is the only way that I see that the
report of the committee can properly be disposed of. A motion to
accept the report of the committee does not adopt the report of
the committee; it simply makes the report of the committee the
property of this convention; it gives this convention material to
work with, you understand. Then this committee can change the
report of the committee to suit and in conformity with the action
already taken by this convention. If that is not done, then it
would be impossible for us to amend or change, annul or modify
any suggestion made by the report of the committee. It seems to
me that is the only proper way that the proposition can be
handled. The idea of making motions to receive the report of the
committee and adopt the report of the committee in conformity
with something that has already been done, is simply going to
tangle the convention in such a manner that the convention can
spend all the afternoon in doing nothing but unraveling the
entanglements. By taking up every suggestion made by the
committee separately, the convention can dispose of the matter
promptly and intelligently and to the satisfaction of every
member or of the majority of the members of this convention.
Without that is done it would be absolutely impossible for you to
change any suggestion that is made in the report of the
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. KERRIGAN: I move that the committee&rsquo;s report be
accepted.</p>
<p>Motion declared out of order by delegates.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: To expedite matters, it seems that the last
motion carried in regard to the forming of committees, and as
long as no delegate is opposed to the rest of the report of this
committee, it seems to me that the motion to adopt the report,
amending it so as to conform with the former action, would be the
proper course to pursue. Therefore, I think it would be in order
for any delegate opposed to this motion to get up and make his
objections to the different parts or any part that he sees
objection to in this report. Otherwise, it seems to me the best
method to pursue would be to adopt that motion whereby it was
amended to cover the last action.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I believe the suggestion I made would bring the
report before the convention and have the convention act seriatim
on that proposition. Otherwise you cannot do it. I am satisfied
if this convention desires to act seriatim on the report of the
committee.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I simply want to ask for a point of information.
The motion before the house, Del. Sullivan&rsquo;s motion, is to
make the report conform with the action of the convention and
then adopt the rest. Do you hold that no other part of that
report could be changed?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I would not so hold, no. I hold that the report
of the committee is still in the hands of the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Even if Delegate Sullivan&rsquo;s motion is
carried?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Sullivan&rsquo;s motion is that the
report of the committee be accepted and that it be made to
conform to the previous action of the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Let me ask through you what Delegate Sullivan
thinks about it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Isn&rsquo;t that your notion, Brother
Sullivan?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: My intent was to amend the report of the
Committee on Rules as to conform with the action that was
previously had in the formation of the committees. It does not
carry with it the adoption of the amended report if it is so
amended. It would simply change that where it says that the
Constitution Committee shall be seven, and cause it to be formed
as provided for in the previous motion.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then you don&rsquo;t mean to adopt the
committee&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: It should say that that would require another
action on the report, to adopt the report.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then wouldn&rsquo;t it be best to take it up
seriatim at the beginning and act on every rule? We are simply
getting this all mixed up. The only reason I asked that question
is that I wanted to amend two of the rules.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to do that.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: Brother Coates, the convention has by its
action said how the committees shall be formulated. The Committee
on Rules and Order of Business has submitted a report stating how
the committees shall be formulated. Now, the convention is the
creator of this committee, and it has spoken. I want to make this
report read in conformity with the action which we have had.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: Then if there are other objections to the
report, take them up.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to do that, but let us do it when we get
it in the report. Let us not mix the thing up. Let us act first
on Rule No. 1, dispose of the matter and know what we want. I
think that is the only proper way to do.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment is that the report of the
committee be accepted and made to conform with the previous
action of the convention. Those in favor of the amendment will
signify it by the voting sign. Contrary by the same sign. The
amendment is lost. The original motion is that the report of the
committee be taken up seriatim. Those in favor of the motion will
signify it by the voting sign. Contrary by the same sign. The
motion is carried. The Secretary will please read.</p>
<p>Secretary White read the next rule, as follows: &ldquo;Three
sessions shall be held daily, as follows: From 9 A. M. to 12 M.;
from 2 P. M. to 6 P. M.; from 8 P. M. to 9.30 P. M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A delegate moved the adoption of the rule.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to offer an amendment to the motion, and
that is that the section be stricken out. Mr. Chairman, I do that
for this reason. I well remember the statement of the member of
that committee who made the report, that we are here in the
interest of the people who sent us, and we ought to cut out the
theatres and so on. I want to say this, that a good part of the
work of this convention in the next few days is going to devolve
upon the committees of this convention, and I am opposed to the
committees working while the convention is in session. We have
provided for something like half a dozen committees, as I
understand the report, and half a dozen times twenty will take a
great body from this convention. I do not believe, Mr. Chairman
and fellow delegates, that we ought to sit here from 9
o&rsquo;clock in the morning to 12, from 2 o&rsquo;clock till 6,
and from 8 o&rsquo;clock till 9.30, and then expect the
committees to work from 9.30 till 9 o&rsquo;clock the next
morning. I do not think that is fair, I do not think it is just,
I do not think it will expedite the business of this convention,
and I move that that be stricken out. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: A question of information. I would like to ask
if it is correct for any one to make a motion and then proceed to
argue it before it is even seconded and put to the body.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Cut my argument out.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I will state for the benefit of the delegate
here (Delegate Saunders) that Delegate Coates has not said a
word. (Laughter). The motion is that that section be stricken
out. Are you ready for the question? (Question called for). Those
in favor of the motion will signify it by saying aye. Contrary
no. The motion is carried. Now a motion would be in order to
adopt Rule one as amended.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I make a motion that this rule be adopted as
amended. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is regularly moved and seconded that clause
one be adopted as amended. Are you ready for the question?
(Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: I move to amend that we strike out &ldquo;9 A.
M.&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;8 A. M.&rdquo; for the morning
session. (Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. SUNAGEL: That is out of order. When a motion is before
the house, is it in order to amend something?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion has not been placed before the house.
The question before the house is the adoption of Rule one as
amended. Before any other amendment can be offered it will be
necessary to vote this down.</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: We have just stricken out the section. According to
the report of the committee our morning sessions begin at 9 A. M.
and the afternoon sessions run from 2 to 6 P. M., making seven
hours a day, not including the night session. I should judge by
the progress that this convention has made that we are going to
be compelled to remain here for several days. This is very
valuable time to some of the organizations represented at this
convention. We are delegates from the American Flint Glass
Workers&rsquo; Union. July 10 we meet in annual convention in
Martin&rsquo;s Ferry, Ohio. If the work of this convention is to
be dragged on until a late day it will simply be impossible for
the representatives from the American Flint Glass Workers&rsquo;
Union to remain over.</p>
<p>We want to stay here if possible until this convention
completes its work, but if we are going to continue moving with
this snaillike progress it will be impossible for us to stay. I
consider from 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning till 12 noon and
from 2 o&rsquo;clock till 6 P. M. is no unreasonable hours for us
to serve in this convention, and I believe that every delegate
here to-day that has the proletarian cause at heart won&rsquo;t
object or hesitate to agree to remain in this hall eight hours a
day for the purpose of completing the work of placing this
organization on a proper and substantial foundation. My remarks
regarding the valuable time may appear strange to those who have
ample time to remain here, but I want you to consider this one
important fact: We are laying the foundation for a new industrial
organization, and in laying that foundation we want to be sure
that we lay it right. Those who are sympathetic with this
movement do not want to be discouraged. The American Flint Glass
Workers&rsquo; Union, by a vote of two to one, voted to send
representatives to this convention, and all we need is a little
more light and a little clearness on this matter, and I promise
you the American Flint Glass Workers&rsquo; Union will form
itself one part of this new industrial body. (Applause). I hope
you will consider our time. We have got an enormous amount of
work to perform in the succeeding week in order to get ready for
our national convention, and you members of labor organizations
who have prepared for annual conventions such as we are compelled
to prepare far, I am sure you will appreciate the magnitude of
the work that we have got to perform during the ensuing week. I
hope you will consider our position in this matter and change
that rule to read from 8 to 12 and from 2 to 6, in order that we
may be able to complete our work just as hastily and as
successfully as we can possibly do it.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: The Committee on Credentials desire to make a
report.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question before the convention is the
adoption of Rule one as amended. Those in favor will signify it
by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is lost.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I make an amendment to make the sessions from 8
o&rsquo;clock A. M. to 12 M.; recess from 12 till 2; session from
2 P. M. to 6 P. M. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: I move that we amend that rule to read from 8 A. M.
to 12 M. and from 2 to 6 P. M. for our daylight sessions.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>Del. Sherman: I make an amendment as follows: &ldquo;Sessions
will convene at 9 A. M. and continue until 12 o&rsquo;clock;
reconvene at one o&rsquo;clock and adjourn at 6
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; (Seconded.)</p>
<p>Del. Rowe: Any way so we can put in eight hours. I am
satisfied to begin at 9</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the motion. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for). Those in favor of having the
sessions from A. M. till 12 and from 1 till 6, will signify it by
saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Committee on Credentials have a report to
make. Are you willing to listen to it at this time or do you wish
to proceed with the report of the Committee on Rules?</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Is the first rule adopted as amended?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The first rule has been defeated, and an
amendment to the rule adopted.</p>
<h4>REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALS.</h4>
<p>Del. White, of the committee: There has been no vote taken on
that, and I want to say that there are delegates entitled to
seats in this convention, and the committee is ready to report to
this convention. It only takes a minute, and I believe those
delegates are entitled to seats in this convention as much as any
other men.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Unless a motion is made now to listen to the
report of the Committee on Credentials, we will proceed with the
report of the Committee on Rules.</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the convention proceed with the
report of the Committee on Credentials. Motion carried.</p>
<p>The Committee on Credentials, through Secretary White, made
the following report:</p>
<p>In the case of the coal miners from Illinois whose status was
contested and protest filed against, the committee asked every
one of them whether they were believers in the Manifesto. Every
one of them stated that they are firm believers in the Manifesto,
and the committee could only be guided by the provisions of the
Manifesto, which provide that all wage earners who believe in
those principles are eligible to a seat. The Committee on
Credentials could not go back to see what happened a year or two
or four days ago, when those men said that they are believers in
the Manifesto. Therefore, the Committee on Credentials recommend
that these five men, against whom a protest was filed, be seated
with one vote each.</p>
<p>In the case of C. B. Boudin, the attorney from New York, who
also claims that he writes for different papers, a protest was
filed, and the committee after inquiring of him found that he was
also a &ldquo;friend and sympathizer&rdquo; of labor. Your
committee recommends him as a fraternal delegate to this
convention.</p>
<p>Your committee further reports and recommends that Robert
Rives LaMonte be seated as a delegate with one vote.</p>
<p>The committee recommends that Charles Shuler, delegate from
the Amalgamated Glass Workers, No. 1, Chicago, Ill., be seated
with one vote.</p>
<p>Also Pat O&rsquo;Neil, Neelly, Ark., one vote.</p>
<p>Also W. Harry Spears. Chicago, one vote.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN:&mdash;You have heard the report of the
committee. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS, CHICAGO: I move that the report be received and
concurred in, except in that part stating that the attorney was a
friend of labor. I move that that part be stricken out and be not
concurred in, and that he be not seated. (Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the motion. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>MR. BOUDIN: I am the attorney referred to.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: A point of order. We are in a delegate body
here.</p>
<p>MR. BOUDIN: I know. I was the individual, and I was
misrepresented by being called a &ldquo;friend of labor.&rdquo; I
am not a friend of labor; I have been in the labor movement for
the last fourteen years.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: Question.</p>
<p>MR. BOUDIN: I ask for the floor:</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You are not entitled to the floor until your
case is disposed of.</p>
<p>MR. BOUDIN: It seems to me that the delegates ought to know
the case.</p>
<p>DEL. W. T. HALL: I move that the delegate&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There is a motion already before the convention,
and that is that the report of the committee be concurred in with
the exception of that part that refers to the attorney. Are you
ready for the question? (Question called for). Delegate Hall has
the floor.</p>
<p>Delegate Hall arose.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;BRIEN: I think the gentleman is entitled to a
seat if he is a sincere supporter of the cause of the working
class. He has a brother in a prominent position in one of the
strongest international unions. I have information that he is a
correspondent for certain international labor papers, and I
believe that the showing entitles him to be a delegate here. Our
general antipathy and hatred to attorneys would not offer any
good reason in this matter.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I do not know the gentleman in question at all.
I haven&rsquo;t anything against him whatsoever as a man, but J
believe that this convention here is for the purpose of
inaugurating an organization built on better lines than previous
organizations of its kind have been built on. I believe the first
lesson should be taught by the working class of America proving
themselves to be able to successfully inaugurate a
movement&mdash;and I suppose it will be teaching for the first
time in the history of America that a trades union shall be
composed of workingmen or wage earners (applause) and that we are
ready and that we may be ready at any time to accept assistance
from any &ldquo;friends of labor&rdquo;&mdash;but from the
outside. (Applause). I do believe that this is a question which,
if it is voted in the negative and we admit this attorney, simply
will open the door for some other attorneys that are not so
friendly. Therefore, I believe that if this attorney is sincere
in his friendship, he will not force us to accept him.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: As Secretary of the Committee on Credentials, I
want to say that I forgot to read the name of D: Burgess, who was
passed on by the committee last night. The committee recommend
that this man he given one vote and a seat in the convention.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Has the mover of the motion any objection to
adding the name of D. Burgess?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: Who is he? What is his vocation?</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: A metal worker.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: No. I accept that addition.</p>
<p>DEL. MRS. LILIAN FORBERG: Comrade Chairman and Fellow
Delegates: I want to speak just a few words in support of the
motion that says that we should not accept an attorney at law as
a delegate in this convention. This is the first convention, to
my knowledge, that has ever been called to organize the working
class into an organization by which they can fight the capitalist
class. The only thing that an attorney ever did in this world was
to support the capitalist class. (Applause). The only way in
which attorneys at law ever express their friendship to the
working class is by fighting for injunctions before the courts of
law against the working class. (Applause). I think it is a
well-known fact that no attorney at law could be anything else
but a parasite. We are here to fight the whole parasitical class
and to organize the working class. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SCHWARTZ: As I understood, this convention is to organize
all men who work for wages, all men who are employed at anything
in any line of work, clerks or cashiers, anybody who is working.
What we mean to exclude from this convention are those who live
on interest or profit where somebody else works for them. But
where somebody else lives and personally does any work, either is
a judge or a lawyer at the bar, he is under the present system
the same as those men who are toiling at other work: and because
he has chosen that work he was forced to it, and he has just the
same right, I maintain, to be admitted in this convention. This
gentleman at heart is just as honest and true as that of any
other man who works in any industry, I claim. The fact that he is
here shows that he has spent his own money to defend our cause. I
know him, and I tell you that he would never take a case against
any workingmen to crush them down. For that reason I claim that
he ought to be admitted in this convention.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: As I was the one who brought the protest against
this applicant, I ask the courtesy of the floor for a moment. I
would not have asked for the floor if it had not been that some
would think it necessary to offer a reason for my opposition. I
recognize all that is at stake in this movement, and I am sorry
that I have to take up time with a thing of this sort, but I
consider that when I go home I have to report to a constituency;
and I cannot stand before the looking glass and report to myself,
not being an individual delegate here, and I cannot allow this
thing to go by without expressing myself in the interest of my
constituency. I greatly regret the language of the last speaker
who brought in the personal equation of the individual in
question. I hope the question will he kept upon that field upon
which it was placed by the mover of the motion and by the lady
who supported him. The gentleman who spoke last sought to place
himself upon principle when he said that any one who works and
does not derive interest or profit is admissible to this body. I
consider that to be a serious error. Not only must we exclude
people who are themselves living on interest that they draw
directly, but we must exclude those who live as parasites upon
those who draw interest. (Applause). If you admit a lawyer
because he nominally works and does not derive interest though
every dollar that goes into his pocket is tainted with the blood
of workingmen in some way or other, because he lives upon
interest indirectly&mdash;if you allow such a man in here, by
what process of reasoning can you exclude the detective? By what
process of reasoning can you exclude the policeman? By what
process of reasoning can you exclude many a fellow whom I would
sooner receive in a body of this sort than a lawyer? (Applause).
I hope the gentlemen of the committee will give me credit for
having abstained from going into the personal character of this
applicant. I shall therefore not now cross the praise bestowed
upon the applicant by the gentleman who spoke last. If I were to
cross him, as I could, I would introduce the question; I prefer
not to have this thing settled by that method; if this man is
accepted or rejected upon his character, the principle would not
be established. He is of importance to me only on account of the
principle by which he seeks admission here. I consider that a
lawyer is a parasite upon parasites, and that as we are opposed
to parasitism we must decapitate the lawyer from our ranks.
(Applause). I have had experience with this man. I have known men
for whom at one time I had friendship, but I found it necessary
to break with them because the breath of their nostrils is a
crime upon society. (Applause). I would say that I know no lawyer
who deserves any place in the labor movement. Are we standing
upon the class struggle? Shall we denounce in one corner of our
mouths that which we by our votes approve of in the other corner?
What does the class struggle mean but that the material
necessities of a man control his action? And will you deny that
the material necessities of the lawyer will compel him to commit
the crimes against the working class that every lawyer in the
country commits to-day? (Applause). For these reasons I abstain
from going into the character of the man, and I hope that he will
be excluded absolutely and with no fraternal seat. If he or any
other lawyer is a decent man, if he or any other lawyer really
stands upon the principles of the class struggle, if he or any
other lawyer realizes the necessities of the movement, he would
himself vote for this motion. I would, therefore, think that if
this man&rsquo;s friends believe him to be decent, they should
urge him to withdraw before an opportunity was given for a vote;
his application for admission here does in itself stand upon a
wrong foundation. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. MCEACHREN: I hold that this convention of workingmen and
women cannot do other than exclude this man who has applied for
admission and has given his vocation as that of a lawyer. I
believe that this organization that we are to form, which is
going to be based as we hope upon the lines of the class
struggle, cannot by any process of reasoning admit this
individual, whether he claims to be a friend of labor or not; for
the man or the individual that would insist and appeal to this
convention for a seat on the ground that he is a friend of labor,
by the very fact that he does that, disproves his position as
being a friend of labor. (Applause). That is about all that I
have to say. As to the man&rsquo;s character, I care not what it
is. His character may be vastly superior to that of many
workingmen who will join and belong to this organization. The
man&rsquo;s character is not in question, but the lines of the
class struggle organization. The S. T. &amp; L. A., which has
made this main protest [line missing from original transcript]
are in question, and I hope you will not obscure them.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>Question called for in many parts of the hall.</p>
<p>DEL. A. M. SIMONS: I want this convention to understand the
sincerity of the objections which have been made by the men that
have spoken with regard to the position of lawyers within this
or[line missing from original transcript] not only admits lawyers
to its organization, but had this particular man not only as a
member, but a member of their national executive board.</p>
<p>Confusion in the hall, and cries of &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A point of order&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I have got the floor.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You will not be permitted to go on that way,
brothers.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMON: Are we to permit those men to pour their vomit on
us? Will we sit here quietly and stand for this?</p>
<p>Cries of &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I ask the convention are we to stand for this or
not? I am simply stating a fact on the floor.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question before the convention is a motion
that we concur in the report of the Credentials Committee with
the exception of that portion of it that refers to attorneys.
Now, delegates, in the discussion, notwithstanding what may have
preceded&mdash;and I have not heard any personalities against
this brother who asks to be a delegate&mdash;we will cut out all
personalities and confine the debate to the question at
issue.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I am very glad to accept that. May we not take
that then as a precedent, that from now on all personalities will
be kept out of these discussions? If so, no man will yield
quicker to it than I.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: They must yield.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: If that is true, all right. Then I want to say
this: With the principle that attorneys are to be excluded from
this convention, with the principle that they are to be excluded
from the organization that is to be formed, I am in accord, and I
have no desire to get upon the floor except for the purpose for
which I was up here before. But I felt that the attempt to draw
the same line that has been drawn here, to draw the line on a man
because of his occupation, is something that we cannot respect.
We have got to make up our minds here that the man who comes and
brings with him a determination to work for and support this
organization, that that man must be taken at his word here until
he proves to be false. But we don&rsquo;t want to go back into
the records. We don&rsquo;t want to drag up those matters. If we
do we shall find that it is a sword that cuts both ways. I want
to object to that sort of work, and I am glad of your ruling.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: This convention is called for the purpose of
bringing about more harmony in the ranks of labor, and it is not
fair before a convention of workingmen to get up and quarrel over
whether or not one particular individual ought to be kept out or
not. We must proceed upon our knowledge of what this movement
consists in. We cannot say that one particular individual in
society does not belong to the working class or capitalist class.
We must take certain central characteristics of the system and
proceed from them outward. I know of lawyers and politicians that
would come into this movement and bring it to ruin. We have come
here to see that the working class controls the working class
movement. If that is to be the central characteristic of this
movement, let us set a precedent. If any one who belongs to the
class that is the enemy of the working class movement persists
and insists on coming in here, if he is so great a friend, let
him show his friendship by getting up and declining.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Let it be understood that the report of your
Credentials Committee does not confer a vote on this delegate. He
will be a fraternal delegate only, and not with a vote. The
motion is that the report of the committee be adopted with the
exception of that portion that refers to the attorney. Are you
ready for the question? (Question called for). Those in favor
will signify it by saying aye. Contrary, no. The ayes seem to
have it. The motion is adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I understand it is parliamentary practice after
a motion is carried to make a personal explanation. It has been
said that this Boudin as a lawyer was a member of the Socialist
Trade &amp; Labor Alliance. I wish to say that there is no truth
in that statement.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is not necessary. There is nothing before the
convention.</p>
<h4>REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RULES.</h4>
<p>Following disposition of the report of the Committee on
Credentials, consideration of the report of the Committee on
Rules was resumed.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman, is a motion in order?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, the matter before the house is the report of
the Committee on Rules of Order.</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann, reading report: &ldquo;The following
standing committees shall be constituted: (a) Constitution; (b)
Resolutions; (c) Ways and Means; (d) Literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the report of the Committee on
Rules. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I move that a Committee on Organization be added
to those. (Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the motion. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for). It is moved and seconded that a
Committee on Organization be added to the number of committees
provided for by the report of the committees. Those in favor of
the motion will signify it by the voting sign. Contrary by the
same sign. The motion is carried. Are you ready for the report of
the committee as amended?</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: I move that that paragraph be adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I move that the report be adopted as amended.
(Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;BRIEN: I move that the Committee on Literature
act as a Press and Literature Committee. That is a very important
committee. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is moved that the Committee on Literature act
as a Press and Literature Committee. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>The question was called for, and being put, the motion was
carried.</p>
<p>The motion to adopt the report of the committee as amended was
then put and carried.</p>
<p>Here the Chairman called Delegate Coates to the chair, to
preside in the absence of Chairman Haywood.</p>
<p>SECRETARY TRAUTMANN, reading: &ldquo;The Committee on
Constitution shall consist of eleven members and be elected by
the convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: That was amended by the convention. In
reading I inserted the change.</p>
<p>SECRETARY TRAUTMANN: I know.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will proceed with the reading.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: We have to change Article 3 to conform with the
action of the convention.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It does not seem to the chair that that will be
necessary. All referring to how it shall be appointed should be
stricken out. The convention has already decided the method.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: A point of information. Does that mean that there
will be three and the chair will appoint one, making four on each
committee?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, sir. There will be one person from each
delegation, making something like twenty on each committee.</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann continued the reading of the report, as
follows: &ldquo;All motions shall be submitted in writing, with
name of mover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is the pleasure of the convention on this
rule?</p>
<p>It was moved that the rule be adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I move that this rule be stricken out. (Motion
seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I am in favor of the motion, but the way the
motion reads there it will simply take in every motion. It does
not specify there, and consequently it would make an endless
chain. I understand that certain brothers wanted to get away to
certain conventions, and therefore I move to lay on the table.
(Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. GUY MILLER: I move to amend that at the request of the
Chairman all motions shall be submitted in writing, accompanied
by the name of the mover. (Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegate makes an amendment that at the
request of the chair all motions shall be submitted by the mover
in writing. Any remarks on the motion? If not, all those in favor
of the motion will say aye. Contrary no. The amendment is
adopted.</p>
<p>The next section of the rules was read, as follows: &ldquo;On
general motions from the floor each speaker may speak for five
minutes, and no speaker shall speak twice on the same subject
until all others who desire have spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Del. Saunders moved the adoption of the rule. Seconded and
carried.</p>
<p>The next section was read, as follows: &ldquo;6. In
discussions of reports of Committee on Resolutions each speaker
may speak ten minutes, but no speaker shall speak twice on the
same subject until all others who wish shall have
spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the section be adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I move to amend to make it five minutes.
(Amendment seconded.)</p>
<p>The amendment being put, was lost, and the rule as reported
was adopted.</p>
<p>The next rule was read, as follows: &ldquo;A person who has
introduced a resolution may speak ten minutes on his resolution
when the same shall come before the convention for action, with
privilege of closing the debate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On motion duly seconded, the rule was adopted.</p>
<p>The next rule was read, as follows: &ldquo;Thursday, June 29,
shall be devoted to a discussion of the following topics,
providing the standing committees shall first have been selected:
(a) Name of organization; (b) tactics and details; (c) First of
May as international labor day; (d) agreements vs. contracts; (e)
international relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I would like to know what became of the
proposition of having some of the members, of the original
conferees, state the reason for the Manifesto. What became of
that? Has that been abolished?</p>
<p>DEL. TRAUTMANN: That has been suggested to the committee, but
the committee has not found it necessary to embody it.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I believe it was the intention to have that
part inserted in there.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If there is no objection let it be added to the
report that if this is adopted it shall include a history of this
movement. I think that it includes that.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: The reasons for the Manifesto, then, precede
that special order of business?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes. First the reasons for this movement and the
practical conditions that bring this condition about. That should
be added.</p>
<p>Del. Rowe: I move its adoption as read. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Is that to adopt the whole report of the
committee?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, it is only that that section be adopted. Are
there any remarks? If not, those in favor will say aye. Contrary
no. It is so adopted.</p>
<p>Delegate Trautmann continued the reading of the report, as
follows: &ldquo;Immediately after the adoption of the.
constitution shall come, first, formal installation of unions and
individuals into the new organization; (b) election of permanent
officers; (c) selection of general headquarters; (d) selection of
place and date of next general convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is your pleasure on this rule?</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the rule be adopted. Motion
carried.</p>
<p>The next rule was read, as follows: &ldquo;On all points not
covered by these rules, Robert&rsquo;s Rules of Order shall be in
force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the rule be adopted. Motion
carried.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: Mr. Chairman, I have been intending since
noontime to draw the attention of the chair to a matter that was
drawn to my attention at noontime, that in this body seated
around among the delegates there were persons who are not
delegates, and I was told that some of them even voted, and it
was suggested that there be some method of separating the actual
delegates from visitors or persons who may be amongst us. The
convention is organized. When it was organized we gave all
delegates who are actual delegates seats along the tables in the
body of the hall, and let those who are visitors, who came in to
look on what is going on here, separate themselves so that when a
vote is taken we will know that nobody is voting or raising a
hand when a vote is taken that is not entitled to vote in this
convention. I move that that request be made of all those not
regularly seated as delegates. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I move that we proceed at once to distribute the
badges to those who are entitled to them, and in that way we
shall know who they are.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Let the chair explain. The committee has not yet
got its work perfected, and just as soon as it has, which will
likely he to-morrow morning, each delegate will be given a badge
and we will settle that matter then. I want to say to all
visitors in this hall that the position of the present chairman
will be this: that all visitors in this convention are welcome to
the gallery. As far as possible we will exclude visitors entirely
from the lower floor. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I think there are only a few here, and when we
have the badges it will not be necessary to exclude them.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I will ask at least that no visitors occupy
seats at the tables.</p>
<p>(Here the visitors retired to the gallery.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will proceed.</p>
<p>The next section was read, as follows: &ldquo;Order of
business: Calling to order; roll call of delegates; reading of
minutes; reading of communications; report of Credential
Committee and seating of new delegates; reports of special
committees; report of standing committees in the following order:
Constitution, Resolutions, Ways and Means, Literature; unfinished
business; new business; adjournment.&rdquo; (Signed by the
committee.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is your pleasure as to this order of
business?</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that it be adopted.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I move that a Committee on Organization be
provided for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That was already included. Are there any remarks
on the motion to adopt this rule?</p>
<p>There being no remarks, the motion to adopt was put and
carried.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will read the report of the
Committee on Rules as amended and adopted, by sections, so that
if there are any errors they can be corrected.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I move you that we now adopt the rules or report
of the Committee on Rules as a whole.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I asked him to read it before you made that
motion.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: All right.</p>
<p>The report of the Committee on Rules, as amended, was then
read by the Secretary, as a whole.</p>
<p>A delegate asked if the Press Committee was included in the
report. The Chairman replied that the Press and Literature
Committee was in there.</p>
<p>The delegate called attention to the importance of the Press
Committee, in view of reports that had appeared in the Chicago
papers in regard to this convention, and requested that no
delegates but members of the Press Committee give any information
to newspaper reporters.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I can only say that the convention is wide open
to anybody and everybody to hear the proceedings until you act
otherwise, but I want to say to any reporters that they are very
uncomfortable down there taking notes (indicating the back end of
the hall). I would be very glad to have you up in front. Is there
a motion to adopt the report of the committee as amended?</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the report as a whole as
amended be adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. KERRIGAN: A point strikes me, that five minutes might not
be enough to enable a point to be clearly explained. Now, could
additional time be given to delegate by somebody, who would be
interested enough in having the matter cleared up, or could we
amend the rules to that effect?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If you ask the question of the chair, I would
say this, that no man can give away the time of this convention.
It is not his time to give away, in the first place.</p>
<p>DEL. KERRIGAN: Well, it is his to that extent; it is his to
the extent of five minutes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I am satisfied that just as soon as any delegate
completes his five minutes a vote of the convention will be
necessary, and all that will be necessary, to extend his
time.</p>
<p>DEL. KERRIGAN: That can be accomplished in that way?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, I should think so.</p>
<p>The question was called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is to adopt the report of the
committee as a whole as amended. All those in favor of the motion
will say aye. Contrary no. It is so adopted. Before we get away
from this report I want to impress upon the minds of the
delegates the fact that you have just adopted a rule which sets
aside practically the entire day to-morrow to the discussion of
various topics relative to the organization, its features, name,
and so on. I trust that all delegates will come prepared to
discuss those things at that time, and get through with them just
as promptly as possible. Practically no other business will be
entertained, I should judge from this rule adopted, until that
has been disposed of tomorrow.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I move that the Secretary take steps to have a
sufficient number of copies of the rules prepared by mimeograph
or otherwise, so that each delegate can have a copy.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Of the entire rules?</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Yes, of the entire rules, and each delegate should
have a copy if it can be done.</p>
<p>Motion seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is that the Secretary prepare a set
of these rules for each delegate on this floor.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: A point of information. Is the money available
to do so?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It certainly is not.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I move to lay it on the table.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Any remarks on the motion? If not, all those in
favor of the motion will say aye. Contrary no. The motion is
lost.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I wish to correct a mistaken impression.
There is a proviso that provides that those committees that are
not appointed yet are to be appointed to-morrow.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I take that into consideration. The special
order will begin after the committees are complete.</p>
<p>DEL. JACKSON: I move that we go into the election of those
committees now. It is four o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair will consider the order of business
and see if we can&rsquo;t get down to it right away.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I desire information. I see one of the standing
committees is a Committee on Ways and Means. Is that the same
committee that the Chairman of this convention has already
appointed?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, that is a special committee for a special
purpose, as I understand it.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: In view of the fact that the report is going to
take up some time, I believe it will expedite business to take a
recess now until such time as the committees are ready to be
announced. I make that motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair was going to make this suggestion
about that matter, to save as much time as I possibly could: that
on adjournment to-night each delegation get together that know
what they want, and to-morrow morning have the names of your
delegates, and that will avoid any of the time of the convention
being taken up. In the meantime the Chairman can pick out his
three individual members of the committee. That will give him
time. Unless the delegate insists on his motion that will be the
procedure. Do you insist on your motion?</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: I was interrupted and didn&rsquo;t hear. Please
repeat.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair suggested that on the adjournment of
this convention each of the delegates select their member of each
one of the committees, and at the same time let the permanent
Chairman select three individual representatives for each of the
committees, simply having them here to-morrow morning at 9
o&rsquo;clock. That will save a recess, and fifteen minutes would
settle it.</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: I withdraw the motion.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: Do I understand that each national body shall
have one member of each committee from it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Each body that has a delegation shall select one
of their number on this floor.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: And those local unions represented by one
delegate will have power to appoint?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, the chair then selects three members of each
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: The individual members and local bodies of
different classes. There are perhaps men here that represent 500
men in their unions, and there are men representing themselves.
Who designates or decides whether that man shall be from the
local bodies representing several hundred votes?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The opinion of the chair is this, that each of
the delegations appoints one on each committee, and the chair
appoints three.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I represent twenty-three votes in this
convention by myself. How am I to do? To get together with
somebody else, or appoint myself?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I think that if you are given twenty-three votes
by this convention you are entitled to representation on each one
of these committees.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: It seems to me that there is a misunderstanding
in another direction. My understanding is this: that each
delegation, no matter whether they are permitted to install or
not, have a right to select one from their delegation to each
committee, and the Chairman is to select three members from the
individual delegates.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The decision of the chair is that every group
that has been given votes in this convention is entitled to
representation on the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: I rise to make a motion, but I would like to
preface it with a few remarks. A few moments ago we voted down a
proposition to have rules of this convention printed so that each
delegate in the convention would have a copy of those rules.
There are two delegates seated right close here that will copy
those rules on the neostyle or mimeograph free of cost, so that
every delegate in this convention can have a copy of the rules
adopted by this convention without cost to the delegates or to
the organization. I therefore move that we reconsider the motion
by which this convention decided not to get the rules adopted by
this convention printed.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Let me say to the delegate that I do not think a
motion is necessary. If the delegate wants to furnish copies,
well and good, and we will thank him for it, but I do not think
it is necessary to make a motion.</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: You just voted it down.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That does not prevent any delegate from making
copies.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: He wants authority to do it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: He wants authority to do it?</p>
<p>Del. Rowe: Yes, because the convention has decided not to do
this, and if the Secretary of this organization gave the minutes
of this organization to some person that he was not authorized
to, there might be some fault found with him; and in order to
prevent any dissatisfaction, discontent or complaint, I believe
it is best to go on record in a matter of that kind.</p>
<p>Motion seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is that we reconsider the motion to
make a copy of the rules for each delegate. Any remarks?
(Question called for). All those in favor will say aye. Contrary
no. It is so ordered. The motion now is to adopt a motion to
instruct the Secretary to prepare a set of rules for each
delegate. Any remarks on the motion?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: Do we understand that they are to be free of
cost?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: He can turn them over to anybody he pleases. All
in favor of the motion will say aye. Contrary no. It is so
ordered.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I move that each union or organization have its
delegates for committee work selected and ready for work by 9
o&rsquo;clock Thursday morning. (Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>Delegate Schatzki spoke about the undue prominence and power
that would be given under the voting plan to a delegate
representing 20,000 or 40,000 people, as compared with the
position of the individual delegates, but the Chairman ruled the
remarks out of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion before the house is that each group
and the Chairman of this convention shall have the committees
prepared to announce at 9 o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Does &ldquo;each group&rdquo; mean each group of
men that are entitled to come into this body?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, sir, the convention has repeatedly taken
action. The convention itself has said what are the groups in
this body. The motion is that the Chairman be ready to announce
the committees at 9 o&rsquo;clock to-morrow. All in favor say
aye. Contrary no. It is so ordered.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I suggest that the Secretary be instructed to
read out the names of the organizations that come under the head
of groups.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If there is no objection that will be the
procedure.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL, ARKANSAS: The idea that I have gathered
from what has taken place, is this, and I wish to know whether it
is correct. There are delegates who represent locals of the
Western Federation of Miners say, that have nine members. Those
nine men select one man to act on the committee. There are five
or six men that represent the different locals of the U. F. W. A.
Those men get together and elect a man. There may be five or six
members of the Paper Hangers, and they also elect a member. Is
that the idea?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, sir, the idea is that whatever comes from
the individual votes must come through the Chairman of this
convention.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: You misunderstand the meaning of what I was
trying to get at.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: All right.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: I understand that each one of these groups
is to elect a member to act on the committee. Isn&rsquo;t that
true?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegation representing the Western
Federation of Miners will choose a member of the various
committees; the delegates of the S. T. &amp; L. A. will choose
representatives on the various committees. That has been stated
here a good many times.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: I am from No. 194, Painters. They send five
fraternal delegates, and I want to know whether that organization
or delegation is entitled to one member on these various
committees.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If the memory of the chair is correct, the
convention gave those delegates one vote, and if they get on the
committees they will have to go on by appointment of the
chair.</p>
<p>DEL. JAMES SMITH: It seems to me the convention is drifting
away from the issue. I represent nine locals of New York. They
recognize the fact that they have only one vote.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: One vote is what you have, Brother Smith.</p>
<p>DEL. SWARTZ: I want to ask the Chairman in regard to those
groups, if the credentials read that they are authorized to
install their unions in this organization.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I think every group that has been seated by the
convention was authorized to install. I think that is the report
of the Committee on Credentials.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Have it read.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We can have it read.</p>
<p>DEL. SWARTZ: I make a motion to have read each credential.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will do that.</p>
<p>DEL. KNIGHT, PUEBLO: I come from a town out in the West and
represent merely an individual union with thirty members, and I
believe I have been given that number of votes in the convention.
However, I recognize the fact that we will have to stay here
probably ten or fifteen days if every individual who represents a
union like this demands that he have a place on the committee. As
for me, I have seen enough of this convention so far that I
believe there are men on these group who are ready to affiliate
with this convention who possess the capacity and the ability and
the earnestness to fix this constitution and to fix the
declaration of principles to suit me, so that I am willing to
trust some of them, and I think these fellows who are merely
individual delegates, should give these groups a chance, and then
we will all have a chance when they have rendered their
report.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I am not clear on this point yet, although there
has been much said about it. I want to ask a question of the
chair. What is the difference in standing here in this convention
as between groups that are sent here from labor bodies and
individuals that merely represent themselves, in recognition on
this committee? I would like to know this so as to know where we
are at.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The groups that are representing bodies in this
convention have been given a vote for each member of the
organization they represent. The individual simply represents
himself.</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: There is any amount of individuals, but now
there are five of us and we represent 1,700 men, although we
don&rsquo;t claim to vote because we are not here with full power
to act, but I merely would like to know whether there is a
likelihood that such a proceeding will take place afterwards.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We cannot give your organization representation
until it becomes a part of this organization.</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: Then according to your ruling there is no
difference in the standing in this convention between groups and
individual members.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Not except those that have allied themselves
with the movement. The Secretary read the list of groups, as
follows:</p>
<p>Western Federation of Miners, five delegates, 27,000
votes.</p>
<p>Socialist Trade &amp; Labor Alliance, 1,450 votes.</p>
<p>Industrial Workers Club, Cincinnati, 78 votes.</p>
<p>Industrial Workers Club, Chicago, 54 votes.</p>
<p>Workers&rsquo; Industrial Educational Union, Pueblo, 30
votes.</p>
<p>United Metal Workers, 3,000 votes.</p>
<p>United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.</p>
<p>Montreal, Can., Bakers and Confectioners.</p>
<p>United Mine Workers of America, 27 votes.</p>
<p>Flat Janitors&rsquo; Local, Chicago.</p>
<p>Journeyman Tailors&rsquo; Union.</p>
<p>Metal Polishers&rsquo; and Buffers&rsquo; Union.</p>
<p>Journeyman Tailors&rsquo; Protective and Benevolent Union, San
Francisco, 400 votes.</p>
<p>American Labor Union, 16,780 votes.</p>
<p>Punch Press Operators&rsquo; Union, 242, Schenectady, 160
votes.</p>
<p>Tailors of Montreal, 22 votes.</p>
<p>Paper Hangers&rsquo; Union No. 584, Chicago, 87 votes.</p>
<p>United Mine Workers, Pittsburg, Kas.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKI: How many votes are there altogether, I would
like to know?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is going to take up too much time. What is
the difference what the total membership is? There are eighteen
different groups. That will make the membership of each committee
twenty-one.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: A point of information. Will new delegations
likewise have representation?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, surely. What is the pleasure of the
convention?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: It seems to me it might be possible for
delegates to be on each one of these committees. I understood
that was the case as the chair has ruled, but it seems to me that
is pushing it too far, and that some other arrangement should be
made if each and every individual member desires to attend the
sessions of each and every committee, so that you can understand
that it is going to take considerable time to get through with
the business of this convention. For instance, I desire to act
upon five or six committees, each and every one of them.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You will have to figure on the meetings of the
committee. The majority of the committee will decide.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: I move that this convention resolve itself into
a committee of the whole and begin the consideration of the
principles and the platform of the new organization.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: All those in favor of the motion that we now go
into Committee of the Whole to discuss the principles and program
of the organization, will say aye. Contrary no. The motion is
carried. Whom will you have as chairman?</p>
<p>The following nominations were made for Chairman of the
Committee of the Whole: Delegates Goodwin, T. J. Hagerty, Coates,
Haywood, John C. Sullivan, J. W. Saunders, Moyer, Vail. Delegate
Moyer declined.</p>
<p>The Chairman (Delegate Coates) : I am going to make a
proposition to the convention. The proposition is that we all
withdraw in favor of Brother Haywood. (Seconded). All those in
favor of William D. Haywood acting as chairman of the committee
will say aye. Contrary no. Carried.</p>
<h4>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.</h4>
<p>The convention then went into Committee of the Whole, Delegate
Haywood in the chair, at 4.55 P. M.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is the pleasure of the committee? The first
topic for discussion that was suggested by your committee, I
believe, is the name of the organization&mdash;or rather, reasons
for issuing the Manifesto.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I would suggest in this matter that this would be
a pretty good opportunity for a paper on the origin and the cause
of this convention. It seems to me it would be a very opportune
time. We will save that much to-morrow, and it would tend to the
cleaning up of this discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I move that Brother Moyer give us a twenty-minute
talk.</p>
<p>Del. Clarence Smith was called for, but was not present.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKI: Is this discussion now on the reason why the
Manifesto was issued? Shall we speak now on this?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We now await the pleasure of the committee. Is
Brother Ross, of the Press Operators, here? He will please come
forward.</p>
<p>DELEGATE LUCY E. PARSONS: I would like to move that some limit
be placed to the length of time that each delegate can speak.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: It is five minutes.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Aren&rsquo;t we working under the rules as a
Committee of the Whole?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We are in Committee of the Whole.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Then the time is unlimited.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: There was a motion made and seconded that Brother
Moyer give us a twenty-minute talk.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I do not believe that any delegate has a right
to impose that upon the convention.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Did you hear that?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I heard that. I did not hear a second. I heard
the motion. Brother Clarence Smith, the delegates here would like
to hear something about the origin and the call for the
Manifesto.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: Mr. Chairman and Brother Delegates:</p>
<p>I am not reading this because I am best qualified to write it
or read it, but simply because it has been insisted upon that I
do so.</p>
<h4>ORIGIN OF THE MANIFESTO.</h4>
<h4>PAPER By CLARENCE SMITH.</h4>
<p>For a long time the conviction has grown that present
organizations professing to represent industrial unionism were
not securing the strength or doing the work that might be done by
a properly organized and vigorously administered organization of
American wage workers.</p>
<p>Although founded upon a plan that was endorsed in spirit by a
majority of the organized workers of this country, as well as
many of the unorganized, little progress was made by these
organizations professing to represent the class conscious workers
to bring the great mass of sympathetic working people actually
within the ranks of organized workers for the movement.</p>
<p>And while providing the way for perfect solidarity and
entirely harmonious action within itself, this solidarity and
harmony was not actual in the relationship of the organized
bodies comprising the American Labor Union.</p>
<p>This conviction of ineffectiveness in the face of
opportunities for effective work, was strengthened at the General
Convention of the International Union of United Brewery Workmen
last September. It seemed clear that a united, harmonious and
consistent request from all unions and organizations of the A. L.
U., backed by an administration in whom the rank and file of the
brewery workers had confidence, would have brought the brewery
workmen into the A. L. U. at that time. And what would have been
true of the brewery workmen, would have been true also of other
organizations of an industrial character.</p>
<p>It, therefore, seemed the first duty of conscientious union
men, regardless of affiliation, prejudice or personal interest,
to lay the foundation upon which all the working people, many of
whom are now organized, might unite upon a common ground, to
build a labor organization that would correspond to modern
industrial conditions, and through which they might finally
secure complete emancipation from wage slavery for all wage
workers.</p>
<p>November 29, 1904, the following letter, inspired by others as
well as those who signed it, was sent to about thirty men,
inviting them to meet in Chicago, January 2, 1905, to discuss
this question:</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill., Nov. 29, 1904.</p>
<p>Dear Brother:</p>
<p>Developments of the past year have convinced us that craft
division and political ignorance are doomed to speedily end.</p>
<p>Asserting our confidence in the ability of the working class,
if correctly organized, on both industrial and political lines,
to take possession of and operate successfully for their own
interests the industries of the country;</p>
<p>Believing that working class political expression, through the
Socialist ballot, in order to be sound, must have its economic
counterpart in a labor organization builded as the structure of
Socialist society, embracing within itself the working class in
approximately the same groups and departments and industries that
the workers would assume in the working class administration of
the Co-Operative Commonwealth;</p>
<p>Realizing that to wisely inaugurate such a movement will
require the putting aside of every selfish consideration by those
who undertake the tremendous task;</p>
<p>We invite you to meet with us at Chicago, Monday, January 2,
1905, in secret conference, to discuss ways and means of uniting
the working people of America on correct revolutionary
principles, regardless of any general labor organization of past
or present, and only restricted by such basic principles as will
insure its integrity as a real protector of the interests of the
workers.</p>
<p>You are to notify the Committee, through the Secretary, W. L.

<p>My Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>The developments of the past year have convinced us that craft
divisions and political ignorance are doomed to speedily end.</p>
<p>Asserting our confidence in the ability of the working class,
if correctly organized on both industrial and political fields,
to take possession of and operate successfully for their own
interests the industries of this country;</p>
<p>Believing the working class political expression, through the
Socialist ballot, in order to be sound must have its economic
counterpart in a labor organization builded as the structure of
Socialist society, embracing within itself the working class in
approximately the same groups and departments and industries the
workers would assume in the working class administration of the
Co-operative Commonwealth;</p>
<p>Realizing that to wisely inaugurate such a movement will
require the putting aside of every selfish consideration by those
who undertake the tremendous task;</p>
<p>We invite you to meet with us at Chicago, Monday, January 2,
1905, in secret conference, to discuss ways and means of uniting
the working people of America on correct revolutionary
principles, regardless of any general labor organization, past or
present, and only restricted by such basic principles as will
insure its integrity as a real protector of the interests of the
workers.</p>
<p>You are requested to notify the committee, through the
Secretary, W. L. Hall, Room 3, Haymarket Building, Chicago, Ill.,
of your compliance with this invitation.</p>
<p>Names on enclosed list are of those invited to participate in
the conference.</p>

<p>Secretary Committee on Conference, January 2.</p>
<p>Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>The committee&rsquo;s notification at hand. Believe the move a
right one! Will accept the invitation and be in Chicago, January
2, 1905.</p>
<p>In case of any change kindly notify me at once.</p>

<p>Youngstown, Ohio, Dec. 8, 1904.</p>
<p>Dear Comrade Hall:</p>
<p>Your letter sent by &ldquo;special delivery&rdquo; just
reached me, and I am more sorry than I can express that I am not
able (financially) to be with those named for the purposes
indicated, or at least to learn what they are in detail. You may
know that I am one of those wage slaves that has quite a family
and as a rule am always near the last dollar. Something may occur
in the meantime to make it possible for me to be with you and if
it does I surely will be there. If arrangements could be made for
an agitation meeting for the Saturday and Sunday preceding the
date you name it would help matters. I will hope and try. Let me
hear from you again in the matter, telling me where the meeting
is to be held, that is, building, and room, etc., and if possible
I will be on hand.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>J. W. SLAYTON,</p>
<h4>YOUNGSTOWN LABOR ADVOCATE.</h4>
<p>Youngstown, O., Dec. 13, 1904.</p>
<p>Comrade Hall:</p>
<p>I think you can count on me being at the conference to which I
have been invited. I wrote you a few days ago and stated that it
was quite a question on account of financial matters, but I think
that phase of the matter can be overcome and now feel I will be
there.</p>
<p>If anything turns up to prevent, will let you know. In the
meantime let me know where the conference will be held so I will
know just where to look for the comrades.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>J. W. SLAYTON.</p>
<p>J.W. Slayton</p>
<p>Youngstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>My Dear Sir and Comrade:</p>
<p>Your communication of the 13th inst., received. It affords us
much gratification to know that you can shape your affairs to be
with us in conference on the second of January.</p>
<p>This conference will meet at 10 o&rsquo;clock on the morning
of the second, in the Haymarket Theatre, 161 W. Madison street,
this city.</p>
<p>With the compliments of the season and highest personal
regards,</p>
<p>I remain yours fraternally, Secretary.</p>

<h4>THE GALVESTON, HARRISBURG &amp; SAN ANTONIO RAIL WAY CO.</h4>
<p>Langtry, Texas, Dec. 9, 1904.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall, Gen. Sec-Treas, Chicago, My Dear Brother
Hall:</p>
<p>Your letter of recent date duly to hand, relative to the
meeting, etc., and have since received the formal letter of
invitation. Please accept thanks for the honor conveyed. I cannot
say before the twentieth whether or not I shall be able to
attend, but I will advise you about that time one way or the
other. If not permitted to be with you in the flesh, I shall be
in spirit, for as I wrote Comrade Fitz yesterday: &ldquo;It will
be an inspiration to sit in the presence of these &rsquo;destined
to be&rsquo; historic men&mdash;men whom I feel are yet to be
heard in the affairs of nations.&rdquo; Excuse my seeming brevity
as I am working &ldquo;night and day,&rdquo; my partner &ldquo;at
the key&rdquo; being sick, hence I am rushed for time and not fit
for letter writing. I am, as down the ages, your comrade,</p>
<p>ART. V. RALEY.</p>
<h4>THE GALVESTON, HARRISBURG &amp; SAN ANTONIO RAILWAY CO.</h4>
<p>Langtry, Texas, Dec. 30, 1904.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>Room 3, Haymarket Building, Chicago, My Dear Brother Hall:</p>
<p>I write you to regretfully state that on account of financial
circumstances I will not be in Chicago January 2, as I had hoped
for. But I send you my message: &ldquo;Every intelligent
Socialist knows that with freedom of press and speech the cause
must eventually win and by peaceful means. To continue to enjoy
this degree of freedom (I cannot say we have real freedom of
press or speech) is the hope of Socialism&mdash;to defeat even
this present degree, the plan of capitalism. Capitalism owes its
very existence now and hope for the future to the continued
ignorance of the majority. This ignorance cannot continue to
obtain unless a radical change of tactics is inaugurated by
capitalism. The Socialist realizes this, so does the capitalist,
and I say to you that with four years more of the present degree
of freedom of propaganda, the awakening of the masses will have
gained such proportions&mdash;reached that stage that the
situation will have passed beyond the hope of their power to
control by force. To me the coming four years hold the real
crisis. The declared purpose of the Chicago meeting is noble,
grand, and if in addition to adopting certain definite steps for
the collective ownership and control of the means of
life&mdash;some equally feasible plan be adopted for the
systematic and universal dissemination of Socialist truths, that
meeting will have been most opportune. There is nothing so
important as this. Already we may see the hands of love working
with definiteness, if we but look with</p>
<p>faith observing the outward manifestation of these
irresistible unseen forces. So let us have faith and do our part
and these negative powers of darkness now so threatening will
vanish like evil shadows as before the sunrise of this now
swiftly approaching day of universal peace.&rdquo; Your
friend,</p>
<p>A. V. RALEY.</p>
<h4>APPEAL TO REASON.</h4>
<p>Girard, Kansas, Dec. 12, 1904.</p>
<p>Comrade W. L. Hall:</p>
<p>If conditions will permit I may be in at the appointment. But
I wouldn&rsquo;t be worth anything in council. Fraternally,</p>
<p>J. A. WAYLAND.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>Chicago. Ill..</p>
<p>Burke, Ida., Dec. 54, 1904.</p>
<p>Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>Your invitation to hand, and in pursuance of the request
contained therein, I write you to let you know that it will be
impossible for me to attend on account of lack of finances. No
other reason would keep me away from the conference, which means
so much in the labor movement. Though absent in person I will he
with you in spirit and will try and do my share of all the work
in the future.</p>
<p>With regard to all who can meet with you, and hoping for
success, I remain, fraternally yours,</p>
<p>J. W. VINCENT.</p>
<h4>THE INTERNATIONAL LABORERS&rsquo; UNION.</h4>
<p>W. L. Hall, Secretary,</p>
<p>Hayinarket Building, Chicago, Ill. Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>Dayton, Ohio, Dec. &rsquo;5, 1904.</p>
<p>Replying to communication dated November 29, but which arrived
in this morning&rsquo;s mail, will say that at the present moment
it appears as though the conference proposed can be of much good
if even a part of the invited ones take part therein.</p>
<p>For myself, will say, that should a sufficient number exhibit
a desire to be present, it will give me pleasure to be present
and take part in the deliberations of the conference for purposes
as outlined.</p>
<p>My proviso is necessary owing to the volume of work which is
at hand for my attention in my regular line of routine work.</p>
<p>Wishing you success in the attempt, I remain,</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p>International Laborers&rsquo; Union,</p>
<p>Per W. G. CRITCHLOW, General President.</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill., Dec. 16, 1904.</p>
<p>W. C. Critchiow, Esq.,</p>
<p>General President, I. L. U., Dayton, O. My Dear Sir and
Brother:</p>
<p>Your communication of yesterday saying: &ldquo;For myself,
will say, that should a sufficient number exhibit a desire to be
present, it will give me pleasure to be present and take part in
the deliberations of the conference, for the purposes
outlined,&rdquo; has been received. Replying, I am pleased to
inform you that we have received assurance from twenty-five of
the thirty men to whom we have issued invitations, that they will
be present at this conference, which assures its success.</p>
<p>As you suggest in your letter, conditions are such that great
good can be accomplished, just at this time, through a conference
of the men whom we have selected to be present; and I am
satisfied that great good will result.</p>
<p>The subject is of too broad a scope to outline to you by
letter the subject matter that will come up for discussion in
this convention. It is sufficient to suggest to you that the time
is ripe for an economic organization of the world&rsquo;s workers
on lines, as near as possible, like those that would prevail
under the Co-operative Commonwealth; which would represent class
conscious, revolutionary principles.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the convention is to harmonize the warring
factions in the various divisions of the progressive forces in
the United States; and such other matter as might be
suggested.</p>
<p>The convention is to be called at 10 o&rsquo;clock on the
morning of January 2, in the Haymarket Theatre, 167 W. Madison
street, in this city, and I trust that you will be able to shape
affairs to be present.</p>
<p>With highest personal regards and compliments of the season,
I</p>
<p>remain, yours fraternally, Secretary.</p>
<h4>THE INTERNATIONAL LABORERS&rsquo; UNION.</h4>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall, Secretary,</p>
<p>No. 3 Haymarket Building, Chicago, Ill. Dear Sir and
Brother:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 16th bearing upon the proposed conference
at Chicago, January 2, at hand this morning and carefully
noted.</p>
<p>Accepting your statements, under the circumstances, you can
count on my presence at the specified place and time.</p>
<p>Two members of our Executive Board and myself will also arrive
in Chicago Tuesday evening, the 20th, and expect to have a
conference with A. L. U. that evening. Since writing Smith have
seen where he is in Denver, but we cannot alter our arrangements
now. Perhaps he will return by the 20th though. It might be well
for you to have the letter read to you in the A. L. U. office
which he wrote on the 16th.</p>
<p>Dayton, Ohio, Dec. 18, 1904.</p>
<p>Will probably see you Tuesday evening or Wednesday
morning,</p>
<p>anyway&mdash;hope so at least</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p>International Laborers&rsquo; Union,</p>
<p>Per W. G. CRITCHLOW, General President</p>
<h4>APPEAL TO REASON.</h4>
<p>Girard, Kansas, Dec. 17, 1904</p>
<p>W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>No. 3 Haymarket Theatre Building, Chicago, Ill. Dear Sir and
Brother:</p>
<p>Invitation to meet a number of the brothers interested in the
labor movement at Chicago, January 2, 1905, received, and I
regret more than I can express my inability to attend and take
part in this discussion upon which I fully realize much
depends.</p>
<p>I have engagements, which I cannot postpone, that will fully
occupy all my time for the next thirty days.</p>
<p>However, in looking over the names of those invited I see so
many who, like myself, stand for industrial unionism that I feel
my absence will in no way interfere with the success of the
meeting.</p>
<p>As Brother McDonald will tell you, I&rsquo;m with you to the
last ditch. Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>E. N. RICHARDSON.</p>
<h4>IDAHO STATE TRIBUNE.</h4>
<p>December 18, 1904.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>The invitation to meet in conference in Chicago on January 2,
1905, with some of the noble souls of the labor movement, reached
me in due time.</p>
<p>Nothing in this world would give me greater pleasure than to
comply with that invitation, as I appreciate the importance and
necessity for such a conference, and the men composing it are the
men whom labor can depend upon with their whole heart and soul to
do the right thing in their interest.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it makes me almost weep when I
confess to you that my present circumstances will not permit me
being present. It is a long ways from here to Chicago and I have
not the means nor dare I spare the time at present to make the
trip. So I will not be with you in flesh, but will be in spirit.
My heart beats as strongly as ever for humanity&rsquo;s cause,
and I only wish I could grasp the hand of each one of the
proposed conferees and start the battle anew.</p>
<p>I approve of the course the invitation outlines, and I
appreciate the necessity for it, and I trust the conference will
result in such cry of the wage slave.</p>
<p>Count me with you in voice and action as far as in my power
lies. Count me one of you, and perhaps the day is not far distant
when I can take an active part in whatever plan is outlined.</p>
<p>Give my kindest wishes to all who participate as I count them
accomplishments as will make America ring with the emancipating
all my friends, for they are the friends of all humanity.</p>
<p>Give me whatever work I can perform after the conference is
over and I shall perform to the best of my ability and
opportunity.</p>
<p>Yours for emancipation and with best wishes for the work
of</p>
<p>the conference, D. C. COATES.</p>
<h4>GRAND LODGE SWITCHMEN&rsquo;S UNION OF NORTH AMERICA.</h4>
<p>Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 26, 1904.</p>
<p>W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>Room No. 3, Haymarket Building, Chicago, Ill. Dear Sir and
Brother:</p>
<p>Replying to your favor of December 24, permit me to assure you
that it is with the deepest sense of appreciation I accept the
kind invitation to be present January 2, 1905.</p>
<p>At present I am unable to leave the house owing to an old
wound which has completely incapacitated me for the past three
weeks. Yet I assure you that I will be present if it is possible
for me to travel at all, for to me it would be the pleasure of a
lifetime to live for a day in the presence of the men you have
mentioned in list. I being a railroad man it is almost needless
for me to state that I was one of our worthy Brother E. V.
Debs&rsquo; admirers as well as supporter in 1894, and will hail
with joy the opportunity of once more grasping the hand of our
noble chief. And while I have been for years associated with
labor unions, my contentions are that permanent relief must come
through Socialism. Thus, in my humble opinion, the star of our
hopes, instead of being unionism, is Socialism.</p>
<p>Yet it is very necessary that labor unions be strengthened to
the utmost until such times as Socialism has acquired strength to
properly defend the wealth producer against the encroachments of
the trusts and combines of greedy capital, thus hoping, as you
say, that craft divisions and political ignorance are doomed to a
speedy end.</p>
<p>I remain with earnest wishes for the success of meeting, also
for future welfare of the wealth producer of America.</p>
<p>Truly yours,</p>
<p>W. C. WALSH.</p>
<h4>GRAND LODGE SWITCHMEN&rsquo;S UNION OF NORTH AMERICA.</h4>
<p>Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 31, 1904</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>My Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>It would be utterly impossible for me to express the regret I
feel at finding myself unable to attend meeting on Monday next,
but my affliction is such that I am unable to walk the wound
referred to has resolved itself into a very painful ulcer.</p>
<p>However, it does not prevent me from wishing you and all my
noble brethren a God speed in your undertaking in behalf of
toiling humanity, and I hasten to say to you that upon my word
and honor as a man and citizen of the United States to do all
within my power to assist in this noble work; and again wishing
for our future success, I remain, truly yours,</p>
<p>W. C. WALSH.</p>
<h4>INTERNATIONAL UNION OF THE UNITED BREWERY WORKMEN OF
AMERICA.</h4>
<p>Cincinnati, Ohio, Dec. 21, 1904.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>Room No. 3, Haymarket Theatre Building, Chicago, Ill. Dear Sir
and Comrade:</p>
<p>Your invitation of recent date to attend a conference to
beheld in the City of Chicago on January 2, 1905, by a number of
prominent men active in the labor movement and a number of
Socialists, is to hand. In reply will say that you must excuse me
for not answering sooner, but circumstances did not permit
it.</p>
<p>The main reasons for holding this conference, as I understand
them, are to find ways and means to bring new life into the
trades union movement of the country particularly, and, if
possible, to change the present tactics of this movement and make
same more progressive, more effective and more beneficiary to the
wage workers of this country; also to build up a great class
conscious organization.</p>
<p>It affords me great pleasure to be one of the invited
comrades, but am sorry to say that for the following reasons I am
unable to attend, and no doubt my colleague, Comrade Trautmann,
who suggested my name, will corroborate my statement and my
reasons:</p>
<p>First, my term of office as international secretary-treasurer
expires on January 1, 1905, on which date my successor, Comrade
Adam Huebner, will take charge of my office, and as Comrade
Huebner is not acquainted with the work and as this work must be
done very carefully, bookkeeping and finances being involved,
therefore it is not very convenient for me to go, especially not,
as Brother Huebner would undoubtedly feel slighted if I should
absent myself without first having made him acquainted with his
work. Further, it would not relieve me of my
responsibilities.</p>
<p>Second, I am not well enough acquainted with the English
language to take such part in the debates and discussions as I
would like to take.</p>
<p>Third, I am not in the best of health and must take care of
myself.</p>
<p>You can rest assured that I regret my inability to be present,
as I am deeply interested in any movement that would bring about
a more powerful and a more perfect organization, which would
benefit the wage workers of this country, and would hasten the
time of the emancipation of the wage workers from wage
slavery.</p>
<p>My ideal of a genuine and good labor movement always was and
is to-day, first, industrial organizations; that is, all employes
of a certain industry to be organized under one great
International Union, which should be affiliated with one gigantic
national body, and then with an international alliance.</p>
<p>Second, we must not allow one industrial organization to build
a Chinese wall around itself. Free transfers must be given by and
accepted by one organization from another organization for
members in good standing.</p>
<p>Third, we must get the control of not only the Government of
this country, but of all civilized countries, and establish the
Cooperative Commonwealth. This must be brought about by the use
of the ballot box as taught by international Socialism.</p>
<p>Trusting that you will excuse my non-attendance, wishing you
the best of success, and hoping that your work may be of
everlasting benefit to the wage workers of this country, I
remain,</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p>JUL. ZORN, International Secretary.</p>
<p>Wallace, Idaho, Dec. 27, 1904.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Hall,</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>Reply to your favor concerning the conference to be held in
Chicago January 2, 1905, will say that I reached home Christmas
Day after journeying from Boston, and owing to how I feel at this
time I would not like to undertake another long trip. Therefore,
I will be unable to be at your conference however much I would
like to. In your deliberations I will be with you in spirit, and
wish you the greatest measure of success in your
deliberations.</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p>EDWARD BOYCE.</p>
<p>Terre Haute, Ind., Dec. 23, 1904.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarence Smith,</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>My Dear Comrade:</p>
<p>Your several favors have been received and noted. I have been
unable to answer sooner, on account of illness which has kept me
confined to my room during the last several weeks and from which
I am but slowly recovering. The doctor has just informed me that
I shall probably have to go South before there will be any
appreciable recuperation of my strength. I shall not be able to
attend the meeting on the second. I keenly regret this for I had
counted on being with you and in giving such assistance as I
could to the work of organizing that is to be undertaken along
new and progressive lines. In spite of my best will this is now
impossible. For a good many years I have been working without
regard to myself and in all my life I have never known what it is
to have a rest. The last year&rsquo;s work was in many respects
the hardest of my life. I spent myself too freely and have now
reached the point when I must give up for a time as the doctor
warned me that my nerves are worn down and that I am threatened
with collapse. There is nothing the matter with me except that I
am compelled to let go for a time and so I have had to cancel all
my engagements for the immediate future. How soon I may be able
to resume I do not know, but I think I shall have to quit the
public platform entirely, or almost so, for a year or such
matter. There are too many demands constantly upon me and I shall
have to turn them aside until I can get myself in physical
condition to resume my activities. Under any other circumstances
I should have considered it a privilege as well as a pleasure to
attend your meeting.</p>
<p>Please find draft enclosed covering the amount you were kind
enough to advance to me. Please accept my warm thanks for the
favor.</p>
<p>Profoundly regretting my inability to be with you and hoping
the meeting may be fruitful of all the good results anticipated,
I remain, yours faithfully,</p>
<p>E. V. DEBS.</p>
<h4>CLEVELAND TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION NO. 53.</h4>
<p>Cleveland, O., Dec. 30, 1904.</p>
<p>W. L. Hall:</p>
<p>Dear Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>For two important reasons I will be unable to be present at
the conference to which you have so kindly invited me, viz:
&ldquo;financial embarrassment, and, secondly, I am not
altogether clear, as to what can be done or what it is proposed
to do. You say, in the third paragraph, in substance, that the
Socialist party must have its &ldquo;economic counterpart,&rdquo;
etc., and in the fifth paragraph that it is your purpose to unite
the workers on correct, revolutionary principles
&ldquo;regardless of any general labor organization of past or
present.&rdquo; This sounds to me as though we are to have
another S. T. &amp; L. A. experiment over again; that we, who are
in the trade unions as at present constituted, are to cut loose
and flock by ourselves. If I am correct in my surmises it means
another running fight between Socialists on the one side and all
other partisans on the other. Let me say frankly that under no
circumstances will I permit myself to be dragged into any more
secession movements or fratricidal wars between factors of
workers because they are not of one mind at this juncture. If
there is any fighting to be done I intend to use my energies and
whatever ability I may possess to bombard the common
enemy&mdash;capitalism. Moreover, I intend to put in whatever
time and means that I have to agitate on the inside of the
organizations now in existence to dump conservatism overboard and
prepare to take their places &ldquo;in the working class
administration of the Co-operative Commonwealth.&rdquo; Unless I
am very much mistaken the rank and file of the trade unions are
awakening as never before, and as soon as even a good-sized
minority become thoroughly class conscious, the fossilized
leaders will &ldquo;go up in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a strategic standpoint I would rather be inside the fort
and take chances to secure the adoption of my plans than to be
outside and regarded as an enemy. If the leaders of the S. L. P.,
so-called, had not made a number of glaring mistakes (as time has
proven they did) the workers would have been won open to
conviction long ago, and those of us who are active would not
have been compelled to fight on the defensive. While not denying
the right of men to secede, I question the tactics and especially
when circumstances do not warrant such a move. At the present
time the so-called pure and simple unions are throwing open their
doors to a full and free discussion of all economic questions. I
do not see that a purely Socialist union could do any more. And
even if the present organizations changed their names next week
and adopted high-sounding resolutions it would not mean any more
Socialist votes unless the members understood our principles and
changed their opinions.</p>
<p>Personally, I have absolutely no fear for the future as far as
the present trade unions are concerned. While a few of the
leaders are now &ldquo;jagged&rdquo; with power and a sense of
their own importance, their peculiar performances makes their
position insecure. If I am mistaken in my surmises and those who
gather at your conference adopt ways and means to increase the
activity and agitation in the trade unions in favor of
progressive measures, and formulate plans to join and assist in
the battle, nothing would please me more. In fact, I am sure that
the conservative leaders would be more pleased to learn that they
are to have opposition from the outside than that such opposition
was becoming more formidable on the inside. I happen to know, for
instance, that at every Federation convention there is more
speculation and worrying about what the twenty or thirty odd
Socialists intend doing than any equal number of men. Suppose the
number of Socialist delegates were doubled or trebled?</p>
<p>Sincerely hoping that your conference will be able to grasp
the full significance of the opportunities that confront our
movement, and thanking you for the invitation extended, I am,</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>MAX S. HAYES.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I should like to hear from Mother Jones on this
question.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Mother says she is not ready to be heard
from yet. What is the pleasure of the committee?</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I move that the committee rise and report
progress. (No second.)</p>
<p>DEL. ALBERT RYAN: Before adjournment I would like to make an
announcement, that the special committee that was appointed this
forenoon in reference to the stenographic report will meet on the
stage immediately after adjournment.</p>
<p>The motion to rise and report progress was seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A motion has been made that the committee now
rise and report progress. Are you ready for the motion?</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: As long as we have an hour&rsquo;s time at our
disposal, I think it ought to be devoted to the purpose for which
we first went into Committee of the Whole. I hope that the motion
will be voted down.</p>
<p>The motion that the committee rise and report progress was
then put and carried, and the committee rose.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I move that the proceedings of the Committee of
the Whole be made a part of the proceedings of the
convention.</p>
<p>The motion was seconded and carried.</p>
<h4>AUDITING COMMITTEE.</h4>
<p>Del. Clarence Smith: I move that the Chairman appoint a
committee of three to inspect and audit the accounts of the
Executive Committee up to this convention and report to the
convention.</p>
<p>The motion was seconded and carried. The Chairman appointed as
the Auditing Committee Delegates Powers, Saunders and
Twining.</p>
<h4>BADGES.</h4>
<p>The Credentials Committee then distributed badges to the
delegates as the names were called.</p>
<p>There being no further business brought before the convention,
an adjournment was then, at 5.10 P. M., taken until A. M.
Thursday.</p>
