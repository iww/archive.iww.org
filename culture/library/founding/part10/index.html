<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>SIXTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Monday, July 3</h3>
<h3>AFTERNOON SESSION</h3>
<p>Chairman Haywood called the convention to order at one
o&rsquo;clock P. M., and called Del. Coates to take his place as
Chairman.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTIONS.</h4>
<p>Del. McDonald, on behalf of the Committee on Organization,
reported back Resolution No. 16, offered by Delegates Trautmann,
Hagerty and De Leon, and Resolution No. 18, offered by Delegate
Chas. Kiehn, with a recommendation that the convention adopt No.
18 in place of No. 16.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: Comrade Chairman, I desire to know whether this
resolution, which the committee recommends, ties up this body
with the International Socialist Bureau at Brussels, Belgium, or
whether it opens this up to communication with all international
headquarters which may be located in any place all over Europe,
London, Berlin or wherever else it may be. I ask as a point of
information. I want to know where we are at. We want to know what
we are going to do before we act.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: It simply says here that the incoming Executive
Board has instructions to correspond with the trades and labor
unions located in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: Located in Berlin. We have heard that, located
in Berlin. Comrades, do you know what the situation in Berlin
is?</p>
<p>A delegate raised a point of order.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: I am willing to yield the floor to another
motion. What is before the house at this time?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have the recommendation of your
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: Has any motion been made to adopt it at this
time?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I think this delegate was going to make a motion
before when he arose.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: I am going to make a motion to this effect,
that this resolution be stricken out or laid on the table, either
way you please to take it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That the report of the committee be laid on the
table?</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there a second to the motion?</p>
<p>Motion seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That carries with it, of course, the other
resolution.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: Has any motion been made to adopt it at this
time?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I think this delegate was going to make a motion
before when he arose.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I would like to ask for information.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Are you through, Delegate La Monte?</p>
<p>Del. La Monte: No, I am not through.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is the information?</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I would like to know why we should tie
ourselves first to the labor organizations of Berlin in
preference to any other place on earth.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is not a question of information.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: A point of order. There is nothing before the
house except this resolution, and no one can receive or have the
floor except it is to rise to make a motion. The brother made a
motion, but there was no second. Therefore he is not entitled to
speak unless he gets permission.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I am just trying to tell him that.</p>
<p>Del. La Monte: I still have the floor?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: I make a motion that this resolution be
stricken out.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there a second to the motion that the
resolution be laid on the table?</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: No, I did not make that. I made a motion that
the resolution be stricken out.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is not a proper motion.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I move you as the chairman of the Committee on
Organization that the report of the Committee on Organization be
accepted and the resolution adopted. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is moved and seconded that the report of the
Committee on Organization be accepted.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: As a member of the Committee on Resolutions I
would like to give the delegate that spoke just now the
information as to the reason that induced me to offer this
resolution. The international secretariat of the trade and labor
unions of Europe is located in Berlin. It not only consists of
the labor unions of Germany, but of all Europe. The international
headquarters is fixed in Berlin, Germany. It is an institute for
the exchange of views of the different labor organizations,
compiling statistics and other matters pertaining to the
international trade union and labor movement. It is different
from the International Socialist Bureau in Belgium. That is
another institution altogether.</p>
<p>DEL. TRAUTMANN: When the general conference met a question
came up as to relations with organizations in other countries
built upon recognition of the class struggle, and the Secretary
of the conference was instructed to communicate with such other
organizations as recognized the same principle already as will be
the foundation and the fundamental basis of this new proposed
organization. There are two bureaus, a bureau for the Socialist
political parties with headquarters in Brussels, and a
headquarters of international unions based and founded upon the
recognition of the class struggle with headquarters in Berlin.
Comrade Legien, a Social Democratic member of the German
Reichstag, is the general secretary of those organizations. The
French organizations give a full report&mdash;here it
is&mdash;from all the bureaus, including Spain, South Australia
and New Zealand. I have the answers to the invitation to send
delegates to this convention. They will be laid before this
convention, and you can then form your opinions. There are five
bureaus already attached to the general industrial central
organization, and the first report is in conjunction with the
report of the Socialist Bureau this year. Here are the addresses
of those organizations that are founded on the same fundamental
principles that underlie this organization. The object of
establishing international relations is to make the industrial
unions of Europe co-operate with the organizations in this
country so that, for instance, when emigrants from foreign
countries, including Japan, leave their country to find shelter
in this country, that they may be already advised that here is an
organization that will open the doors to every immigrant, no
matter where he may come from. (Applause.) Now, I communicated
with the unions of Japan. I communicated with all countries with
the exception of such countries where such unions are not in
existence. In explaining at the general conference the difference
between the pure and simple craft unions, the government unions
of Russia, the yellow unions of France and the blue unions of
Germany, I showed the difference in tactics between those pure
and simple European organizations that are used in the same way
that the American Federation of Labor is used as the instrument
of the capitalist class. I venture to say, from the experience of
the last year, if we firmly connect ourselves with that bureau,
that the members of our class, members of progressive
organizations of labor, will know when they leave the other
countries that there are organizations with which they can
immediately associate themselves and become a working member of
an organization working on the same lines as those in the old
countries. Not only will these relations extend to the unions
that are to-day connected with the international unions in
Berlin, but these relations will go further and extend to Russia.
We are aware of the fact that Bakunin or the followers of Bakunin
rather have in the last five years organized economic
organizations on the class struggle that will certainly come
under the head of the organization that we are going to form, and
with whom we can establish such relations as to bring the
immigrants from foreign countries immediately into the folds of
industrial unions of this country. Perhaps it would be taking too
much of the time of the convention to go into it in detail, but
you can see from letters from Denmark, South Australia, Germany
and other countries where we have such organizations existing,
that they fully agree with the principles underlying this new
organization. If we are ourselves further advanced or represent a
further advance it is for the reason that capitalism is further
advanced in this country. In my letters that I sent to them I
pointed out to them the difference between the American
Federation and us, and it was the general secretary of France who
grasped at once the significance of this new organization and had
a big article in The People, in which he points out the
difference between the American Federation of Labor and the
proposed organization. I know from experience that men who have
been trained and skilled in the Socialist party in the old
country, unable to assimilate or affiliate with the old working
class organizations, have become stagnant and finally
conservative. They became the henchmen of the capitalist class
because they did not find an organization that was built on the
underlying principles on which we propose to build this in this
country.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Are there any other delegates that wish to speak
on this motion?</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the report be adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: A point of information. The way I understand
&ldquo;international,&rdquo; it means that we want only one
headquarters for international purposes and one secretary. There
is already such an organization in Europe as an international
movement to adopt our plans. Now, the question is, shall we
recognize the German headquarters, or shall the Germans recognize
that we will establish the headquarters here? I would like to
find out where we shall establish our international
headquarters.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is for the international congress to
settle.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: All those in favor of the motion to adopt the
report of the committee as a substitute for the original
resolution will say aye. Contrary no. The motion is adopted.</p>
<h4>LITERATURE AND PRESS.</h4>
<p>DEL. BRIMBLE: I made a mistake this morning. When you called
for the report of the Committee on Literature and Press I said
there was no report and that nothing had been settled by it.
There has been a part of the work done.</p>
<p>Del. Dinger read the following report on behalf of the
committee, he not being a member :</p>
<h4>IS THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD A POLITICAL
ORGANIZATION?</h4>
<p>The inherent weakness of the arguments against the United
Workers and industrial unionism is proven by the fact that the
only thing that is used with any effect by its enemies is a lie.
That is, that the United Workers is not in fact a labor
organization, but a political movement.</p>
<p>On account of many of the organized and unorganized working
people being ignorant of the real principles and purposes of this
new labor unionism, it is necessary that these charges that are
being made by the salaried officials of craft unionism, by the
so-called labor papers that depend upon craft unionism for
support, and by the capitalist press, be refuted.</p>
<p>In the American Federationist, official magazine of the
American Federation of Labor, for March, 1905, Samuel Gompers,
its editor, referring to the Industrial Union Manifesto, says</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Socialists have called another Convention to smash
the American trade union movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Iowa State Federation of Labor, acting upon this
misrepresentation, adopted the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few disgruntled office seekers and would-be
politicians have seen fit to criticise the present methods and
government of our trade organizations; and these same people have
issued a call for a Convention to be held in the City of Chicago
June 27, 1905, to form an organization TO BE A POLITICAL
INDUSTRIAL LABOR ORGANIZATION, the avowed purpose of which is the
complete annihilation of the present trade union movement BY
POLITICAL METHODS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Advance Advocate, a so-called labor paper depending upon
Gompersism for support, says</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now a new industrial union is to be launched in
Chicago. It is going to revolutionize the whole labor movement,
according to the Manifesto of its promoters. IT IS GOING INTO
POLITICS. We predict that it will fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Milwaukee journal, a capitalist daily newspaper, repeating
the chorus of all capitalist newspapers, has this to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Socialists are still earnestly advocating the
formation of a new national organization in the hope of downing
the American Federation of Labor, as the federation is opposed to
making the labor union a political organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These falsehoods have been freely circulated in craft union
literature, and more freely by the capitalist press, in spite of
the fact that not a word can be found in any of the official acts
or utterances of the United Workers, or of the Conferences or
Conventions that brought it into existence, or in the Manifesto
or other industrial union literature, to justify them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every official declaration of the United
Workers and the Industrial Union movement on this question has
been clear and unmistakable AGAINST making it a political
organization or a political movement. The Manifesto declares:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It (the industrial union) should be established as the
economic organization of the working class, WITHOUT AFFILIATION
WITH ANY POLITICAL PARTY.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The United Workers is not a political party. It is a labor
union. It is made necessary because other so-called labor
organizations have proved themselves incompetent and unable to
represent the working class. It also declares its final purpose
to be the abolition of wage slavery and complete freedom of the
working class in the possession of the means of production and
distribution.</p>
<p>While the United Workers is not a political party, and does
not affiliate with any political party, the capitalists must not
delude themselves with the idea that they alone are wise enough
to know the value of political power, and that they, through the
political ignorance of the working people, will be free and
unhampered in placing capitalist servants in charge of the
law-making and law-executing powers, and in using for the benefit
of the employing class the policemen&rsquo;s clubs and the guns
of the soldiery.</p>
<p>The United Workers and the industrial union movement reserves
the right for its members to use, outside this labor
organization, in a political way, any weapon that will prove
useful in the struggle for economic betterment.</p>
<p>As organized workers we oppose every form of working class
ignorance, and urge all working people to study politics, and
advise all unions to set apart a time to study political
questions, to the end that when the working people use the
ballot, their votes may be cast unitedly in their own
interests.</p>
<p>The reading of the report was greeted with applause.</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: As I understood that resolution this
organization shall have no affiliation with any political party,
and yet it is implied throughout that political action, in the
parliamentary sense of the word is necessary. I make a motion
that that resolution be tabled. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>Motion to table put and lost. A motion was made to adopt.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move that this article that was read be
referred to the incoming General Executive Board, for final
action. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I do not think there is any necessity of
referring this to the Executive Board. It seems to me that this
convention is wise enough to know the sort of literature it
desires to place before the working people of this country. It
seems to me that the combined intelligence of the delegates in
this convention is greater than the intelligence of any set of
men that can be selected from this convention as an Executive
Board. (Applause.) This document is not so long as it appears
from the manner in which it, was read. The document contains less
than 700 words, and can be easily printed on two small pages. I
know that the document does, not provide that the organization
shall be committed to politics. It was decided by the Committee
on Literature and Press that it was absolutely necessary to
answer the question or claim of the enemies of this movement that
this organization was to be a political organization. It was
absolutely necessary to refute that assertion of our enemies, and
in this document the Committee on Literature and Press has
attempted to answer it in a clear and concise way without
committing the organization to any political party, or to
politics at all in fact. I will not read the first part of the
document, which simply gives the charge that it is a political
organization, but I will simply read a part of the answer to that
charge: &ldquo;On the other hand, every official declaration of
the United Workers and the industrial union movement on this
question has been clear and unmistakable against making it a
political organization or a political movement. The Manifesto
declares&rdquo;&mdash;and then quotes from the Manifesto as
follows: &ldquo;The United Workers is not a political party. It
is a labor union. It is made necessary because other so-called
labor organizations have proved themselves incompetent and unable
to represent the working class in its every-day struggles with
the employing class.&rdquo; This sentence asserts that the
fundamental principle of the organization is economic. It goes
on: &ldquo;It also declares its final purpose to be the abolition
of wage slavery and complete freedom of the working class in the
possession of the means of production and distribution. While the
United Workers is not a political party and it is not affiliated
with any political party, the capitalists must not delude
themselves with the idea that they alone are wise enough to know
the value of political power and that they through the political
ignorance of the working class will be free and unhampered in
placing capitalist servants in charge of the law-making and
law-executing power and in using for the benefit of the employing
class the policemen&rsquo;s club&mdash;and the guns of the
soldiery. The United Workers and the industrial union movement
reserve the right for its members to use outside of this labor
organization in a political way any weapon that will prove useful
in the struggle for economic betterment.&rdquo; It does not even
commit the organization to the proposition that politics is a
useful weapon. It urges all working people to study politics and
advises all unions to set apart a time for political discussion
to the end that when union men use the ballot they may cast it
unitedly, in their own interest. It seems to me, Mr. Chairman,
that if this convention is to decide that the working class
through the unions of this proposed organization shall not be
permitted to discuss politics and shall not be permitted to
consider political questions, it will place this organization on
the same narrow basis that the American Federation of Labor now
takes on that question. It seems to me that this organization can
take a broad stand on this question that will permit a free and
unlimited discussion of political questions as well as all other
questions that concern the working class in this way. If we do
that, if we simply permit the workers in this proposed
organization to study these questions in their own way, we can
rest assured that if the political field is the field whereon to
circumvent capitalism it will be taken advantage of by the
members of this organization; and if politics is not a field that
will be proper for carrying on the work of the organization the
workers in this new movement can never learn that any quicker
than by studying political questions for themselves.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: I am afraid the brother over there did
not understand the matter when it was read. He has confused a
quotation from Gompers&rsquo;s paper as the utterance of the
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: No.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: I think you did. I don&rsquo;t see how else
you can come to the conclusion that you have. The American
Federationist and papers of that class have continually charged
the Manifesto with being a movement to bring a political movement
out of the labor movement. This is simply a statement to the
people at large that that is not true. It is not to-day, and it
never has been true. The American Federation comes out point
blank and instructs its members that they must not meddle with
politics. This organization, on the contrary, says that the
industrial union, as I understand, is to be an economic
organization for the purpose of the betterment of the wage
working class or the working class. If that is true, why should
not the laborer, who to-day is the most ignorant as to political
economy of any man on earth&mdash;why should he not be set clear
on that point?</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: I protest. The workingman is not the most
ignorant man as to the laws of political economy.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: If he were not ignorant on that subject you
would never find him lined up in support of the other fellow.
(Applause.) You better keep still after this, till you know the
man that you go up against. The position of the committee,
therefore, was to strive to bring out a statement to the public
at large to set them right in reference to the charges made
against this proposed organization by the American Federationist.
That is all I wanted to say.</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: The delegate said that I misunderstood this. The
address says, &ldquo;The United Workers is not a political party.
It is a labor union. It is made necessary because other so-called
labor organizations have proved themselves
incompetent&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: A point of order. We are discussing a motion to
refer to the Executive Board, and not what the other people may
say.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That opens the entire matter for discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: I will read: &ldquo;The United Workers is not a
political party. It is a labor organization. It is made necessary
because other so-called labor organizations have proved
themselves incompetent and unable to represent the working class
in its everyday struggles with the employing class.&rdquo; I
understand that out of this criticism of other organizations
comes this organization. It says it comes to fight the battles of
labor on the economic field, and inasmuch as it does that it is
nothing more. Do you delegates assembled here believe that this
economic union of the working class will remain only economic?
The Black Sea events have proved that the struggle in Russia is
finally political. There is no ballot box in Russia, and the
Russians do not need it, because under their conditions they must
struggle without the ballot box. This address says: &ldquo;It
also declares its final purpose to be the abolition of wage
slavery and complete freedom of the working class in the
possession of the means of production and distribution.&rdquo; If
this is the purpose of this organization as this resolution sets
forth here, it makes a denial of the statement going before, that
it is not a political movement. The very act of the working class
organized into this union, in seizing the means of production and
distribution, is of itself political, and I hold that a union
which proposes to take from the capitalist class these things and
give them to the working class is of itself a political act. The
Democratic and Republican parties have the election machinery,
and every time we want anything we must go before the capitalist
class and ask for it at their ballot. Here is the Socialist Labor
Party. Every State in the Union denies its right to the ballot
box. In every State it is not recognized as a political party,
and it goes before the capitalist class of this country demanding
from the capitalist class the right to go on its ballot. I want
to know what we are here for. Do we come here asking favors for
the working class? This resolution contradicts itself. In one
place it says this is a purely economic organization, and then it
goes on and says its purposes are political. If this organization
goes on record recognizing the need of the ballot box in its
parliamentary revolution, if it educates the working class along
those lines, then it is going into politics pure and simple. Up
till 1896 the idea of &ldquo;economic organization&rdquo; was
never preached. The subject was never presented before the
working class. The S. L. P. started the S. T. &amp; L. A. First
the political must dominate the economic. Here it says the
economic must dominate the political, or the political
organization must justify itself before the economic. I say that
the political must justify itself before the economic. If the
economic organization is open to justification, then it is wrong
to that extent. Now, what does the working class know or care
about capitalist politics? You cannot get on the ballot unless
you ask the capitalists, and if the capitalists see fit they may
keep you off. You belong to the working class, and there has not
been a law passed in the interest of labor but what the
capitalist supreme court has stood ready to strike it off the
statute book. And if you go into politics and elect your
candidate the capitalist judges will declare the election
unconstitutional or illegal. Take Colorado. A capitalist,
supported by labor votes, Adams, was elected governor by an
overwhelming majority in Colorado, and the election was thrown
out and Peabody put in his place. Go where you will, you have got
to ask the capitalists for the right to go on the ballot. I say
this convention ought to declare itself on that one point.</p>
<p>DEL. GUY MILLER: It seems to me unnecessary to explain the
attitude of the delegate who has just spoken. Every man here
understands that political and religious institutions are but the
reflection of the economic system of production, and that when
this convention sets before itself the task of bringing about an
economic revolution it also prepares the way for a revolution in
every field of society, and in every other field of thought. That
seems to me to need no further discussion. And now the fact that
we propose to bring about the industrial union of the workers,
that we propose to make the solidarity of the interests of the
working class a fact in an organization whose purpose is to do
business with the capitalist class and to favor that unity which
is to be brought about in the white heat of action, will not be
lost sight of or forgotten or overlooked when it comes to the
ballot box. This organization is prepared to support the
interests of the working class upon every field of action, on
every field whereon its interests are at stake. Its purposes are
just as wide as the interests and needs of the working class. We
do not propose to throw down one censorship of human thought and
replace it by another. We propose to be free to express opinions
in the union regarding all the interests of the workers of this
country. That is what we have been defeated in in the past; that
is what we are to secure in the future. I believe that most of
the people who have listened to the reading of this resolution
recognize the fact that the political movement and the industrial
movement are but the two hands that are each to do battle for the
interest of the working class. And since government is but a
reflection of economic systems of production, through
strengthening our arms on the industrial field we shall also make
our voices more effective on the political field. The expression
at the ballot box, the casting of a Socialist ballot, is
something more than putting in a mere piece of paper. That is all
right. The fundamental mistake occurs on the part of many who are
members of this convention in thinking that that is all. It is
the expression of the determination on the part of the men who
cast that ballot to back up that expression of the working class
by the entire strength of that class; that is what it means to
cast a Socialist ballot. So people are fundamentally mistaken
when they consider that we are mere theorists. But upon the other
hand, if the Socialist believes in the expression of our interest
at the ballot box, the industrialist also believes in the union
of the worker in the factory and the mine to best conserve and
protect that interest which is expressed at the ballot box. Each
of these two forms is necessary if we are to secure our freedom.
The strike is in its incipiency a revolution, only too often the
men who strike are ignorant of the fact. It is a demand for a
larger part of the products of their toil, with the power to say
something regarding the conditions under which they must earn
their bread. Statements have been made here regarding unions,
that they were not consciously formed on the lines of the class
struggle, most of them. That is the reason why our battles have
been so ineffective ; but just the same every union that was ever
formed is as expression in some form of the class struggle
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I wish to emphasize the last statement of the
last speaker. He spoke of the wisdom of having an understanding
of this economic movement about to be launched, and the necessity
of depositing a Socialist ballot. If you remember, he said a
Socialist ballot. I agree with that. I also agree with him when I
believe he means to say that that ballot means a working class
political ballot. That means the working class and only the
working class. I agree with that. But I believe that that is to
be seen yet, and when a political organization will come before
the working people of America where it is pointed out that they
stand for the working class and only the working class, then will
be the time when the workingman will be able to deposit a
Socialist ballot.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: This report states that the workingman has a
right to study politics. I would rather that workingman should
have a chance to study economy. If he would study economy he
would have no need of politics. If he understands economy it will
mean the abolition of the parasites. Therefore, I say, let us not
say that he should study politics, but I would change the
expression that he should study real economy.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: We have lost sight of the subject in hand. I
would like to have the report read again.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will have the report read again.</p>
<p>Del. Dinger again read the report.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: Comrades, I am going to take up but a few minutes
of your time. I want to say to you that no matter what
disposition you make of this resolution, when I go out of this
convention I intend to exercise my right as an American citizen.
I intend to vote against the capitalist behind the judge. I
intend to vote against the capitalist behind the
policeman&rsquo;s club. I intend to vote against every politician
that is in favor of wage slavery. I intend to vote against the
buttress of the worst tyranny, the man behind the gun, and there
is nothing in this resolution that will stop me from doing that
thing. There has been a great deal said in this convention about
the American Federation of Labor. After I leave here I
don&rsquo;t propose to waste five minutes of my time talking
about the American Federation of Labor. I intend to go out and do
what I can to build up the industrial movement. (Applause). Let
the American Federation of Labor waste its time if it wants to
talking about this organization. But there are millions of men
who are outside of our organization and the American Federation
of Labor organization also, and it would be to our advantage to
reach out for them and let the American Federation of Labor go
the way it is going. Now, comrades, you see the electric motor
taking the place of the locomotive. You see the man in uniform
directing a train of cars with a simple crank. You see one weaver
doing the work of forty. Twenty years ago in Fall River there
were 2,000 spinners, and notwithstanding that great union that
they have there, made up of good loyal men, I have seen them on
strike, and the number of men has decreased in twenty years to
about 450 from 2,000, and the number of mills has increased about
twenty-eight. The inventor is undoing the American Federation of
Labor, and neither the American Federation nor any other power on
this planet can deal with this question in any other way than is
proposed by this organization here. And when we go outside let us
forget the American Federation of Labor. Let us keep this thing
in mind, that there are in the American Federation of Labor a lot
of good fellows, the rank and file; there are a lot of them. I
have seen those fellows from Fall River who belong to the
American Federation of Labor, with half an inch of snow on their
shoulders, tramping through the streets of the city of Providence
collecting dimes and cents to feed the strikers in Fall River. So
far as the officers are concerned, I have never bothered much
with them, and I don&rsquo;t propose to. The inventor is writing
the doom of such organizations as the American Federation of
Labor, and let him go on and do it. Let us attend to these
millions who have never been organized at all. Now, comrades, no
matter how long we discuss this matter of politics or no
politics,&mdash;it seems that we cannot get politics out of our
heads, this thing has got to go the way it is going. You
don&rsquo;t want to say to me when you go out of here that
because you are an industrial unionist you cannot exercise your
right as a citizen. Let us tell a man what we think it is best
for him to do on election day. And you don&rsquo;t want to
attempt to vote such resolutions as those down. That is what you
are trying to do. I do not think we can put this organization on
record in any better way than the way that is proposed, and what
is the use of going on all day talking about politics and
politics and politics?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Mr. President and Fellow Delegates, I wish to
say that if our foresight were equal to our hindsight there would
be no need of the introduction of such a resolution as I
understood from the reading is being introduced here. We have
gone through this entire matter in the adoption of the Preamble,
and if the foresight of the faction that wishes to continue this
wrangling in the convention were equal to their hindsight they
would see that the entire question has been done away with in the
adoption of our Preamble. If we are going to get down to
business, if we are going to confine ourselves to the serious,
practical problems that confront this convention, we are going to
do away with this wind-jamming, because I am going to tell you
that any man of average intelligence that is an attendant at this
convention understands just exactly what is meant. When we say
that we wish to form a class conscious organization, that
expresses it all. The different shades of opinion that are
necessarily brought together here and split hairs and talk for
hours upon the definition of a word or a phrase, are not going to
help the movement along. I have heard it said that the workers of
this country are ready for this movement. If the workers of this
country are ready for this movement, they are ready for the
movement; they are not ready for the hair-splitting definitions
that we are going to quibble on in this convention. (Applause).
Resolutions of this kind just introduced prolong debate. We are
all right from the time our Preamble was adopted; our Preamble
covers it all.</p>
<p>DEL. VOEGTLE: I think we ought to settle these points, because
every one wants them settled. The question is whether that
resolution is contradictory or whether it is not in regard to
political action. So I offer as an amendment, so you will not be
misunderstood and not go on record as being
contradictory&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just a moment, delegate. The motion is to refer.
Do you want to discuss that now?</p>
<p>DEL. VOEGTLE: Yes. My view of this matter is this: that
working class politics shall consist in the management of the
economic affairs of the working class on the political field,
without going into the capitalist halls of legislation to perform
acrobatic feats and reactionary performances in front of the
capitalists in trying to display our strength in their eyes,
because you can never gain anything through a bluff or through
loud talking, because, as Marx said, the capitalist state is the
executive committee of the capitalist class. We are up against
it. It is an economic question, and the working class wants to
recognize that politics is inherent in the economic power that
they hold as an economic organization, and that these go hand in
hand. If we think that we can gain political expression, that is,
wield political power, by going into the enemy&rsquo;s camp and
trying to outvote him, we are mistaken. Now, that resolution
seems to convey the impression that by hitching this economic
organization on to the Socialist party or the Socialist Labor
Party, that those long-haired phrase-mongers who are in those
parties will lead us on to emancipation. Now, we want to get rid
of that bogus idea and come right down on earth. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: I want to speak on the motion to refer. A motion
has been made to refer this matter to the committee</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No; to the incoming Executive Board.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: Well, to the incoming Executive Board. It should
be referred to some board or back to this committee, and as there
is no other motion, I will speak in favor of the motion that is
before the house. The document says that the United Workers is a
political organization or in favor of political activity or
something of that kind, and the term &ldquo;United Workers&rdquo;
is used as if that was going to be the name of the coming
organization. A little further on it uses the term
&ldquo;Industrial Workers&rdquo; as the name of the proposed
body. Those are errors, it seems to me, in that kind of a
document which we are about to adopt as an official declaration
of this convention. And then it contains some other errors, it
seems to me. Another statement contained in the paper is that no
official utterance of any industrial unions or industrial union
literature shall contain an endorsement of any political party or
anything of that kind. Now, the American Labor Union is an
industrial union organization organized on the principles of
industrial unionism, and it seems to me&mdash;I am pretty sure
that my recollection is correct&mdash;that in the preamble of the
A. L. U. they endorse the principles of international Socialism,
and that might be interpreted by some to be a political
pronouncement. Therefore, I hope that this question will either
be referred to this incoming committee or back to some other
committee to get the errors out of the document.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;BRIEN: I believe that this convention is facing
two positions, at least from the spirit of the discussion upon
this question, and these two positions are of very great
importance and have a direct relation to referring this question
to the incoming Executive Committee. These two questions, as they
appear to me, are simply these: On the one side it is a question
of making this organization a political organization, and on the
other it is a question of repudiating by implication or by direct
statement the question of politics. Now, it seems to me the
statement provided by the Literature and Press Committee is not
clear and distinct enough. It is neither a political marriage
with any existing political party nor is it an attempt to bring
out a political party as the result of this organization. And on
the other hand it does not repudiate any efforts of the working
class on the political field to better their conditions.
Accordingly I am in favor of referring this report.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I rise to a point of information. I would like to
know how we are to interpret the action on this report. Are we to
consider this motion to refer as repudiating the work of the
committee and to repudiate political action or not? We have had a
lot of arguments on one side and the other, and I would like to
ask the mover of the motion or the Chairman, what are we to
understand?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: It seems to me clear from the utterances of the
speakers that an article of that length should not be acted on at
one hearing. I have now heard it twice, and understood it better
the second time; but I would hesitate to act after reading it
only twice, just because it is so important. As far as I
understand the purport of it I believe I am in full sympathy with
it. But I know there are expressions there that you yourselves
(referring to the committee) will very likely expunge. The
Committee on Constitution has not adopted the name of United
Workers for this organization. They may adopt another name.
Suppose they do, are you going to reconsider the question? Are
you going to change the name? Another delegate mentioned some
other imperfection. The thing as a whole, it seems to me, is all
right, but if it is to be referred to a final committee for
further information on these details, to what is actually called
a committee on style, they would eliminate those imperfections. I
am in hearty accord with the thing itself, but I think we are not
in condition to adopt it as it is. We are not yet far enough
advanced in the convention. We might be to-morrow, and for that
reason if it was sent to the incoming G. E. B. that body will
find it necessary to issue as soon as possible its announcement
on the lines that have been promulgated by the Preamble. Have I
answered your question?</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I thank the gentleman for the answer. I am a
member of the committee, and it seems we have to act before going
to the Executive Committee. I want to make the point of order
then that the rest of the discussion is entirely out of order and
none of these questions are in order. I ask the chair to rule on
that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is that?</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I make the point of order that all discussion is
out of order on a matter of a mere correction of style. I want to
say that if the convention does not adopt the name that we put in
there we might as well leave the word blank. Under the
circumstances I make the point that all discussion on the
question of political action or non-political action is certainly
out of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I agree with you.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: As a member of the Committee on Literature and
Press I wish to say that the committee agreed to form three
sub-committees to state clearly and exactly the position of this
body, and from that standpoint I think that discussion on the
subject is proper now, because in order for the committee to do
its work it ought to have proper guidance. At the same time we do
not want to delay our work. The question with us was this, that
we should have a proper knowledge of exactly what was wanted, and
the committee drew up these lines for discussion, and if they
were eventually approved and printed, money must be used, whether
it was to be in the form of a small handbill, or four pages, or
whatever was found most practical and cheap, in order to explain
the position of this industrial union. Now, as far as politics
goes, in this latter part, I do not know how it came in here; it
came in without any knowledge of mine as a member of the
committee. They say that &ldquo;the United Workers in the
industrial union movement reserves the right for its members to
use outside of this labor organization in a political way any
weapon that will prove useful in the struggle for economic
betterment.&rdquo; Thus far I agree completely. But further on it
says, &ldquo;As organized workers we oppose every form of working
class ignorance, and urge all working people to study politics,
and advise all unions to set apart a time to study political
questions, to the end that when the working people use the ballot
their votes may be cast unitedly in their own interest.&rdquo;
Now, I have nothing against that, but since I do not believe in
the efficacy of the ballot&mdash;and to be honest with myself, I
never can get one&mdash;in this case it is something I never can
agree upon, although I recognize that those that think the ballot
is an effective weapon may do so. I would not oppose it, but from
my individual standpoint I do not use it as far as I am
individually concerned. Therefore I think that the whole matter
should be referred back to the Executive Board, so that whenever
we come to political questions they will come before the
Executive Board, and we will then have intelligence enough and be
broad enough to size up the proposition in the right way and take
proper action.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: This report of the Literature and Press
Committee calls attention to the charges made in the American
Federationist and other papers charging this organization with
trying to bring about another political organization, and also an
industrial organization with it. Now, I believe all of us are in
favor of endorsing the declaration to the effect that we are not
trying to bring into existence any political organization at all.
The committee also recommend that there be set aside a certain
portion of the time of the labor organizations for the purpose of
discussing political questions. I am heartily in favor of that
portion of the recommendation. I do not believe that this body is
ready to take the position of some who do not believe there is
any efficacy in the ballot. I believe nine-tenths of the people
still believe in the efficacy of the ballot, and that the labor
organizations will repudiate the idea that there is no efficacy
in the ballot, and if we do set apart a portion of the time for
the purpose of discussing political and economic questions we
will be able to educate them so that they will use their ballot
along with their economic methods, and it will not be a very long
while before we will be able to realize the emancipation of the
wage working class.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I simply want to correct a
misunderstanding that has appeared. It is said that this report
ought not to be adopted because it fixes a name for the
organization, and that that may be changed when the constitution
is adopted. As stated by a member of the Literature and Press
Committee, this name was used in the report simply because no
other name was at hand. I want to correct the person who said
that two different names were used&mdash;although it is
immaterial in the discussion. One name was used throughout. The
document refers to the industrial union movement, but wherever
the name United Workers occurs in this document it is as a name
favored for adoption by this organization as an industrial
union.</p>
<p>The previous question was then moved and carried.</p>
<p>The question on referring the document to the incoming
Executive Board was then put. The result of a viva voce vote
being in doubt, the Chairman called for a raising of hands, and
the motion was declared carried by a vote of 35 to 29.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Will you accept a motion at this stage,
&ldquo;With a recommendation that they act promptly upon
it&mdash;the Executive Board&rdquo;? If you think it would arouse
debate I will take my seat.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I don&rsquo;t think any action on that is
required.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: All right.</p>
<h4>RATIFICATION MEETING.</h4>
<p>Del. Held, on behalf of the Ways and Means Committee, reported
back Resolution No. 2, heretofore printed, providing for a
ratification meeting not later than July 7th.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: The report of the Ways and Means Committee is as
follows: Your committee recommend that you concur in the
resolution, and recommend that the convention select a special
committee whose duty it shall be to carry out the sense of the
resolution.</p>
<p>On motion the report was concurred in.</p>
<p>Del. Held, from the Ways and Means Committee, also reported
back Resolution No. 9, on the subject of providing a system of
commercial co-operation, with the following recommendation:</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Your committee report that this resolution does not
come within the sphere of the Ways and Means Committee, and
recommend that the resolution be referred to the Committee on
Constitution.</p>
<p>On motion, the report was concurred in and the resolution
referred to the Committee on Constitution.</p>
<h4>COMMITTEE ON RATIFICATION MEETING</h4>
<p>DEL. HELD: I move that a committee of five be appointed by the
chair, whose duty shall be to carry out the sense of Resolution
No. 2.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A committee of five to provide for this public
meeting?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Yes.</p>
<p>Motion seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I want to say to the convention that the method
of appointing committees is provided for. The rules provide that
all committees of this convention shall be selected by the
various groups, with three appointed by the chair.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: That is standing committees, is it not?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It says &ldquo;all committees.&rdquo; Unless
there is some objection the chair will entertain this motion for
this special committee. Is there any objection?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I move that it be the sense of this convention
that the chair be allowed to appoint this committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If there is no objection the motion will be put
before the house, that a special committee of five be selected by
the chair to arrange this meeting. Are there any remarks on the
motion? All those in favor will say aye. Contrary no. It is
carried. The chair will attempt to announce the committee pretty
soon.</p>
<h4>POLITICAL ACTION</h4>
<p>The Secretary then read Resolution No. 21, submitted by
Delegate Chas. Kiehn, of Hoboken, N. J.:</p>
<p>Whereas, The aim and object and purpose of this organization
should be to unite the organized working class into one economic
organization for the purpose of gaining ultimate complete
emancipation for the working class from wage and all other forms
of slavery; therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That the members of this organization who
participate in political action are also expected to support
daily such political parties as stand unconditionally for the
absolute overthrow of the existing capitalistic system of society
and the inauguration of a co-operative system of production and
distribution; and be it further</p>
<p>Resolved, That support by members of this organization of
political parties which do not stand for the principles of this
organization as above enumerated shall be deemed treason to the
most vital interests of this organization and to the working
class in general.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: I move that that be tabled. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The proper course is to send that to the
committee. I will send this to the Committee on Resolutions. I
was just going to say this would be covered pretty much by the
Committee on Literature and Press, and I will send it to the
Committee on Literature and Press.</p>
<h4>BUTTE RESOLUTIONS</h4>
<p>The Secretary read the following resolutions from the Butte,
Mont., local of the Socialist party:</p>
<p>Whereas, A convention of unionists is now in session in the
city of Chicago, whose purpose as expressed is to build an
economic organization of the working class, to build an
industrial union founded on the class struggle, in which to bring
about the solidarity of labor on the industrial field and the
inauguration of the workers&rsquo; republic; therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That Butte Local of the Socialist party extends
congratulations to said convention and urge that the delegates
now assembled in Chicago be alive to the responsibility resting
upon them; that they spare no effort to so construct the new
organization that it shall avoid the errors of the pure and
simple craft unions now making up a greater part of the organized
labor movement in America, and that the new union may be able to
take care of the economic and ultimate interests of the entire
working class of this country.</p>
<p>Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the
aforesaid industrial union convention in Chicago, that another
copy be placed on file in this organization, and that a copy be
furnished each of the daily papers of Butte for publication.</p>
<p>(Adopted at a regular meeting of the Butte Socialist
party.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is simply in the nature of a
communication.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: It is brought in as a resolution.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: No, it is simply a communication.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The communication will be received and placed on
file.</p>
<p>The following communication was read</p>
<p>F. J. U.&mdash;102.</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill., July 3rd, 1905.</p>
<p>To the Officers and Delegates, Industrial Union, Brand&rsquo;s
Hall,</p>
<p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>Gentlemen and Brothers:&mdash;Whereas, A Manifesto has been
issued by certain members, men and women, to form an Industrial
Union based on economic lines, to the betterment and emancipation
of the working class; and</p>
<p>Whereas, Said Manifesto has been duly approved by Flat
Janitors&rsquo; Union, No. 102, Chicago Flat janitors; therefore,
be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That our delegates to the Industrial Convention are
instructed to do all in their power to make this convention a
success, and our fearless order is, to work against plutocracy,
creed and popery; and, be it further</p>
<p>Resolved, That our delegates are empowered to install this
organization as a drop into the sea of workingmen and women; and,
be it further</p>
<p>Resolved, That our wish and order is: Go and multiply thousand
folds; and, be it further</p>
<p>Resolved, That the secretary of this organization is directed
to forward this resolution to the convention.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>GEO. A. NEW MILLER, Sec&rsquo;y.</p>
<p>Local No. 102, Chicago Flat Janitors.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>GEO. A. NEW MILLER, ANDREW ANDERSON,</p>
<p>Delegates.</p>
<p>Received and filed.</p>
<h4>MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.</h4>
<p>The Secretary then read a resolution (No. 22) handed in by
delegates from the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club of Chicago,
reading as follows:</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 22.</h4>
<p>Whereas, 1. Owing to the fact that the legislatures of certain
States have passed bills making it a misdemeanor for workingmen
to persuade or attempt to persuade other workingmen from joining
Military Organizations; and</p>
<p>Whereas, 2. We, as united workers, recognize that Patriotism
is one of the cardinal virtues, and should be inculcated into the
minds of all those having their country&rsquo;s interests at
heart; and</p>
<p>Whereas, 3. It is a well-known fact that a well trained
Regiment is superior to ten thousand not so trained, and military
training would be absolutely indispensable to the property
interests of the country in the face of a foreign invasion ;
and</p>
<p>Whereas, 4. By emulating the example of our beloved President
it is possible for any among us to attain to the same exalted
position ; and</p>
<p>Whereas, 5. A contingency might even arise in which such
training, and the membership in such an organization might be of
value to the workingman, as a workingman; therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this organization that its
members affiliate at once with the different State Military
Bodies, and that they also show their loyalty to the present
government by persuading all brother members to do likewise.</p>
<p>BERT M. SAUER,</p>
<p>Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club, No. 1, Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>The reading of the resolution was greeted with derisive
laughter.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: I did not read over that resolution (the
resolution of the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club) before reading
it to the convention.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Who is that from? The Typographical Union?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: That should be referred to the Literature
and Press Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Refer it to the Fire Marshal.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will ask the Secretary to consign it to the
waste basket. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I rise to object to the autocratic decision of
the President in asking the Secretary to consign that resolution
to the waste basket.</p>
<p>A delegate rose to make a point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you want to make a motion now?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I want to make a motion, yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: All right.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I want to move that that resolution be referred
to some committee, I care not which, but that it be reported back
to this convention. If I were to have my say, I should say the
Resolution Committee. Now, Mr. President.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there a second to the motion?</p>
<p>The motion was seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Let me ask you, delegate, did you introduce the
resolution?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: No, sir, I did not.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just a moment. Let us find out. Is the delegate
on the floor that introduced this resolution?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUER: I introduced the resolution.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I thought it was handed in from outside.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Now, Mr. President, if you will permit me just
a minute&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion before the house is that this
communication be considered by the convention and sent to the
proper committee.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Correct. I want to say, Mr.
President&mdash;</p>
<p>A delegate rose to a point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: To save any talk I will refer it to the
Resolution Committee. Is there any further new business? Any
other business before the convention? If there is no other
business&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I would like to ask, if you have power, after a
motion is made, to refer this matter to a committee without
action, haven&rsquo;t you the power to take it away from the
convention? I consider that motion now before the house, and I
want to discuss it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It was simply to correct the error of the chair
that it was not referred to the committee in the first place. As
I understood the comrade back here, it came from the outside, but
it seems it came from a delegate. I did that, referred it, so
that the chair could correct its own mistake. Is there any other
business before the house? I would like to have some suggestions
on this ratification committee.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I suggest that Chicago delegates be appointed
upon that committee.</p>
<p>A number of names were suggested by various delegates.</p>
<h4>COMMITTEE ON RATIFICATION MEETING.</h4>
<p>THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, COATES: The chair will appoint as the
special committee to arrange the meeting as provided for in this
resolution just adopted, Delegates O. M. Held, Daniel McDonald,
W. J. Bradley, John Cranston, Guy N. Miller.</p>
<p>Del. Jorgensen suggested that the proposed meeting be so
arranged as to reach the organized workingmen of Chicago
especially, those not belonging to organizations not being so
important to reach at the present time.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;BRIEN: In connection with the matter referred to
the Executive Board a little while ago, I wish to move, in order
to place the matter before the house, that in the event the
Executive Board finds the report of the Press Committee needs
correction or amendment, it present us an alternative report or
alternative statement.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: It has a right to.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is within their power to do that.</p>
<p>There being no further business, the Chairman declared the
convention adjourned until nine o&rsquo;clock July 4th.</p>
