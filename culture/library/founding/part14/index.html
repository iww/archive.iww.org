<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>EIGHTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Wednesday, July 5</h3>
<h3>AFTERNOON SESSION</h3>
<p>The convention met at one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: When the convention adjourned we had under
discussion the amendment offered by Delegate Coates to Section 2,
Article 1. Delegate Simons has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I am not one of those that think that the
organization is going to go to wreck and ruin if either side
prevails here, but I do feel that there are a few things that
incline me to support the amendment, and I hope that what I have
to say will be put in such a way that it will apply directly to
the question in hand. It seems to me as if a great deal of talk
on this subject has taken the universe for a field and humanity
for a theme, and bears little relation to the matter under
discussion. Questions have been asked and generalities have been
gone into and different conclusions have been drawn, with but
little connection between the generalities and the conclusions.
There has been a great deal of the sort of argument that the
capitalists use when they tell you that the Declaration of
Independence is an inspired document, and that the constitution
was handed down directly from heaven, and therefore that they
ought not to pay their laborers more than 50 cents a day. There
has been a lack of connection. We are all agreed absolutely on
the fact that we want to secure a greater solidarity in working
class organization; that we want to reflect in the organization
that may come from here the solidarity that is taking place on
the industrial field. We are all agreed that trade lines have
been all but entirely wiped out. We are all agreed that the
lowest man needs the fight the worst; not simply equal to, but
needs the fight more than the man who is in the highly skilled
trade. We are all agreed upon these things. But now the question
comes up as to how to get the application of the views of the
committee and of a majority affecting these questions. Now, when
I first saw that chart, I was impressed, as I think every one was
who has noticed, with its value for propaganda, with the skillful
way in which it was presented and the large number of facts it
contained. But I never dreamed that we were going to come to a
time when that chart was to become a fetich and that we should
accept it instead of the facts. I had no idea that the complex
society of to-day could be drawn and illustrated upon this chart
so as to express all the facts that we want to express in our
organization here. Then this amendment came up, and it has been
stated upon the floor of this convention that to-day the American
working class was divided among 127 different divisions. Those
divisions of to-day they propose to recombine by another method.
They propose to add thirteen more. No, they do not simply propose
to add those thirteen, but it is proposed to split the 127 rather
up and down this way, and then we propose to crosshatch then with
thirteen more, making 13 times 127 sections in which we propose
to split the working class of America to-day. I supposed we were
going to come here to form an industrial union. There is not a
line upon that chart, as we can see, that provides for
organization by industries. That is an organization by
departments, if it is anything. Moreover, those departments, I
believe&mdash;and I believe it has been pointed out here over and
over again&mdash;instead of being found in the industrial field
and transferred to the chart, they were created in the brains of
the committee, and then they seek to impose that upon us as a
picture of the industrial field. One comrade told us here that if
we overturned this position it would destroy the entire work of
the committee. Let me tell you that when your committee attempts
to go contrary to the industrial facts, those industrial facts
will tear that committee and this organization all to pieces. The
thing for us to do here is to look into the industrial relations
as they are, and reflect them in our organization. Now, then,
what are the conditions? Those industrial relations to-day, as we
are to set them forth in our organization, as they have been set
forth by every speaker upon this floor, are to the effect that
the men that are working in one line of industry have common
interests. There is nothing whatever in the plan that at all
applies to the position that Comrade Sherman took and numerous
other delegates here, that the men that work for the Pennsylvania
Railroad were going to be split into 50 or 500 different
divisions. On the contrary, those men are in one industry, and
the amendment specifically says &ldquo;industries.&rdquo; It
proposes that they should be so organized. The thing that we have
got to do here is to make our organization fit the industrial
situation as it is to-day, not as we happen to consider it in
some beautiful picture of things that we would like to see some
time in the future. When we go out from here we are not going to
be bothered about 127 organizations, standing ready to jump into
this and divide us all up. We are not going to have at the utmost
more than ten or eleven industries that would be in a position to
organize. Now, I want to call your attention to something that
this means. This means that with the organizations as they are
to-day, that the men in any one of those departments where we
have a union to-day it may go in there and adopt the name of that
department and seize the machinery of that department. It means
that a little handful of men can control the machinery of that
department and keep up such a hubbub within it as to keep all
opposition out and those half dozen men can wield exactly the
same power within the central council as the same number of men
that might represent fifty or a hundred thousand men in some
industry that was fully organized. It simply gives an opportunity
for the capture of the machinery by a handful of men in those
different departments. There is another side to it. It is said
that this amendment opened up the road to the adoption of the A.
F. of L. form of organisation. Don&rsquo;t you believe it. This
method is an absolutely superior method, and I will tell you why;
because the object of this is to represent industries, not
trades. The chart represents arbitrary divisions, just exactly
the same as we say of the men who are the vice-presidents of the
American Federation of Labor at the present time. And you are
proposing to duplicate the American Federation of Labor Council
when you adopt that chart as it stands there to-day.</p>
<p>Again, as Delegate De Leon told us, we must recognize the time
element in this proposition. But again it was a generality from
which I believe he drew the wrong conclusion. It seems to me it
is more sensible, when we have an industry organized, to adopt
that industry and organize it on industrial lines, and then when
the time comes for more industries to go in, for more trades to
come into that industry, that then we begin to let those
industries grow together till the time comes to form an
industrial department. That is the point we have got to keep in
mind all the way through this.</p>
<p>Now as suggested at the beginning, I do not think things are
going to ruin whichever way we vote on this. But I have no desire
to force the industrial organization of this country into a sort
of departmental chart like that, corresponding in no way to the
facts. They have taken one of those divisions and crosshatched it
in a dozen different ways which have no relation to the facts as
they are to-day. And besides, it seems that when they had got
twelve of those, they had to make an unlucky thirteenth and label
it the waste basket and throw everything else into it that they
could not fit anywhere else along the line, and with nothing
corresponding to the facts as they are to-day. And so I say to
you that if you adopt this report of the committee, you will tear
to pieces not simply the work of the committee, but you will tear
to pieces the organization that you are to found, or rather
industrial development will tear it to pieces for you. Now,
however much we may not like it, we must recognize the facts in
the industrial world. There are tremendous facts that we cannot
leave out of consideration. So I wish that those who are to speak
after me would argue from that standpoint. I want to call the
attention of some of these men to the fact that this plan as
proposed cuts crosswise across all the 127 divisions of one
department and jumbles them together, not in relation to the
facts, but in relation to schemes that are of no moment. And
second, it enables a mere handful of men to represent one of
those divisions, so that if there are half a dozen men organized
in the, carpenter trade, we will say, then they represent the
department of building, and those men have control of the
machinery of that entire department. Again, that they have laid
down a plan that is going to duplicate the A. F. of L. by making
divisions arbitrary and electing men that represent nothing in
the heavens above or earth beneath but simply the control of
those organizations. And finally, that they have absolutely
neglected the time element in the fact that they are endeavoring
to create something that is inconsistent with present development
in the trades. I ask you to take those facts and look them over,
and if you find that they are sound I ask you to vote for the
amendment. If not, I would like to have it pointed out wherein
they are not sound.</p>
<p>DEL. TRAUTMANN: Comrade Chairman: I have only a few words to
say. When the conference met in January and mapped out the
Manifesto or program it was well understood that the eleven
original departments of industry should have a right to subdivide
into industrial groupings or industrial divisions, under the
direction of the advisory board or with the consent of all the
different groupings making up that respective department. Now, I
hold that it is the sense and I believe it is the sense of the
committee that such trades shall be preserved by industrial
departments. For instance, take department No. 13. It comprises
various groupings, but we see for instance there is the street
sweeper classed together with the printer. But at the same time
it does not prevent the department administration or the
department advisory board, or whatever it may be in the future,
from grouping the printers in a separate division of the
department as outlined in the diagram. The parks, highways,
municipal sanitary department, and so on, would form industrial
divisions of that department. The Constitution Committee could
not lay down iron rules, and I do not believe that they have
intended to lay down arbitrary rules and force men to go into the
groupings as outlined in the Manifesto. We only represent a
skeleton within an organization. We believe that the rank and
file will discuss the various subjects discussed at this
convention, and will discuss the form of organization as
intelligently as they have discussed the Manifesto, and the heads
in that locality will perhaps advise how the groupings should be
made, and the industrial formation will be formulated later on at
a coming convention. The Constitution Committee has not laid down
iron rules to say that you must go into a group. Now, I am, say,
a flint glass-worker. The Amalgamated Glass Workers, by the form
of organization, by the rules in the constitution, will be forced
to come together and form one industrial grouping, and the
Amalgamated Glass Worker and any worker in a glass factory will
have his representative and his vote on the advisory board or
executive committee, whatever it may be. That right has been
given to the industrial department, to run their own affairs in
compliance with the general rules of this organization. And I am
satisfied that if Section 2 of the constitution is adopted, it
will preserve the industrial groupings, and they certainly have a
right to decide for themselves in what department they belong and
as to what would be the best form of administration for the
particular division of a given department. The suggestion of
Delegate Coates simply means that we will have about 120
industrial unions within this organization, and 120 industrial
unions would claim representation on the general executive board.
You will have every day and every week a sort of convention and
you will be discussing and never will come to a conclusion. I am
satisfied that if you adopt the proposed constitution as
submitted by the committee and allow the rank and file of the
organizations attached to this organization to discuss the faults
and the good points of the constitution, that in the next
convention we will be able perhaps to outline a better
constitution and make better groupings or put the members
together as may suit best those who are connected with the
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Delegate Simons stated that this chart
splits the workers into thirteen times the number of
international crafts mentioned by Brother Sherman. If that is
true, it splits them in every department. Let us take the
department of mining as at present illustrated in the Western
Federation of Miners. I notice a great many people are getting
&ldquo;cold feet&rdquo; about this chart, falling into line with
Gompers in calling it a zodiac. This chart did not originate at
least in that department of the brains of the committee as a sort
of pipe dream, as is intimated. It follows the groupings of the
men in that particular union or industrial organization, economic
organization. The Western Federation of Miners is more than an
industrial union: it is an economic union. The United Mitchell
workers, as Pat O&rsquo;Neil would call them, are an industrial
organization, but they are not an economic organization. They are
industrial in form. That is, they claim jurisdiction over every
man working in and around the mines, but they recognize a
community of interest between the capitalist class and the
working class. They live by the sufferance of the coal operators,
as a joke upon the system. Yet they are in industrial
organization. They are, in so far as the organization itself is
concerned, in conspiracy with the coal operators. The Western
Federation of Miners is not split up, notwithstanding the false
statement of Delegate Simons. It is not split but multiplied by
the fact that it is the Western Federation of Miners. When you
see a man with the three-starred button on in a western camp, you
do not ask him if he is a marker, if he is a timber man or an
assaying man, if he is a blacksmith or a mill or smelterman, or a
solution man. The thing that is emphasized is that button. The
thing that is biggest in that button, the thing of which it is
the symbol in the Western Federation of Miners, is that that man
is a member of the working class so far as it is organized in the
mining industry. Never, in all my experience in the mining camps
of the west, have I ever yet seen or met any sharpening of any
craft distinctions in the Western Federation of Miners. The fact
that for the sake of clearness for the workers who read this
chart we state the different kinds of work, does not mean that we
split them up into that many kinds of workers. The fact that is
emphasized in that chart is that we give the economic
grouping.</p>
<p>Now, Brother Simons says that this chart does not reflect
present social conditions. He makes a broad, blunt assertion,
without any proof whatsoever. I think sufficient proof or
suggestive proof has been offered before in these discussions as
to the economic groupings, and there is hardly any need of my
going into that again. We might mention for illustration the
department of transportation to-day as it is organized. It is not
simply railroads or small railroads; it is practically the
department of transportation. If you read the Railway Age, which
is practically the official journal of the railway interests of
this country, you will find that eighty per cent. of the
transportation of this country is controlled by five groups of
capitalists. As Marx has well put it, the historical tendency of
capitalistic accumulation, the drift into fewer and fewer hands,
is to-day entering its final stage of concentration, the
centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer
hands. When the teamsters in the city of Chicago went to the Fair
and Siegel &amp; Cooper to get an individual settlement before
they struck, they got the answer, &ldquo;Go to our chairman, Mr.
Farwell, of the Employers&rsquo; Association of Chicago.&rdquo;
The employers in the Manufacturers&rsquo; Association, for
example, cover that entire sweep of the department of
Manufactures in their relations with the working class, and they
fight as one organization within that department of manufacture.
They do not fight as wood working manufacturers, or as furniture
manufacturers, or as metal manufacturers. They fight as the
Manufacturers&rsquo; Association, as a particular economic
grouping in society to-day. And it is to my thinking merely a
begging of the question for Comrade&mdash;or Delegate
rather&mdash;Simons to get up on this floor and to say that this
committee evolved this thing simply out of their inner
consciousness; that it does not reflect anything; that it is a
mere arbitrary arrangement; that it does not reflect present
economic conditions. He does not prove that it does not at all.
He simply makes the broad statement. He says moreover that we are
all agreed about solidarity. Let him speak for himself; I do not
think we are at this stage of the game. If we were we would agree
about an economic organization of the working class and not a
splitting up of the workers into a hundred or 500 international
and national industrial unions. (Applause.) The word
&ldquo;industrial&rdquo; is capable of many interpretations. In
every one of those departments there might, at a low estimate, be
fifty industries which could properly be classed as industries;
not as economic groupings, but as industries. At that rate we
would simply have an enlargement of the A. F. of L. with a fine
rhetorical Preamble stating that we believe in the class
struggle, although in practice we are going to split up the
workers as much as possible and let the capitalists play hell
with them. (Applause). Comrade&mdash;or Delegate
rather&mdash;Delegate Simons states that ten or fifteen men could
get together in a department and take the name of a department
and capture the power of that department. If he had listened to
the report of the constitution submitted by this Constitution
Committee he would not make that statement. The constitution
expressly guards against any such a state of affairs. The
Executive Board elected by this convention or by this
organization has the power to specify and classify. It is not
going to have six carpenters constitute the department of
building. The department of building is not constituted until at
least a majority of the different building trades are organized
in a department of building. He says that this chart is simply
the A. F. of L. Samuel Gompers says the same thing. (Applause).
In fact, he has got out a chart very much like this to prove that
it is the A. F. of L.&mdash;the zodiac and all other kind of
things. The A. F. of L. is built on the craft principle. This
chart outlines an economic organization from economic groupings
of industries. There is all the difference between the antipodes
between this proposed form of organization and the American
Federation of Labor, which splits up the workers in a department
of industry; in the department of building, the carpenter, the
hod carrier, the painter, the paper hanger, the plumber, the
tinner, the electrician, the glazier, the roofer&mdash;all belong
to exactly the same economic groupie to the same organization
governed by the same economic laws within that organization and
working within that organization. To-day the A. F. of L, which
Delegate Simons says is the same as this chart, in the building
industry is exactly the opposite. The brick layers in the city of
Chicago, in their union, agree that if in the future men want to
go out on strike when scab lumber is hauled to the building they
will have permission of the union to do so as individuals. As a
matter of fact the carpenters, many of them in the city of
Chicago, worked with scab lumber hauled to the building under
protection from deputy sheriffs and police in this strike. And I
submit to the intelligence of the assembled delegates here that
there is no parity between men organized in an economic group in
the building industry and the crafts of the building industry
where one trade can stay within the full spirit and letter and
content of the American Federation of Labor and scab upon another
craft within the same building industry. And any one here who
understands the structure of the American Federation of Labor
will not agree with Delegate Simons that this chart is just
exactly the same as the American Federation of Labor and splits
the workers up just as the American Federation of Labor splits
them up. It is not designed to split them up. It is designed to
bring them together in easy relationship in their economic
matters, to deal with those matters with a wise, intelligent
economic grouping of the power of that working class. To-day
capitalist society, notwithstanding the general, unproved,
unsupported and uncorroborated statements of Delegate Simons, the
capitalist class is organised in a capitalist society, in
exploitation, and organized according to certain well-known
economic groupings. There may be lines where they cross. There
may be political borders and boundaries, but the main groupings
stand out clear and strong. We have to-day a department of
mining, a mining industry.</p>
<p>An interruption.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I have the floor, and you will have your time to
talk after I get through.</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the interrupting delegate be
required to keep still or be put out.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: The delegate states that this chart was evolved
out of the brain of the committee, or this grouping, without
relation to the facts as they exist. I think that that committee
did not evolve, and I as one of the committee know that so far as
I am concerned we did not evolve this simply as a fanciful
scheme. But we had in mind to give, so far as we could at this
present provisional stage of organization, the main groupings of
industries as they are to-day. He refers to the superstitious
thirteen. Politicians nowadays are very superstitious.
(Applause). It is a waste basket, he says; a waste basket for all
the others, all the left-over goods of the other departments. In
support of number thirteen we have a duplicate in the culinary
trades of Switzerland, one of the most highly organized,
economic, revolutionary unions in the world, or in continental
Europe, organized exactly along those same lines; an industrial,
economic organization of the various workers unions in the
culinary trades; even larger than that thirteenth division,
taking in even the groups here, the brewery, wine and distillery
workers, including the tobacco workers, the flour mill workers,
sugar refineries, and so on up to and inclusive of brewery, wine
and distillery workers. So that we are not making a leap in the
air or evolving something out of the over-heated imagination of
the Constitution Committee, but we have already before us facts
and the experience of other workingmen. Much as we may wave the
flag of American superiority and supremacy, I want to tell you
that our continental fellow-workers, with whom we shall soon be
in international, world-wide, revolutionary, economic
relationship through this organization if it starts out right,
have had the experience that we have not had. They have already
organized on these lines. Only last month in Spain a congress was
held in Madrid which issued a manifesto somewhat longer than this
Manifesto; a manifesto summing up five years&rsquo; experience in
the experiment that we are about to make. Five years ago in Spain
an organization formed along the same lines as this is devised to
be formed along, was organized in Madrid, and this manifesto is a
summing tip of the five years&rsquo; struggle and experience of
that organization, and it has been demonstrated to be a success
along economic lines, along industrial lines and against craft
division, against multiplying the workers into national and
international small industries that split up their forces, that
decentralize their administration, that complicate the processes
of their struggle with the employing class. I hold that that
amendment is destructive of the entire principle of economic,
revolutionary organization of the working class (applause); that
it would simply be a mere reform upon the American Federation of
Labor, which to-day under economic pressure is groping in more or
less industrial ways. The Typographical Union is ceasing more and
more to be a craft union and is broadening out its jurisdiction.
It to-day assumes jurisdiction over the machinists, over the
linotype operators. It is working toward jurisdiction over other
departments within the printing industry itself. And yet that
International Typographical Union is, while becoming industrial
in form, not an economic organization of the working class. In
the St. Louis convention one of the delegates stood on the floor
and said, &ldquo;Lives there a man with soul so dead who never,
to himself hath said, this is my own, my native Land?&rdquo; And
then they took up the military resolution. And in some of the
Colorado bull pens the soldiers that were guarding the Western
Federations of Miners &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; had Typographical
Union cards in their pockets. (Applause). We do not want
industrial organizations of that sort. We want the workers
grouped according to the structure of the capitalistic industries
themselves. We do not claim as a committee that that grouping is
correct, is fixed, is immovable, but that at the present stage it
is the nearest reflection we can get of those capitalist
groupings of industry, as nearly as we can represent them. It is
not designed to tie the progress of the working class, of the
economic, revolutionary organization of the workers. It is not a
crystal. It does not put any hindrances in the way of broader
development and closer coming together in a more and more organic
solidarity. It simply was designed as a basis for the present
condition of organization work. And I submit that the amendment
itself and the spirit of the amendment are absolutely against the
Preamble of this proposed organization, and against the whole
economic structure, if properly built, of a revolutionary working
class organization of the world-wide toilers, of the world-wide
workers. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. GUY MILLER: Mr. Chairman and Delegates of the Convention:
I deprecate the introduction of personalities that to some extent
has disfigured this discussion, for to me every man who has a
seat in this convention, by that fact is entitled to recognition
as a comrade in the world-wide army for the industrial
emancipation of the working class. And so I recognize Delegate
Coates and Delegate Simons and Delegate Sherman and Delegate
Hagerty as comrades who may differ in their ideas as to the form
and meaning of this proposed constitution, but who are united in
a common purpose. It seems to me that the discussion that has
taken place here is a conflict between forms of expression and
not between ideas, and I believe that the Constitutional
Committee, with all due deference to their ability, have been
unfortunate in their choice of terms, since there seems to be
such a wide variance of opinion as to the meaning of the proposed
constitution. I think we all realize&mdash;our presence on the
floor is prima facie proof at any rate that we realize&mdash;the
industrial solidarity of the working class. Every man who
understands the spirit of the Manifesto knows that every line
drawn on that chart there is an arbitrary line and not an organic
one; an attempt to picture forth an idea. And ideas cannot be
pictured. The people who take that chart as a sort of fetich are
liable to find a mudhole of misunderstanding in it. It is an
attempt to diagram forth the work of this committee, and I know
perfectly well that Comrade Coates in his amendment and the
Constitutional Committee in that section which they have drafted
are aiming at precisely the same thing. And if I have succeeded
in understanding the men who have entered into an exposition of
the work of the Constitution Committee, everything that Delegate
Coates&rsquo;s amendment provides for is already secured in the
work of the Constitution Committee. In other words, this
convention goes on record as recognizing the craft autonomy and
the industrial unity of the working class of this country. One of
the delegates, one of the comrades who addressed the convention
shortly before Delegate Sherman, said that we were willing to
throw aside all that education and experience had taught the
workers of this country. To do so would be nothing less than a
crime to the men whom we claim to represent here. We want to take
into our consideration every fact that has been brought out in
the struggles of the past. We must also consider that the
organizations in existence at the present time are to some extent
a product of industrial evolution. They have a meaning, and it is
our business to interpret that meaning and explain it in such a
way that the workers in factory, mine and mill everywhere shall
realize that we understand the meaning of those facts. The form
of organization is the result of industrial evolution. Now, it
seems to me that in meeting the idea of the concentration of
capital the organization of the industrial movement had to some
extent overlooked another fact, a corresponding fact, that to
some men might seem to be in opposition to it, but really is
united with it. In other words, Mr. Chairman, this is an age of
specialization as well as concentration, and if I understand the
meaning of this Manifesto we are to apply that principle in the
organization of the working class of the country, to get down out
of the realm of principles into the every-day world; in other
words, a printer is very much better fitted to discuss and to
consider the problems confronting the printing industry of the
country than the man engaged at work in the laundry or in the
park. We are not so foolish as to overlook or underestimate the
importance of that fact. So the proposed industrial organization
is to provide for the organization of the printers even into
various craft organizations of that highly specialized industry.
But remember, at the same time we provide also for industrial
unity, because this convention emphasizes the idea of the
essential unity of the working class of the world, and the only
way in which their interests can be perfectly protected is to
unite the power of the entire body of the working class in
support of the position of the workers at any particular point in
the field. We should be insane to do less than that. The
specialization of industry is a principle, I repeat, which, if
this organization is going to keep step with progress, it must
take carefully into account. The fact that we are able to
accomplish so much more to-day in every field than in any other
age, is owing to the fact that there are a few men devoting all
their energies, their time, their talents, to the solution of
particular problems; problems belonging to a small department of
industry. I think I may be excused if I take an excursion off at
the present time in illustrating matters of this kind. For
instance, in the agricultural department a scientist in the last
year or two has made an improvement in corn and made a difference
of one hundred million bushels to the farmers of Iowa. Another
scientist in the chemical department was making investigations in
his particular department or bureau, and another scientist in his
particular bureau. There was the same spirit directing all those
highly specialized industries. Behind each of them there was the
capitalist system and the capitalist mind directing the energies
of the whole. In the discussion this forenoon one of the comrades
made mention of the fact that it was the capitalist behind the
newspaper and the capitalist behind the railway industry. It is
true enough. There is the capitalist system behind each one, but
the capitalist uses the men who understand the railway business
to direct the railways of this country, and he uses the men who
understand the conduct of newspapers to direct the conduct of his
newspapers. And we, if we are intelligent men, will not be a bit
behind that capitalist in the realization of the problem of the
working class and in directing our organization so as to meet and
solve those problems. And so for the mining industry, the Western
Federation of Miners, if you please; at the head of that
organization there will be a man who is in direct touch with the
mining industry of the country. The same thing will be true of
the metal workers, the tobacco workers, or any other line of
workers that may form a part of this new industrial organization.
We must not overlook the fact&mdash;I do not believe it can be
emphasized too much or too often&mdash;the fact that the workers
in any particular department or industry are best fitted to solve
the problems in that particular department. And after they have
brought the best intelligence they possess to the solution of
those problems that solution will be backed by the entire
strength of the working class, the men engaged in every
department of industry. I have felt all along in the discussion
of the problems of this convention, that while you were
considering the problem of concentration and central
administration, you did not recognize to a sufficient extent the
principle of democracy as well&mdash;the right of the workers in
all the various departments, to solve their own particular
problems. I want to tell you that the concentration of affairs
and the organization of industry must proceed along these two
lines. While it gives increased power, that increased power must
be directed for the benefit of the working class, and not for a
few highly specialized and organized industries. The trouble with
the American Federation of Labor and their system of organization
in the past is that they have never realized the class struggle;
there has never been an honest attempt to organize the workers
and present the full force and power of their organization at
every point where the capitalist system came in conflict with it.
Capitalism is so highly organized at the present time that you
finally come to its expression in the person of a single man.
That man might well be a Rockefeller who would stand for the oil
fields, for the railway fields, for the banks, the manufacturing
industries for all that civilization stands for at the present
time; and through his spokesmen he presents the position of
organized dollars. We must organize the working class in all the
wide ramifications of industry until before that cool, magnetic
individual there stands a person who in his own individuality
stands for the interests of the world of united workers, and
against the organization of united dollars presents the power of
an organization of united men. (Applause). That, I take it, is
what this organization is to secure. That I have understood to be
the exposition of the Constitutional Committee. That is precisely
what is provided for in the groupings of these various
industries, in the work which will confront the organizer when he
goes out over the country and presents this plan of organization
to the workers. Remember, we must take into consideration not
only industrialism, but human nature as well; we must show that
this organization provides for the control of these various
departments to a certain extent by the workers engaged in those
departments. I have been told on this floor, Mr. Chairman, that
industry was rapidly tending to a point at which the arbitrary
division between the skilled workers and the unskilled workers
was being wiped out by the machine. That is absolutely true, and
we all agree with that. But I want to inform you that if you jump
over the intervening space of time, if you seek to make this
association accept and anticipate a fact that will take twenty
years to realize, you bring this organization into existence
twenty years ahead of its time. It is unable to solve the
problems that confront it to-day. The problem that is before us
to-day is to bring into the world an organization in absolute
harmony with the facts as they exist at the present time. If we
do that, the finger of shame is impressed deep on every form of
industrial evolution at the present moment, and our organization
will bear the imprint of that finger of shame. Let us be ready
and able to change its organization in correspondence with the
facts of industrial life. It is no compliment to an organization
or to a man to insist that the form of organization is ahead of
its time. That is the severest censure that can be laid against
it. And now, I want to say to you that the Knights of Labor in
their organization represented the solidarity of the
laborers&rsquo; interests. But that organization came before the
time when that concentration of capital had completely occurred
on the industrial field. As a result it was impossible to form an
organization that should represent the absolute solidarity of the
working class of the world. That was the product of industrial
evolution. The rise of the American Federation of Labor on the
ruins of the Knights of Labor was a recognition of the principle
of craft autonomy. They had gained nothing from experience of the
past. They did not combine the principle of industrial solidarity
along with their craft autonomy, and consequently that
organization is ineffective to protect the interests of the
working class, and, in the final analysis, fundamentally immoral,
as every organization of the present day must be that is not
founded on the lines of the class struggle and that does not
enable the workers to present a united phalanx against every
onslaught of the capitalist class.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that the ideas that have been presented very
ably on both sides of the field find their expression in the
report of the Committee on Constitution. I have heard the idea
expressed that the Western Federation of Miners and kindred
organizations, for instance, were to be disorganized on account
of this fact. I want you to understand this, and if you
understand industrial evolution you will grasp the fact as soon
as it stated: That with every advance in industry each line of
industry becomes more highly specialized. So the necessity of an
organization representing the mining industries of this country,
organized to protect the interests of the men who work in the
mines, will be clearer and better defined ten years from now than
it is at the present time.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: Mr. Chairman and Delegates to this
Convention: I am just slightly inclined to think that the
delegates who have spoken upon this all-important proposition
have been just a little inclined to overdraw the proposition.
Now, I feel that what I want to know is this: I want to satisfy
myself that I understand this proposition. I believe I understand
the call for this convention. I believe that we have done two of
the things that this convention has been called for. We are now
about to do another thing that the convention was called for.
This, in my opinion, is the important proposition. This
convention was called for what? Passing up the other two
propositions that have been passed upon, and taking the matter up
from this Manifesto, it clearly says: &ldquo;A movement to
fulfill these conditions must consist of a great industrial
union, embracing all the workers, providing for craft autonomy
locally, industrial autonomy internationally, and working class
unity generally.&rdquo; Is that not clear? Doesn&rsquo;t this
declaration make the proposition that is before this convention?
This proposition is clearer than any of the arguments that have
been made yet upon the proposition, to my notion. It is the duty
of this convention to clearly set forth, in my opinion, an
industrial plan of organization. Now, if we fail to do that, then
to my notion we fail to perform largely the purpose that we were
brought here to perform. Let us see how this thing will work. We
say we are going&mdash;I am in favor of the amendment because the
amendment suggests that&mdash;it says that the organization shall
be made up and organized and given jurisdiction over the
different industries of the country. Much stress has been laid
upon the fact that the Western Federation of Miners is an
industrial organization. Let us agree to that. How is the Western
Federation of Miners organized? They are organized as miners in
the mining camps; in the smelting camps they are organized as
smeltermen; in the large camps of the West they are organized as
miners, as engineers, as smelters, as ropemen and the other
classes associated in that particular industry. The miner has
absolute local trade autonomy. The smelterman has absolute local
trade autonomy. The ropeman has absolute local trade autonomy.
Now, that settles that mining industry proposition. Do you
propose to carry the proposition logically out to every other
line of industry? If you do, then there can be no dispute or
quarrel or fuss about the proposition. If you do not propose to
carry that out with the different mechanics and the different
groups of workingmen in the other industries, then I say we fail
in our purpose; and I believe that the amendment carries it out
clearly, more so than the explanation of the proposition
submitted by the Constitution Committee. We might take the baking
industry, for instance. It is a large industry. Now, there are
different kinds of bakers; some of you may think that there are
some confounded poor bakers. But there are bakers who bake bread,
and there are bakers who make pies, two distinct and separate
kinds of bakers. The pie maker would be absolutely in a piemakers
union; the bread baker would be in a bread bakers&rsquo; union;
the people who work in the factories, their shipping clerks,
their receiving clerks, their mixers and all kinds of other
tradesmen that cannot recall readily; then there is a number of
women folks; are those to be brought together and mixed up as
dough is mixed? Not at all, in my opinion. The piemakers will
have local trade autonomy; the bread bakers will have local trade
autonomy; the shipping clerks, receiving clerks and the other
bakers in the cracker factories will have their local trade
autonomy, and their organizations will be operated locally and
they will be permitted to transact and perform their local
business in their local way. But the authority granted to those
various locals will be given to them by reason of the particular
industry. That is to say, neither one of those locals can act
arbitrarily, independently and to the disadvantage of the other
locals engaged in that industry. Now, you take another large
industry, such as the manufacture of all kinds of machinery.</p>
<p>There are a number of trades, well defined trades, in that
particular industry. For instance, there is the patternmaker; he
is, a woodworker. There is the flaskmaker; he is a woodworker and
works all the time in wood. Then comes the molder, who works with
the flasks made by the flaskmaker, and works with the patterns
made by the patternmaker. And then under the same roof is the
machinist, in the same building, working for the same proprietor,
for the same employer. He handles the castings, finishes the
castings, etc. Then there is the blacksmith, then there is the
boilermaker, distinct separate trades. Now, it is not the
intention, I do not believe, of this Constitution Committee or of
the proposition submitted by them to this convention, to mix all
those trades up together. I don&rsquo;t think so, but it
don&rsquo;t clearly say so; so that the amendment is more clear,
in my opinion, and conveys the right intelligence to the workers
of the country. Now, if you are going to mix those people, it is
absolutely impossible, gentlemen; it is simply impossible to mix
them. You want to construct the organization in such matters in
accordance with the Manifesto and the sentiments therein
expressed. There are ways to give the various industries their
industrial autonomy, and then their local management, etc.,
always subject to the central authority of the general
organization. Now, we say that the trades that I have just
mentioned, in the manufacture of Machinery, are distinct trades.
Let me tell&mdash;it is unnecessary to say this&mdash;relative to
the organization of employers. The American Federation of Labor
guarantees&mdash;now, remember this&mdash;guarantees to every
international organization chartered by it or affiliated with it,
if you please&mdash;guarantees that national organization strict
trade autonomy. It does not make any provisions in the charter of
that organization about affiliation or any relation to the trade
next to it at all. In other words, each organization chartered by
the American Federation of Labor has a license to work
independently, distinctly, free from any affiliation or
association with any organization in the American Federation of
Labor. That is to say, that if the molders go on strike, the
machinists have a perfect right to remain at work. That is
international trade autonomy guaranteed by the American
Federation of Labor. They are guaranteed trade autonomy by reason
of their charter granted them by their national organization, and
those organizations commonly act separately and independently of
each other, without any regard for each other&rsquo;s interests,
sometimes catering to the employer, and by reason of one or two
of those organizations dickering with the employer at a time
means defeating the other trades engaged in that particular
industry. That is absolutely and positively wrong. We are here to
denounce that, and instead to offer this plan of industrial
unionism. Properly worked out, it will eliminate the possibility
of such a thing occurring; for the reason that the central
general body would compel every one of be obliged to support the
particular trade that was in difficulty; for the reason that the
central general body would compel every one of the organizations
or everyone of those trades to support the trade which now is on
strike, and they would all, if it came to a strike of one, would
be obliged to strike at one and the same time. Now, I believe it
was the intention of the convention to construct such an
organization, and I think it is going to do that. But I believe
that we want to express that idea, if that is the idea, just as
plainly, just as positively, just as absolutely as it is possible
for us to make it. Now, if that idea of industrial autonomy is
not given to the various and different industries, and then the
local autonomy given to the different trades within the
particular industries, I fear, Delegates, that this organization
will not take on as large proportions as the delegates here hope
to see it take on. Now, we cannot mix up, as some of us here
would have it&mdash;we cannot mix up laundry workers with hotel
girls or bakery girls or anything of that sort. I do not believe
we want to. Not that there is any particular difference in
people, or that we recognize any particular difference so far as
the people are concerned. But the trades are so specialized that
the waiter girl wants to be in her organization by herself, and
the laundry people want to be in an organization by themselves;
and so on down the line. That is the only practical way to
construct this organization, and that is the only way, in my
judgment, that we can go before the public, go before the
workingmen and women in this country and secure their support and
co-operation in this movement. There is another thing that I want
to say in this connection, so far as this matter is concerned.
Now, I have absolutely nothing to say as to the action of the
committee. I think the committee is an excellent committee, and I
think that they did excellent work, much better than what I could
have done. But the proposition that the amendment has a bearing
upon is this: How this organization should be composed. The
section says: &ldquo;This organization shall be composed of
thirteen international industrial unions designated as
follows.&rdquo; Thirteen international unions. It makes no
difference if there were fourteen industries, the organization
must be arbitrarily and unnaturally confined to thirteen
industries; a thing that with all the 120 industries is
absolutely impossible to do. You cannot confine it to two
industries; you cannot confine it to one industry; and you cannot
confine it to thirteen industries if there are fourteen
industries, because it is unnatural to do it and it is arbitrary
to do it, and the people engaged in that particular industry
simply will not recognize the authority of this convention.</p>
<p>(Here Delegate Guy Miller was called to preside in the absence
of the Chairman).</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Mr. Chairman, I would like through you to ask the
speaker a question. Doesn&rsquo;t it say &ldquo;industrial
unions&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;industries&rdquo; ?</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: It is thirteen industrial unions or groups,
yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: It says here that &ldquo;it shall be composed
of thirteen international industrial unions.&rdquo; Thirteen;
isn&rsquo;t that what I read?</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Yes, but you intimated that it was thirteen
industries it was to be organized in.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: That is what it means.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: No, sir, not to my mind.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: It says, &ldquo;There shall be thirteen
international industrial unions, designated as follows.&rdquo; Is
it organized on industrial lines? I cannot understand unless it
is thirteen industries; and if it is fourteen you will have to
put it into fourteen.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A point of information. The whole
intention of this committee is not that it means thirteen unions
according to thirteen industries, but thirteen industrial unions;
that is, unions industrially organized in thirteen departments or
divisions. I wish the speaker would not misinterpret that. It
does not mean just thirteen national or international industries,
but thirteen groups, thirteen international industrial unions,
grouped as follows, according to these divisions: division one,
two, and so on to division thirteen.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: A point of information. If it is thirteen
international industries industrially grouped, it ought to be
&ldquo;internationally grouped,&rdquo; and nationally.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: It may be possible that I cannot understand
this proposition, and I do not want to misinterpret this,
proposition, but I want to get straight on the proposition
myself, and I want this convention to get me straight if, I am
capable of being put straight. It may be possible that I am dull
of comprehension, that I cannot comprehend this thing correctly.
&ldquo;It shall be composed of thirteen international industrial
unions, designated as follows.&rdquo; It shall be composed of all
persons working in the following industries: clerks, salesmen,
tobacco workers, etc. Then it goes down to breweries, and then we
take up mining, milling and smelting. I believe that is
absolutely correct, the mining, milling and smelting; I believe
that is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: It is departments and groups of industries.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: Well, this proposition proposes the division of
industry. I do not think the word &ldquo;division&rdquo;
represents the proposition of &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; at all. I
contend that the most effective way is to organize upon
industrial lines, and then make the necessary provision for those
people engaged in the various industries of the country to afford
the different workingmen, laboring men, mechanics and artisans,
etc., an opportunity to recognize one central authority in an
industry, and then that industry to recognize the general,
central authority, of the general organization. I fear that
unless we recognize that fact, that it is going to seriously
hamper the growth and prosperity and success of this
organization. I am satisfied that it is absolutely impossible to
mix men and women of various industries and different crafts or
trades into one organization, when there is a sufficient number
to carry on a successful organization having jurisdiction over
that particular trade. But I want you to keep in mind always that
those different organizations, in my opinion, must be operated
and directed by one central authority, and that neither one of
those departments or neither one of those trades in an industry
can arbitrarily and independently act to the disadvantage of that
particular industry. But we must afford to the laboring men in
those various industries an opportunity to manage their own
affairs locally. If that is the purpose of this constitutional
report, then I say we should make it clear. Why do we suggest the
word &ldquo;division&rdquo; if it is an industrial proposition?
The proposition itself suggests division, while the proposition
or the word &ldquo;industries&rdquo; would suggest the
proposition of unity for those in a particular industry. I thank
you, officers and members, for your attention.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: I rise to a point of information. You said the
piemakers and bakers and shipping clerks in the department of
baking constituted the industry, and that it would be a separate
industry.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: Now, suppose that there is a large mining industry
with a bake shop and laundry attached. The workers in the laundry
and bakery would produce commodities for the purpose of running
the mining industry, while those in the mining industry want the
bread and pies made by the bakers, etc., at that particular
point. Now, under the industrial organization according to the
report of the Constitution Committee, would those bakers not be
organized as miners, and are they not to be organized under the
Western Federation of Miners and not according to their craft or
their trade as bakers?</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: No, they would be organized as bakers,
certainly.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: But is it not a fact that they&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I shall have to decide that it is out of order
to make a speech in asking a question for information.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: Do you know to-day whether or not in the Western
Federation of Miners they are organized as bakers or as
miners?</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: The president of the Western Federation of
Miners is a delegate to this convention, and he is more capable
of answering that to the entire satisfaction of yourself and to
the satisfaction of the convention than I am.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: A point of information. If it is in order I would
move that those on one side of this question select one member to
debate with Delegate Coates, and let those two decide this, and
limit the debate down to a point.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair would decide that this is not a
controversy between one side and the other, but merely a
discussion to bring out the underlying points in industrial
unionism. I therefore decide such a motion to be out of
order.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: A question of personal privilege. I would like
if possible to try to impress upon the minds of the delegates
here present that there is really no fundamental difference
between either side of this argument.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Well, I do not believe that that is a question
of personal privilege, brother.</p>
<p>DEL. JAMES SMITH: Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a few
remarks; I will be very brief. Mr. President and Fellow Delegates
to this convention, I would like to know the full interpretation
of the remarks put forth here in the convention. I do believe
that this Committee on Constitution is made up of fair, honest
and upright men; I believe that they are able men, from what I
have heard since I have been in this convention; but I do
believe, Mr. Chairman and Delegates, that they are not
infallible. There are none of us infallible; we all make
mistakes; we are all liable to error. But I do say that I want to
go back from here with a full and distinct interpretation of the
constitution as it is laid down to us. I do not believe in going
back with a skeleton report, saying we can amend it after we find
out its weakness. Why not amend it now. Why not go back to our
people and say, &ldquo;Here we have got a document that we can
work out judiciously and honestly.&rdquo; How can we install
organizations in our various jurisdictions without we have a
constitution to go by? Mr. President and Brothers, all the
arguments I have heard, to my mind have endorsed ably and nobly
the amendment; Brother De Leon, Brother Sherman, and Brother
&mdash;who was the other brother?&mdash;there were three brothers
who quoted from this section of the Manifesto&mdash;spoke of the
intention for which we came here. I represent the Stationary
Engineers and Firemen of the city of New York. I believe all the
big cities throughout this country have got the same grievances
to put forth that we have. I represent a local of engineers who
have come out for the industrial movement, who have been
discharged from their positions because they advocated it,
because they had a contract drawn up for eight hours for a
day&rsquo;s work, and the so-called trade autonomists came along
and substituted a contract drawn up for the bosses. Mr.
President, I want to bear my testimony on the position of
Delegate Trautmann, who has got both contracts. I represent the
local of engineers and firemen who have been threatened in an
issue of the so-called journal of the International Engineers in
either November or December, with assassination. Why? Because we
have advocated the industrial movement. Nobody knows that better
than Delegate De Leon. Mr. President, suppose I go back to my
local; according to this report of the committee, I go back to
New York, and I say to our local engineers&mdash;well, I am ahead
of time. Mr. President and Delegates, we have in New York about
fourteen to sixteen thousand engineers and firemen. We have
perhaps three to four thousand of those organized, the majority
in the Federation. Then suppose we have to call out all the
engineers of the various departments; we have no local of
engineers; there is no local left for us to join. I would like to
ask the committee if that is the sense of the recommendation that
they have brought in in that part of the constitution? Can you
answer that Brother Hagerty?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I think Brother Hall here on the floor will bear
me out in the illustration that I am going to take time to use,
which will answer that, and which I think is the sentiment of the
committee. For instance, we will suppose that we have a building
industry and there are three or four engineers working on the
construction of a building, and there are carpenters and plumbers
and tinners. Now, if any difficulty arises which affects all the
engineers as engineers, then your engineers&rsquo; committee
within the building industry handles that as relating to your
fuss. Then if you cannot settle that grievance, it comes before
the combined board of all the workers represented in that
department.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: The local?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: The local, to be decided by them. Then if it
cannot be decided by them, it is carried to the general
administration; and in that way you have local autonomy, but not
in the A. F. of L. sense.</p>
<p>Del. Smith: No, we have had enough of that. The A. F. of L.
says explicitly that &ldquo;You in Brooklyn must stay in
Brooklyn. You cannot come over the bridge. You in Manhattan must
stay in Manhattan; you can come up to the bridge.&rdquo; Those
were the words of the A. F. of L. But I want to know from Brother
Hagerty, when it states thirteen groups, if it puts us in with
the gripmen or what branch of industry; because I hold that we
have a right to have this by virtue of the Manifesto, that we
have a right to hold our own meetings; we have in the engineers
our employment bureau; we have our educational bureaus; the
electrical workers have the same; the members of other unions
have the same.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Just a moment; perhaps I can clear up what you
want. In addition to what I said, each division has its own
management and makes its own constitution, subject to the general
principles of this Manifesto. There is nothing in it that forbids
the engineers in the city of New York, for their special benefit,
getting together in any local meeting, but at the same time they
are also members of whatever industry they are working in. Now,
that is impossible with the A. F. of L., but it is possible with
this, because they all belong to the same thing, to the
Industrial Workers.</p>
<p>Del. Smith: If we have all the engineers working in the
brewing industry for instance, or in the printing industry, we
are held subject to recognize the grievance of any organization
in this body, but will they have to become members of their
various industries?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: They are members of their various
industries.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: But do we have to recognize them in our local?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Not necessarily.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: I want to have this explained plainly, so that we
may know where we are at when we go to make our report. The
report of the committee as to that part of the constitution I am
not satisfied with at the present time, but I believe the
amendment will clear up that part of it better. I am not entirely
satisfied with that part because it doesn&rsquo;t show
clearly.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I am afraid it would be a good idea for the
speaker to repair to some ante-room with a member of the
Constitution Committee and clear up the doubts in his mind.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: These questions that he is bringing up now are
settled later on in the constitution. They cannot he all covered
here in one section. but the constitution as a whole must be
dealt with.</p>
<p>DEL. BEUCHERT: The amendment, to my conception, means that the
national and international organizations in existence now in this
country might be able to join this organization, and here is, I
guess, the point where we might stumble over the report of our
Constitutional Committee. We must consider the fact that there
are many of the members of the trades organized in this country
in the national and international organizations, and they are
organized for the purpose of bettering their condition, their
existence. They may not be organized on the principle of this
organization, but the rank and file are for the betterment of
their conditions in social life, and they have made many
sacrifices to build up their organizations. What is the intention
of this organization to do with these organizations in existence?
Will they pass over them as if they were not in existence, or
will they recognize them? Will they give them an opportunity to
affiliate with this organization or not? If you take the
standpoint that these organizations are no good and you
don&rsquo;t want them, then they have to break up if they want to
join us, and is there anybody here who believes they will do that
right away? Do you forget about this fight and this trouble that
we had to overcome to bring all these people into our
organization? I think not. I guess we have plenty to show, just
as these organizations are put up and just as the people of these
organizations have put it before us. They might join our
organization as a body, and by the simple reason that they want
to join us then they will recognize our principle of
organization. I guess they will do it right away, and they will
do it by whole organizations. If they don&rsquo;t join us, they
might have their fight between themselves, and the separate
locals might join all right enough, but the situation with the
national organization is such that it might be convinced that it
better start in the trade union movement to join this industrial
movement and shake hands with all the brothers of the world. Now,
there is another point that we want to take time on, for it is
just on the point which was made by the delegates in their
speeches, about centralization and the power this thing had:
After the report of this constitution I saw right away from this
that the most power of this organization is in the hands of the
President. The most power is centralized in one hand, and under
certain conditions he might be disposed to use all of his power.
I don&rsquo;t believe in that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The part that you are discussing now belongs
later in the constitution. Please confine yourself to the
question under discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. BEUCHERT: Well, all the others have spoken on the same
line, and I claim the same right as any other.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I beg your pardon. It is not the desire of the
chair to be arbitrary, but simply to confine the discussion along
the line that is before the house.</p>
<p>Del. Beuchert: I want to speak just on the general subject of
the organization, and I want to make a few remarks.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That comes up later.</p>
<p>DEL. BEUCHERT: No, there is no more chance for it to come up.
It is just the general subject of the organization, that is
essential in this centralized power.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair wishes to say that the power vested in
the Executive Board and the various officers will be discussed in
the report of the Constitution Committee, later on, therefore any
discussion on that line is out of order at the present time.</p>
<p>DEL. BEUCHERT: Very well; what I want to know is whether the
organizations that are already in existence are ready to join
this organization or not.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: I would like to ask the Secretary of the
Constitution Committee to read that portion or clause providing
for those industrial groups or departments or international
industrial unions as they are grouped here.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Here is the section that provides for
that, and it might possibly stop the discussion. It is section
three: &ldquo;The financial and industrial affairs of each
international industrial department shall be conducted by an
executive board of not less than seven nor more than twenty-one,
selected and elected by the general membership of said
international industrial department; provided, that the executive
board and general membership of said international industrial
department shall at all times be subordinate to the General
Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the World; subject
to appeal, provided the expense of such referendum shall be borne
by the international industrial department or international
industrial union or unions involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Del, French: Now, Brother Chairman and Delegates-</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I move you that we take a vote now.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: Just these figures is the only question I want to
ask about, to get at those figures, to have it made plain that
those thirteen groupings provide for conducting the business by
an executive board of not less than seven nor more than
twenty-one members, selected and elected by the general
membership of said international industrial department. That is
what I wanted to get at, because I think it is time that we got
this discussion back to bedrock, back where we started. We have
gone all over the map in the discussion, we have viewed it from
all sides, but that does not matter. My only idea in getting up
here was to try to clear away any fog that might have gathered as
a result of the broad, if I may term it so, discussion that has
taken place since this thing was first brought up. Now, the word
&ldquo;fetich&rdquo; was applied to the report of the committee.
I do not believe there is an intelligent, discerning delegate
here, man or woman, who believes that anybody who has spoken in
favor of the report of the Constitution Committee looks upon it
as a fetich at all; I do not believe it. And I do not believe
that anybody&mdash;any discerning person who had listened to this
discussion&mdash;can be affected by any insinuations as to the
plan here emanating from the brains of a few men, or who will
imagine that economic conditions will compel or cause the
automatic bringing up of a correct organization without the
brains of men being used in forming it. But I want to get back to
this, and we need not bother about those things at all. This plan
under discussion that the Constitution Committee brings in
recommends this section providing for thirteen groups,
international unions, with executive boards containing not less
than seven nor more than twenty-one representatives; and I
believe it provides further on, doesn&rsquo;t it, in another
section, that the president shall be a member of that board?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: Well, you see this is a skeleton of the new
organization intended to be formed, and you bring this in. Now,
the amendment proposed by Delegate Coates, as I understand it, is
to abolish that arbitrary grouping, as it has been termed, those
thirteen arbitrary divisions, and to insert the words,
&ldquo;international industrial unions.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that
right?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: Now, the question then of the practicability or
impracticability of either plan is a thing that goes right
through this discussion. To my mind, and I think to all those who
have watched most closely and who have tried to get on their feet
as to the position that we should take in relation to this, is
that this proposition is as nearly practicable as can at the
present time and under present conditions be devised. Now, we
have come here to launch an organization that will stand upon
correct principles, the principles laid down in the Manifesto. We
come here to launch an organization that will be formed on those
lines as nearly as we can possibly make it. We do not come here
proposing to cater to the forms already in existence. We do not
come proposing to figure on whether we shall as the delegate over
there referred to&mdash;figure as to what we shall do to placate
those international craft unions in the A. F. of L. We do not
come here to express a fear lest the lines laid down do not fit
the lines already laid down by the A. F. of L. and would not
enable them to jump bodily as a craft union into this
organization and retain that craft autonomy that enables them to
keep the workers divided. We did not come here to worry if some
one should be annoyed by our attitude. We came here to try and
set the workingman on his feet. We came here to try to establish
an organization that represents as near as possible the correct
lines that should be retained for an economic organization to
fit, as has been previously expressed, the economic conditions
that face us. Surely any discerning person can see that the
nearest thing outside of the ideal that was laid down by Brother
Hall yesterday, the nearest thing that at present we can get, is
this proposition of the Constitution Committee. And now my view
is this. Delegate Coates&rsquo;s amendment provides for national
industrial unions. It does not define what an industry is. He
does not want to be arbitrary, I presume. But what will that lead
to? Don&rsquo;t you see the difference between the attempt at
system that has been made by the Constitution Committee, in the
attempt to get as much system as possible into the launching of
this organization, so that it can be carried out in a manner that
will remove or avoid as much as possible of the friction that
will come about&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see the difference between
that and the condition that would result from the adoption of the
course as proposed by that amendment? It does not define what an
industry is, and leaves it open to all these organizations which
call themselves industrial organizations, that only compose a
small part of an industry, if an industry could be definitely
defined? As I understand it, the Constitution Committee, in
devising this figure, did it under the present economic
conditions, while if possible we should have all the workers,
because the interdependence of all industry under modern means of
production is taking that into consideration, and that they
should devise some plan that will at least lend system to the
creating and building up of the new organization; that they could
to-day, in figuring out the economic groupings of the working
class, draw temporarily (I understand that to be the sense of the
committee, temporarily) thirteen economic groupings or industrial
groupings; not thirteen industries, as has previously been
explained, but thirteen economic groupings in which to place the
different sets of industries in each one of those groupings, and
to launch the organization in this manner, bearing in mind all
the time the coming of a convention that will improve upon that
skeleton and make it still more centralized. I for one, if nobody
else, will on this floor before this convention adjourns make a
motion that this constitution when adopted shall stand till the
next convention, so that it will not become, as I heard a
remark&mdash;I think it was Brother Hagerty that made it&mdash;a
crystal that we will have to smash; but that it will stand as a
skeleton structure of the new organization, that can be taken
apart and rebuilt on a more improved plan, more consistent with
the economic conditions facing us at the next convention. Now,
that is why I arose, to try to get this down back to first
principles, to the plane of the practicability of an organization
which does not draw any hard and fast lines, which leaves it open
to interminable discussion, when a local is organized, as to
which industrial grouping it should be placed in. As for the
practicability of this, it seems to me that there is possibly a
misunderstanding in the meaning of some. I have noticed that
Brother Smith was in doubt and did not seem to be quite clear on
the conditions that we will confront. Now, this Manifesto
declares here&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. JAMES SMITH: Do you mean to insinuate that I did not make
myself clear?</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: I am not arguing the question. I only made the
remark.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: I want to be understood on the point, if I was not
clear. I still hold that I was clear on that point. I still hold
for the interests of the local, and I still insist on standing by
this Manifesto as adopted.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This brother has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: What I wanted to say was this. There is a
possibility, and I drew that conclusion from the remarks of
Brother Smith, of some persons misunderstanding the position that
we would be in because of this grouping as laid down by this
Constitution Committee&rsquo;s paragraph here. Now, I do not see
any difficulty in carrying out the plan of organization laid down
in those groupings. This Manifesto provides there in that clause
that has been referred to by many others, &ldquo;A movement to
fulfill these conditions must consist of one great industrial
union, embracing all industries, providing for craft autonomy
locally, industrial autonomy internationally, and working class
unity generally.&rdquo; The conditions are referred to in the
previous part of the Manifesto, which describes the modern
capitalist conditions where industries are controlled and
centralized in management, and interdependent, and necessitate a
working class organization to meet them. But it provides for
craft autonomy locally and industrial autonomy internationally.
Now, what I wanted to know was this. There was nothing said about
representation of the various crafts on the various divisions,
about the difficulty of having them represented on the executive
board of the administrative bodies, and it seemed to me it was a
plea for the present A. F. of L. international and national craft
unions, and that such bodies as applied to join would want their
particular craft or division of the industry represented on the
administrative bodies. Well, now, I claim that this plan provides
as nearly as possible for all that; as nearly as needed. The
executive board of one of those departments is to be composed of
seven to twenty-one. Now, take for instance the railroad
industry. We can have an executive board in that grouping. On
that executive board there will be say twenty-one members. Now, I
think twenty-one divisions in one of these industries,
represented each by a member of that division on the
administration board of that department, will come pretty near
covering all important crafts in that department. And they will
all be represented on that executive board or advisory board or
whatever it may be termed, the administrative board of that
particular department, and they elect a president who becomes as
I understand the purport of the fifth section, ipso facto a
member of the General Executive Board. Isn&rsquo;t that the
understanding?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: Now, this department elects by referendum a
president who is in touch with an executive or advisory board
composed of representatives of the various divisions of the
crafts, if you may call them crafts, of the department. Being in
that position, and being the choice by referendum of the
department, he is surely able to represent on the national board
his department and the divisions of his department, and you
hereby get a national board with thirteen members, and that is
about as large as is workable to launch an organization. On the
other hand, the amendment as proposed would cut down that
arbitrary division, and abolish the system, and at the same time
be anarchistic, if you will. If you would draw a hard and fast
line, some particular craft or division will kick about it, and
what do you get by kicking? You have no definite standard of what
an industry can be. You have got to go along guessing at it all
the time and arguing it out and trying to build up this industry
and that industry, and you can have, as has been stated, anywhere
from, 60 to 127 or more various trades claiming to be an
industry, which would, according to that constitution if it were
adopted, claim representation on the General Executive Board.
Otherwise you have a confusion that will be created by the
absence of any definition as to what will constitute a division
of the workers into any kind of group. Now, I have not talked
with the committee about it, but I believe that one of their
ideas in putting that together is that they desired some system
to start with; they desired to have some ground to stand upon,
and they offer that in the belief that they could not get
anything better at the present time. I do not believe&mdash;I
hope that such is not the case&mdash;I do not believe that there
is any number of men in this hall who want a bad start; yet an
outsider who did not know about it and was sitting up in the
gallery and watching the debate of to-day and yesterday, would
imagine that some of us were trying to do as you will find done
in the various legislative bodies of the various countries when
something is on hand that needs to obstructed; the
obstructionists talk it to death; they keep it going on and on
till the hulk of those present are tired of it and want to get
rid of the whole business. At present I do not believe that there
is anybody or any group of persons in this convention as it now
stands that would want to do any such thing. I would rather
believe that the actions, or rather the attitude struck by the
opposers of this proposition of the Constitution Committee, show
that they are honestly striving to have a plan adopted which they
believe, as far as their understanding of the proposition
goes&mdash;which they believe to be the correct thing to do. But
this debate or discussion has gone on now a long time, and we
have heard it touched upon from all sides, and surely any
discerning person in this convention watching the speakers,
sizing up their arguments, trying to size them up for himself,
and keeping or trying to keep in mind just what this stands for
and just what the amendment stands for, and not allowing himself
to be diverted by any expressions on the matter, must surely now
have reached a conclusion as to the practicability and
feasibility and wisdom and correctness of this plan or of the
other. And I hope that those present will not indulge in any more
lengthy speeches (laughter), but that when any person in the
future has something to say in corroboration of what somebody
else said, that he will do what I did yesterday when Delegate
Hall spoke so cleverly for the constitution&mdash;stand up and
say he endorses what the previous comrade said, and in that way
we will avoid having this proposition talked to death, and more
confusion brought about by somebody rushing in with a substitute
in order to get another lengthy discussion.</p>
<p>Del. W. F. Morrison: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: I have
not imposed upon your attention a very great deal since I have
been in this convention, but I hope to be able in the few remarks
that I may make and the few questions that I may ask, to find out
just where I am at; not where the convention is at, but where I
am at on this proposition. Having received an invitation to visit
Chicago, having been invited by the general invitation in this
Manifesto, and realizing from a life of experience in the labor
movement that there must be something done, and that that thing
must be something definitely done for the whole working people, I
came to this convention; realizing fully that if the workingman
shall ever be emancipated it must be done through the wisdom that
lies in the working class. Do we exhibit wisdom in our
convention? Will the world at large look upon us as being a wise,
deliberative body, when we cannot determine just exactly what we
want upon the second proposition presented to us? I have before
me a skeleton which was prepared for this committee for the
purpose of constituting this conference into a working machine.
The brotherhood or organization with which I am immediately
affiliated gave instruction to unite our body with this,
providing it held to the lines of the Manifesto. Now, are we
holding to the lines of the Manifesto on this question? What
impresses me very strongly in the arguments on both sides is the
indecisiveness of the opinions of the delegates on this floor,
and it reminds me of the old religious muddle, that &ldquo;You
shall and you shan&rsquo;t, can and you can&rsquo;t, you will be
damned if you do and you will be damned if you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; That is the way the thing stands to-day, you
shall and you shan&rsquo;t. Brother Coates on the one hand says
this represents one proposition, and Brother Hagerty on the other
hand says it represents another proposition. They are all aiming
to wipe out these lines of demarcation, and that is what this
Manifesto stands for. I see here groupings and there groupings,
and they amount to thirteen. Now, let us see whether the
Manifesto includes any grouping to speak of except as a universal
brotherhood of workingmen. One says, &ldquo;Let us change the
number of these divisions.&rdquo; The Manifesto says, &ldquo;A
movement to fulfill these conditions&rdquo;&mdash;now I am going
to read into it a word when I come to it, embodying the class
struggle; let us simply inject the proposition&mdash;&ldquo;must
be founded on the class struggle,&rdquo; and its general
administration must be conducted in harmony with a recognition of
the class struggle, and it must be international. And now, coming
back to the first proposition: &ldquo;A movement to fulfill these
conditions must consist of one great industrial union&rdquo;; one
great industrial union, which our name implies, and which I
support and cherish with all my heart. Now, let us go on:
&ldquo;A great industrial union embracing all industries,
providing for craft autonomy.&rdquo; Now, that comes right back
to the unity with which this industrial union must be composed.
It says, &ldquo;Granting to each and every local craft its craft
autonomy locally.&rdquo; Now, &ldquo;Industrial autonomy
internationally and nationally&rdquo;; &ldquo;embracing all
industries, providing for craft autonomy locally, industrial
autonomy internationally.&rdquo; Now, then, I would presume, from
what Brother Hagerty said a while ago, that these groups here
represent international, industrial conditions; that the
industrial grouping would stand for industrial unions, or the
union of industries. I understand that each and every craft or
trade shall have its local union, and then whatever industry or
craft may be found employed in it will organize themselves into a
national union of their craft along the industrial lines with
other crafts in the same industry, but not in the same group with
another craft. That brings us up directly to the centralized
government which is represented in the Industrial Workers of the
World. The plan as laid down by the committee proposes that they
shall arbitrarily say what is individual craft autonomy or what
craft individuals shall belong to in a group or division. I am in
favor of the amendment. I wish we could be now advanced far
enough along that we could wipe out all of these dividing lines,
whether they be imaginary or otherwise, and come directly to the
individual uniting with the great industrial movement of the
workers of the world, in deed and in truth. It was said upon this
floor that the Knights of Labor was before its time. My friends,
it was not before it was needed, however. The Knights of Labor
may have come before the majority of the workingmen were able to
handle the situation, and when we came back to divide ourselves
up into groups and separate ourselves by these class lines, we
see that most of the working people are not yet ready to be
organized into an industrial organization that comprises the
whole entire working class of the world. Let us tear down, let us
wipe out these lines of demarcation, and plant ourselves unitedly
upon the proposition of a united brotherhood of the workers of
the world.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I wish to ask the speaker a question. Do I
understand that the speaker believes that the proposed amendment
would not divide the working class into different trades and
crafts?</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: No, it would not. It would divide them locally.
Will you ask that question again, please?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I wanted to ask whether you believe that this
proposed amendment that you speak in favor of&mdash;you say that
this grouping divides the working class into thirteen different
groups. Now, I want to know, wouldn&rsquo;t the amendment to this
proposition divide the working class into groups, indefinitely?
The only difference I can see is that these groups are definitely
stated, and the other groups are indefinitely stated.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: It will divide up all the trades, and their own
locals will take care of such things as relate to each trade
specifically, and those trades shall form internationally into an
industrial union embracing all workers in that line. For
instance, I am working now in the oil fields. We have a
transportation department pertaining to the oil field, yet there
is no one working in that field except workers directly employed
in the production of oil or identified with transporting the oil,
etc. We have derrick men, teamsters, roustabouts, watchmen, pipe
men, etc. Then we have the refiner, the blacksmith, the
machinist, the tank maker, and all of them work in and around the
specialized oil industry from beginning to end. Now, then, if you
group the oil men as an industry with some other industry or
industries, the direct interests of the men in the oil industry
may be under the control of men not in that industry but grouped
with them, and they will give the preference to their own
industries in this group. But supposing we have groups making up
the distinct industries, including nothing but men who work
directly in the oil industry, for instance, their interests will
be better understood and protected than in any other way. That is
my contention. I hope you understand that. Is that satisfactory
to you? Now, my friends, I recognize that this is a complex
question. I recognize that it is necessary that this convention
should construct a constitution which should be perfectly clear
to the workingman in the ditch, so the organizer will have no
trouble to make him understand his relation to the entire
proposition. But when we who are interested and have studied to
some extent our relation with the laboring world, cannot agree
upon the interpretation of this chart submitted as a part of the
constitution and in explanation of it, how do you expect the
organizer who goes into the field to make it plain to a man who
digs in the ditch? I believe in the Western Federation of Miners
or any other organization of that kind, with the knowledge that
rests in the individual members of the miners, the organizer
could go and explain to them, but with the great mass of men that
are found in many organizations they would not understand it.
Therefore this constitution must be made plain and simple, with
no technical words. Now, let me make another illustration to show
you that this plan of grouping is inconsistent even with the line
of nature. The whole human anatomy is based upon the cell
proposition; life in all forms is based upon the cell. I
understand that the individual unit member is a cell in this
organization. Those cells are made up into bones and tissues, and
they are different in proportion to the tissues that they make
up, such as muscle, brain, bone, dermis and all those things.
Now, then, you cannot expect to find the cell of a muscle in the
brain; therefore you cannot group them together. We find that all
of the cells that belong to the brain and form the brain are
right in the brain. Now, we have the blacksmith; the blacksmith
has interests in common with every other blacksmith, no matter
where you find him. Now, to group him for the benefit of his
class, he should be placed in relation to his interests as a
blacksmith. Now, we have another class, another relation, with
reference to skill. We have the relation of the unskilled, and
the blacksmith, boiler makers, machinist, pattern-makers,
molders, and all those trades that make up a certain industry.
Now, in the industrial plan that industry will have an
organization, without any other connection except directly upon
the center of this chart, which is the administrative department
of this organization. It must not come through some other
channel, say the miners, unless he is grouped by his organization
intimately with the miners&rsquo; organization. We take a miner
now and put him at the head of this group. Do you believe the
miner can represent all these other groups? No it would be just
as foolish, as I understand it, as to put the Western Federation
of Miners in charge of this central group here, and say,
&ldquo;Administer the whole entire affairs of this
organization,&rdquo; as it is to say that any miner&rsquo;s union
can name a number of individuals and group them together and
absolutely represent the industrial interests of a specific
industry, and I believe Comrade Coates will bear me out in that.
I do not believe that we are going away from this convention
without having an understanding. There seems to be a fear on the
part of some of the delegates, however, that if we change this
one particular clause we tear down the whole entire constitution
and all the work of this committee shall have been in vain. I
presume that them is wisdom enough in this vast assembly to take
that constitution and amend paragraph after paragraph and section
after section to conform to the amended condition of this one
particular paragraph.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman, does the five-minute rule apply?</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: If it had I would have sat down before now, for
I think I have talked all of five minutes. I have no personal
feeling in this matter, and I hope that none of the delegates
that will talk on this proposition will have any personal feeling
on the matter. And I can say that I have interrupted none while
they were on the floor, and I have been intensely interested in
this proposition because, friends, I am one of those individual
delegates that pay their own way; I cut $5 a day from my own
earnings, out of my employment, and $10 a day for the two Sundays
that I am apt to be here in the discussion of all these
questions. I have wanted to save time, and for that reason I have
been perfectly quiet. I hoped to be able to have this proposition
settled by this convention without my having any say-so whatever,
but since it became a general discussion I felt that I might add
my little mite, though it might be tiresome to some of the
delegates. This is my first time and it will be my last. If we
grant that which this document prescribes, local autonomy to the
individual crafts, then it follows that we must organize for our
safety the craft into its immediate industrial organization,
which shall be immediately responsible to the central body, to
the central organization, in order that we can have the returning
influence of authority pledged to the general membership in case
of necessity. Now, then, that being the case, the industry should
have a perfect local, and not a complex local and central
organization as here represented. I would be glad if we could
wipe out all these artificial lines, for I have no use for them,
because each and everyone of the industries has been given in the
outline here; the industries have all been stated, and why do we
want to aggregate them into groups and establish an arbitrary
ruling over groups which are not entirely in harmony with each
other? They can only be in harmony with conditions affecting them
in their ordinary affairs, and do not agree with them otherwise.
Then let us leave these lines out. Let us have our representation
industrially directly, without any grouping save in the general
group, the whole entire group. Then I could go to the least man
in the community, in the oil industry, and tell him, &ldquo;Here,
you can give all of the toilers a local
organization&rdquo;&mdash;call them common
laborers&mdash;&ldquo;you can have your own local, your own
grouping,&rdquo; and then when we have gotten them all into
locals to study these conditions under a charter from the main
organization, when they come in in this place and in that place
in the oil industry, they elect from themselves the necessary
officers and they can actually administer the affairs of the oil
industry without reference to the administration of the
department of mining. But when we go with a complex idea to the
workingman he will not be able to understand the necessity for
such things as that, and therefore he will not embrace the
opportunity of becoming a member. But when we tell him he can
come into his local and discuss in his local everything that
relates to his particular interests, and then that his local
shall have industrial representation directly in the convention
and connected with the central organization, he can then be made
to understand it, I believe. I thank you very kindly.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Mr. Chairman, as this is getting down to a
question of endurance, and possibly to give the stenographer work
this afternoon, I propose that we cut the debate short. It is
getting monotonous to a majority of the delegates, sitting here
and hearing the same ground being covered by every speaker
practically in the same channel, simply to be recorded by the
stenographer. (Applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is not within the power of the chair to cut
this debate short before the people of this convention want to do
so. Every other man who gets this floor is entitled to the same
courtesy, and I hope that hereafter no one will so far forget the
duty they owe to the delegate, the chair and themselves as to
needlessly interrupt the speakers; and also that the speakers
will be short and quit when they get through. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Del. Bradley: I am not going to tire you now, but I just want
to say a word or two. I don&rsquo;t believe in this
long-drawn-out talk. The Constitution Committee has made thirteen
sub-divisions of the workers. The committee recognizes as well as
any of us that the interests of the working class are all the
same. Now, to-day under capitalism we can divide the working
class into three divisions, one the food department, another the
shelter department, and the other the clothing department. We
could make three groupings if we wanted to do it that way. And
whenever a strike is initiated by any portion of the working
class which is connected with the production and distribution of
food supplies, then that would mean that this particular portion
of the working class could be backed up by all the rest of the
workers that have anything to do with the production and
distribution of foodstuffs. Then, taking the clothing department,
the same rule would apply; and so in the building department. And
finally we would come to the conclusion that these three groups
are mutually dependent upon each other, and that when any
question arises it must come right down to a class struggle of
the working class against the capitalist class. But for a matter
of convenience the Constitution Committee has divided them up
into thirteen divisions, just for convenience of dealing with
certain elements of the working class that may be instantly
involved in a strike, and also for the purpose of communicating
with them. And I think that most of the arguments that have been
advanced here overlook the point that the Constitution Committee
is trying to impress upon your minds; that these groupings are
made only for the convenience of communication with the working
class. That is all I have to say.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I assure you
that I will not take up any more than five minutes of your time.
We came here. for the purpose of doing what? We came here for the
purpose of organizing an industrial organization. It seems to me
that there is one thing above every other that has caused us to
come here, and that is the so-called scabbery that has resulted
in the jurisdiction quarrels within the American Federation of
Labor. We have before us the proposed systematic plan of the
Constitution Committee that has labored faithfully for two days
in bringing that about, and the proposed amendment. The proposed
amendment is that this industrial organization of the world shall
be composed of national and international unions embracing all
the workers of an industry. There is something indefinite,
something that is to be fought out. You will have the same
scabbing as you had in the American Federation of Labor. There is
nothing definite about that. This committee has tried to give you
a feasible, tangible, definite plan, remember that. Whatever may
be said about industrial unionism, we must first of all endeavor
to make that industrial unionism effective, and this your
committee has attempted by making a system, by proposing to you a
system upon which this industrial union must be organized. I am
not going into details, but want to refer to what the last
speaker, but one said. He shows to you the different trades
included in the oil industry, the blacksmiths and numerous other
trades. He said, &ldquo;Who is to determine who belongs to that
industry and who not?&rdquo; In order to avoid these so-called
jurisdiction squabbles we have to do the best we can and find the
best system. Now, if you endorse this amendment you endorse
anarchy, if you please. You endorse the same principle upon which
the American Federation of Labor has been organized. If you
endorse that plan you will have no system and be like the A. F.
of L. And you will find out that you will succeed much more
rapidly and much more thoroughly than working without a system. I
think that has been the experience of the human race.</p>
<p>DEL. SAINER: I have heard a great many speeches about the
jurisdictional problems of the different unions. I do not think
we came here with the idea of settling any of those problems. We
came here to settle the one great problem of securing the
organization of all the workers, and the question of what the
different unions would do is not the question at issue at all.
The fact that we depend on capital for an existence, that is the
problem to be settled.</p>
<p>(Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I admire the disposition, Mr. Chairman and
Delegation of this Convention, to listen to fourteen nearly
consecutive hours of debate upon whether or not we shall adopt
this substitute amendment offered by one of the brother delegates
upon the floor in place of the recommendation of the Constitution
Committee. I want to say to you this, in plain and explicit
terms: I do not approve of the recommendation of the committee,
from the simple fact that it is my understanding, and I think it
has developed nearly every delegate with the exception of a few
who have spoken, that the object of this convention was to find
some solution for the purpose of solidifying the workers, not
only of our country, but of the world. And when that is so, I
want to ask you, if that is solidarity? Is it? And for that
reason I say upon this floor I am not in favor of it. And while I
admire the statements of some of the delegates, and while some of
you had the pleasant opportunity to sail on spread-eagle wings of
oratory, did you not notice yesterday that one of that committee
emphatically informed you and me that whatever we might do in
regard to accepting or rejecting what that Constitution Committee
offered, they would call the roll and carry it over all
opposition? And for that reason I have kept my mouth shut, and I
think it would have been wise if a great many more of you had
done the same thing. Now, there are a few more moments left, and
delegates have the opportunity of closing this debate, and I
believe&mdash;and I arose for that express purpose more than
anything else&mdash;to say that it is due to the patience of the
delegates of this convention and to that of our honored Chairman,
that we as delegates refuse to speak longer or take the time, and
let Delegate Coates make his speech and then let us do our voting
and see whether we take the substitute or whether we take that
which is offered by the Constitution Committee. I thank you.</p>
<p>Question called for, and calls for Delegate Coates.</p>
<p>DEL. BOSKY: You have heard a whole lot of stories about this
new industrial organization, and you have heard absolutely
nothing on the economic principles involved in this question. You
have heard of the troubles of the boiler maker and the troubles
of the oil field workers and all of these, and we have heard
nothing about the wage system. Are we here protesting against the
distribution of wealth in this country? There are two things that
are closely connected with economics&mdash;production and
distribution. These two things are absolutely dependent on each
other. If you want to create harmony between these two things,
you have to make here on this floor a declaration that all things
necessary to our life which are produced and distributed in these
great industries are equally of necessity, and consequently equal
of volume. If you want to found here a new organization on the
industrial field, you must not only have wills to go about it,
you must have a principle and go out and tell every man that is
connected with this production and distribution that his share
and his part of the work is the same and equal with any other. If
you want to build a house it is just as necessary to dig the
foundation as to raise the house, and it must be done before you
can have the painting and music and education that are going to
be furnished in that house. You have to establish here and
declare here for the economic equality that is necessary to our
living, and not before will we carry out the purpose for which
this convention is here.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegates from this time on will be required to
confine themselves absolutely to the question before the
convention; that is that &ldquo;It shall be composed of national
and international unions embracing all workers of an industry.
&rdquo; That is an amendment to Section 2 of Article 1.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I desire to speak to the amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I desire you to re-read that amendment. I did
not understand it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Section 2 provides that there shall be thirteen
international industrial unions. The amendment is that it
&ldquo;shall be composed of national and international unions
embracing all workers of an industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: Mr. Chairman and Delegates, I am opposed to the
amendment for the reason that the call of this convention had in
view a different object from what the amendment proposes to make
it. I came here as one of the attendants of this convention for
the purpose of founding an organization along class lines, and
not craft lines. (Applause). I wish to lend my co-operation to
your efforts with that motive in view, and none else. The
amendment as it stands now virtually places this organization in
the same category as the A. F. of L. and other craft
organizations. (Applause). You speak about organizing them
industrially according to the amendment. You have that form of
organization to-day. I belong to the craft of printers.
Haven&rsquo;t you got your Allied Printing Trades Council? What
does that represent? The printing trade, with the type founder,
electrotyper, stereotyper, bookbinder, pressman and compositor.
Is it fulfilling its mission? I say no. Therefore, delegates, I
hope that you will not place this organization on craft lines,
but on class lines, and organize an economic union and not an
aristocratic organization. (Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I won&rsquo;t take up much time, but I want
to say something on the subject. I heard Brother O&rsquo;Neil
remark something about the construction of this being wrong. I
want to instruct him as to the numerical construction of it. The
national executive board of this body, in place of being composed
of fifteen members will be composed of thirteen members elected
by their different groups as outlined on that chart, and as the
balance of the constitution will bear me out when it is read to
you. The construction of those thirteen groups will be composed
of 273 men, if they carry out the intent of the constitution as
far as they want to go. Now, I want to say that I am opposed both
to the amendment and to the original motion, and I am going to
vote against both of them when the time comes. I endeavored
yesterday to lay before you a plan that 18,000 men asked me to do
two years ago, for the workers of this country, in the State of
Montana, and I am going back to my constituents and report to
them as I find things here, and not as I don&rsquo;t find them.
We want one single organization. We don&rsquo;t want any craft
lines. We want industrial lines. We want one central body,
centralized in some part of this country, with an executive board
so small as to work quickly, and with absolute control of every
industry and every workingman in this country. That is what we
want in Montana. And we want to organize the industries locally
into a central body in order that there may be back of each local
body all the force of the central body. That is the plan that I
wanted to offer to this convention, and you would not let me do
it. Now, I am going to go back to my constituents and tell them
what was done here, and see what will happen down there. I
don&rsquo;t want to see any more debate on this. Every man knows
how he is going to vote, and for God&rsquo;s sake proceed with
the constitution if you are going to have it.</p>
<p>Delegate Murtaugh was recognized.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I object, because he has spoken twice.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I rise to a question of personal privilege. Did
I talk twice?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You cannot till all other delegates who wish
have spoken.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Then this gentleman ought to be seated.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Murtaugh, have you spoken twice?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I have not.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Yes, he has.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I have not.</p>
<p>The Delegate: I appeal to the stenographer&rsquo;s report on
it. He has spoken a couple of times.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I have not. I understand just as well as
anybody the limitations of parliamentary law. I have held myself
in repression for a long while, and I have listened to the
vaporings of others.</p>
<p>Another delegate objected to the use of the term
&ldquo;vaporings,&rdquo; and the stenographer&rsquo;s report was
again appealed to.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair takes the position that the delegate
has not spoken on this question. If I remember rightly he did
rise to a point of order and attempted to make a speech. Delegate
Murtaugh has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Mr. Chairman, I wish to be as brief as
possible. I know that in some intelligences I am going to be
understood, but to the great composite intelligence of this
organization I believe that in a very few words I can make myself
clear. I tried to get it in before on a question of personal
privilege and failed. I want to say this simply, that in my
estimation there has been absolutely nothing said by either side
upon the question under discussion for so long that would not
apply equally to either side. (Confusion). I cannot speak without
having attention paid to me. I am going to try to be brief. I say
this, that the grouping that has been attempted there and the
other groupings that have not been plainly outlined by the
opposition mean practically the same thing. It means the
recognition, as Delegate De Leon expressed it, of the present
divisions in the crafts or the present tools that we use, and the
only difference between the two factions was a difference in
degree and not a difference of minds, as to how they should be
grouped. We get into that state of mind, Mr. President,
necessarily on account of the limitations that are put upon us by
the environment in which we are born and raised. When we come
into a convention of this kind that embraces every shade of
opinion, necessarily each and every shade of opinion expressed
here must be something coming from the environment of the
particular individual that expresses that shade of opinion. We
can expect to get into just such a tempest in a teapot as we have
been in for the past twenty-four hours. I want to say further,
Mr. President, that the Preamble adopted by this convention
expressed just as much of the aspirations of this convention as
was possible for the composite intelligence of this convention to
express, and that when an organization could be formed it was
inevitable that we got into just such a muddle. I want to say
further, that I have been very much surprised to find myself a
revolutionist among revolutionaries, when I thought that I was a
conservative of conservatives, and just take this as my
individual conception of what a completely class-conscious
organization, with that expression of the kind of, solidarity
that is needed in an economic organization and should be, and
that should be this: The recognition of the fact that we have
certain very, very simple groups as represented by the trade, for
instance, that I belong to the molders, whose interests are
apparently in some minor instances separate and distinct from the
interests of anybody else who might happen to be working in the
particular shop or factory in which a molder is working. But I
want to emphasize the fact, Mr. President, that that interest is
no more emphasized by the fact that we wish to retain our local
organization of molders or any other craft, than it is by the
chart placed before us there, where we apologize for our present
system of organization by saying that this is not an expression
of solidarity, irrespective of what the capitalists say, that
this is not an expression of the solidarity that we should have
in the labor movement. And I want to say that if you are going to
have solidarity in the labor movement you are not going to have
thirteen groups, any one of which may become powerful, but you
are going to have just one expression of solidarity. It is going
to be contained in the centralized government of the organization
here formed, and, you are not going to have the danger that there
is now within the American Federation of Labor of the withdrawal
of the United Mine Workers or the Iron Molders or the Machinists
or any other organization, and they could withdraw to-morrow out
of the American Federation of Labor, or some of them. You are
going to have an organization in which each and every individual
unit of that organization has something at stake; an organization
that will not only inculcate the principles of solidarity and
class-consciousness, but in which the individual units composing
that organization, irrespective of how you organize the local,
has something at stake nationally and internationally, and
won&rsquo;t withdraw. Mr. President, I believe that without going
into further details, that expresses my idea. And I wish to offer
as a substitute for the whole&mdash;I believe embracing the
idea&mdash;I do not believe that it will do away with the work of
the Constitution Committee; I believe that they will grasp the
idea, and I believe that on account of the respectful attention
that has been given me they have grasped the idea, no matter how
imperfectly stated. I hope we will get ourselves out of this
muddle and get into a completely class-conscious, solid
organization of the workingmen such as we express in our
Preamble, and not offer an apology to any form of capitalism or
craft organization now extant. I will offer it here:
&ldquo;Resolved, That Section 2 be referred back to the Committee
on Constitution with instructions to endeavor to bring in a plan
combining local craft autonomy with absolute solidarity
nationally and internationally expressed.&rdquo; (Seconded).</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I have had the floor once, but I would like to
have it five minutes to see if I cannot cover the points that I
did not cover in my previous talk to the convention.</p>
<p>(Chairman Haywood resumed the chair).</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: A point of order. We cannot consider the
substitute.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The substitute is that Section 2 be referred
back to the Committee on Constitution with instructions to bring
in a plan combining local craft autonomy with absolute solidarity
nationally and internationally. You have heard the amendment to
the amendment. Are you ready for the question? (Question called
for). Those in favor of the amendment to the amendment will
signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is lost. The
question occurs on the amendment to Section 2, that is the one
introduced by Delegate Coates, which it would probably be well to
read, as none of the delegates have spoken to it lately.
&ldquo;It shall be composed of national and international unions
embracing all workers of an industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Del. Glasgow took the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Is all debate shut off? If so, I am perfectly
willing to take my seat. If not, I wish to have the floor for an
amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have suggested a hard proposition to the
chair. The chair at this time would like to tell you a falsehood
if he could, but the debate has not been closed, and you have the
floor.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates to the
convention: I wish to say a word in behalf of a vast army of
laborers in this country, the vast army of laborers that are not
organized&mdash;the man who ought to have the chuck-steak or
joint but get poor soup principally&mdash;in his behalf. In
glittering generalities it has been pointed out here that they
would be vastly benefited by the adoption of this constitution
without amendment, or that portion of it that was before the
house, and also as proposed to be amended by Delegate Coates.
Now, as one who came from that class, but at the present time is
in organized labor and has been for nearly twenty-five years, I
wish, to state that that class is pretty thickheaded. I know
that, because I am from that class. I wish to state here and now
that unless you can point out specifically wherein we are going
to be benefited, the particular class from which I came, it will
be utterly impossible in the future, as it has been in most
instances in the past, to have them with you as an organized body
whatsoever. They are the ones who work for small pay. They are
the ones who to-day need to have the work started going. If you
pick the brainy skilled worker, you will be helpless unless you
throw away your pride and your coat collar and get down into the
bottom of the sewer or into the hole that is commonly called an
excavation for a building on which the structure is to be
erected, or whatever it may be. Now, for my part, I can see
nothing very encouraging in the plan presented by your
Constitution Committee, and I can see nothing in the amendment as
presented by Delegate Coates. This is the first time I have
raised my voice in this convention, either for or against any
proposition that has confronted you, but I feel that I would be
false to my particular class if I sat on my chair and refused to
raise my voice in their behalf. I have looked over, as carefully
perhaps as I will do in the future, the proposed plan as
presented by an individual delegate, Brother Fairgrieve of
Montana. I have also looked casually over a plan as presented by
my Brother delegate Critchlow, representing the International
Laborers&rsquo; Union. Whether either one is exactly what my
class, in my opinion, would want, I do not know; but there is
provision made specifically for my particular craft in each of
their plans, and I ask you now, in the name of over twenty
millions of people, have you presented, any of you, any specific
plan for that class of which I am a member?</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Certainly; sure.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: I see nothing whatever only glittering
generalities. Now, we wish, all that are in this position, you
would show us some plan by which we can save ourselves. Now, we
don&rsquo;t want to have to say, like our good fellow Christians
say, that Christ will save us, or as many trade unionists say and
I have heard them say, that Brother De Leon will save us, and
Brother Eugene V. Debs can save us, and Mother Jones, and Brother
Samuel Gompers has got a plan that will save you.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegate will confine himself to the
question.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: All right, Mr. Chairman; I have said all I want to
say in the general way in which I have spoken. I am coming right
back to that part of it for one minute, and that is this: I hope
that the good sense of this convention will prevail and vote down
that particular part as presented by the Constitution Committee,
and also the amendment presented by Brother Coates, and we will
then endeavor right here in committee of the whole to submit a
proposition to cover that particular phase of the
constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. CRITCHLOW: I want to speak on the question before the
house, although it was not my intention to do so. I do not want
to speak for the purpose of finding out where I am at, because I
know where I am at and I know where my organization is at. But I
am afraid that there are some of us that don&rsquo;t know where
we are at. Now, then, the one point of difference between these
two contentions for consideration has never yet been touched, and
I cannot understand how all this discussion has gone on without
touching that point. If that is an industrial union, then our
organization is not in favor of that industrial unionism. That is
not what they stand for. That organization as proposed there is a
departmental organization, nothing more nor nothing less. That is
not necessarily an industrial organization. The printing industry
cannot be organized as a printing industry on industrial lines in
that form of organization. The printing industry as such&mdash;I
think that is the main contention here&mdash;would be divided
into the different groups to which it was most closely allied and
made subservient to the management of those groups. That is the
contention at issue. The bakery business, as so cleverly brought
out here a moment ago, would not necessarily have an industrial
bakery workers&rsquo; union under that form of organization, but
it would be an organization divided into the groups of trades
most closely allied and made subservient to the management of
those groups. If that is the proposition it will forever preclude
the possibility of this organization organizing the bakery
workers or another similar organization. The time has not yet
come in the development of the union movement in this country
that that form of organization can be made a success. It has been
remarked here on the floor, in contradistinction to that
argument, that the capitalist industries at this time have
reached that stage. Suppose that to be true, is it not a fact
that the capitalist industries have reached that stage by reason
of the fact that through the breaking down of their different
lines of capitalist exploitation they have developed surplus
capital which has of necessity forced it to go into other lines
of business for the purpose of exploitation, thereby
necessitating the formation of other industrial groups? Now,
then, it seems to me to be an impossibility to jump from a craft
organization into a group of organizations. It seems to me that
we have of necessity to pass through the industrial form of
organization. The proposition submitted against that proposition
of the committee is a proposition to organize on legitimate
industrial lines and recognize legitimate industrial
organizations embracing the workers in any given and specific
industry. There is no one so foolish as to believe that an
intelligent man of sound judgment cannot determine whether any
industry is an industry or not. It seems to me that if I go back
to my organization and submit a proposition like that, they will
wipe out the industrial declaration in their constitution. That
is a part of their declared program to-day. They will say that
they do not understand the industrial constitution or what
industrial unionism means, if that is the position of the
industrial unionists&rsquo; convention. Industrial unionism, as
we understand it, is an organization in any given line of
industry embracing the workers in that industry, and that is
nothing more or less than the contention of Delegate Coates. Now,
then, that contention of Delegate Coates will conflict with that
proposition there; because for instance the Typographical
Union&mdash;I say that because I understand that he is a
typo&mdash;will of necessity be so divided and separated into
different groups with which it is most closely allied as to
become subservient to the organizations, and we have learned from
experience in our organizations that that will not be tolerated.
Now, I would like to take up the question of the previous
speaker, but I will not digress to that extent. I would like to
tell at some time during this convention the different problems
that have confronted us in organizing the laborers of this
country; because the experience that we have gained and the fact
that we are the only powerful organization of laborers on an
international scale in the world, so to speak, would I believe be
of interest and of vast importance to this assemblage. But on the
question now at issue I will simply say this, that if that
proposition stands our organization certainly is not nor cannot
be an industrial union, and we did not know in the first place
what we were doing when we sent representatives here.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If the convention will permit the chair, I do
not believe that I have spoken on any question that has come up,
and it is not my intention to speak at this time, but I would
like to appoint Delegate Sherman here to act as Chairman long
enough for me to make a motion.</p>
<p>(Delegate Sherman took the chair).</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: This motion is that Section 2 of Article 1 be
referred back to the Committee on Constitution with instructions
to specifically satisfy and perform that part of the Manifesto
providing for &ldquo;craft autonomy locally, industrial autonomy
internationally, and working class unity generally.&rdquo; Just a
few remarks in favor of this motion. I am opposed to the
amendment offered by Delegate Coates. I am not altogether in
favor of this subdivision, only inasmuch as it provides for a
general administration over this organization. When the members
of the Constitution Committee said that there were probably fifty
industries in this country, then I say that this Manifesto
provides for those fifty industries (applause) and that this
organization should be broad enough in its scope to take in every
one of them; that this is not a departmental organization; that
this Constitution Committee should, as nearly as they can carry
out the sense and sentiment of the Manifesto. In my opinion,
Division 13, wherein you have grouped together all of those
industries which are covered by and may be termed public
service&mdash;you have included the great) printing industry in
that division. The constitution does not provide for
international central autonomy for the printing industry. I
insist that it should provide for it. And I would like it not
only for the printing industry, but for every other industry that
is represented here and that we may bring into this organisation.
Now, I say that the printer has a craft. To what particular
industry does his craft belong? The printing industry is an
industry in itself, divided up into twenty or thirty different
crafts, and I take it that this organization is formed for the
purpose of giving to those different international unions
absolute industrial autonomy, to those local unions local
autonomy, and let every one of the local unions be installed with
the idea of giving to their members as nearly as they can
individual autonomy. I am in accord with this proposition as a
general proposition, that is in so much as it represents a
government, for instance, like the United States government,
where we have the department of the navy, the department of war,
the interior department, agricultural department, postal
departments and other departments. I am perfectly in accord with
a general administration of that kind. But that is not carried
out in the formation of this organization. And this government
with its different departments is carried into effect by
different States. Is it possible for the delegates here to
consider those different States as international industrial
unions, to carry into effect the aims and purposes of the general
labor movement which are represented by a central government? If
there are forty-five different international unions, they should
have absolute autonomy just the same as the State has from the
national government. Every county in the State&mdash;I mean every
local in an international, should have the same relative position
or maintain the same relative position towards its international
as the county does toward the State. That is my idea of building
up an international organization; one where we can have general
centralized administration in the general labor movement. But I
do not want the general labor movement to interfere with the
building up and the maintaining of any industry other than as it
affects the general labor movement. It has been said here a
number of times that the purpose of this organization is to take
over the means of production and distribution. Well, now, how
best can you teach the workers in any trade, class or industry as
to the aims and purposes and ability of those particular workers
other than by giving them absolute autonomy over the business
that they know best? Suppose, for instance, that instead of the
printers in this particular section here you had put the miners;
do you think we would agree to a proposition like that? Now, the
printing industry is an industry that is rapidly assuming such
proportions that it is of much greater importance than the
miners, employing more men. Therefore, I am in accord with the
contention that the delegate has raised who made the amendment,
that this plan is not correct. I again say that I am satisfied
with the plan as a general administration. I am not satisfied
with it inasmuch as it does not provide industrial autonomy for
the international organizations. Therefore I make a motion that
this particular section be referred back to the Constitution
Committee with an instruction to carry out the spirit and sense
of the Manifesto. (Seconded).</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN (DEL. SHERMAN): You have heard the amendment. Are
you ready for the question? Delegate Hagerty was recognized.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: Didn&rsquo;t you permit me to have the
floor?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN (DEL. SHERMAN): No, I was not in the chair when
you were recognized. This is an entirely different question, and
you had an entirely different Chairman. Now Delegate Hagerty has
the floor on this question, on this particular motion on the
question to refer back.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: It seems to me that that motion to refer
ought not to be put until the entire constitution is read and the
members find out whether provisions have been made for this
allowing of craft autonomy. I am opposed to the term &ldquo;craft
autonomy&rdquo; in its present interpretation. I do not think it
conveys the idea, or perhaps conveys the idea that the Chairman
has in mind, if he means by craft autonomy the A. F. of L.
interpretation. In that spirit I am opposed to the motion. I
oppose the motion on the general ground that it is not reasonable
enough, in view of the fact that the rest of the constitution,
which must necessarily interpret the preceding portions of the
constitution, have not yet been discussed, and we cannot
consistently accept, a reference, and I as one, if this committee
is compelled to rewrite this, shall withdraw from my previous
promise in that committee to support this thing as a whole. I am
going into this thing as a free lance, and support Brother
Hall&rsquo;s position from start to finish.</p>
<p>(Delegate Haywood resumed the chair).</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I only want to add a word or two on this matter
of referring. I want to say that I believe it is unfair to me,
after we have sat here all day long and listened to this argument
on the amendment, to adopt a motion that will prevent my arguing
or trying to explain or clear up, if you please, some of the
arguments that have been made here to-day. I have been sitting
here, Mr. Chairman, ever since nine o&rsquo;clock this morning,
taking notes from the speakers that I desire to answer, who I
believe have touched on this question, and I believe that this
convention is entitled to my interpretation of my amendment
before your motion comes in to refer. I have another reason, that
I believe that my amendment, if voted on, will test the sense of
the convention as to whether it wants to refer along the lines of
your motion. I mean that the original motion and the amendment
will settle the proposition here whether we shall have an
industrial organization or a departmental organization. And if it
decides to adopt my amendment, then your motion to refer back to
the committee to provide for industrialism will be absolutely
correct. My only contention is that the convention ought to
decide first whether it wants industrialism or
departmentalism.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A point of information. I would like to
have this new word that is coined here,
&ldquo;departmentalism,&rdquo; defined for this convention.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: You can define it if you like.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I request courteously that the delegate will
answer my question, and in the sense in which it was asked,
seriously and without persiflage.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman. I have been sitting here all day
long for that very purpose, and I really think that the Chairman
ought to withdraw that motion and let me cover this proposition,
and then I will, I believe, to the satisfaction of the delegates
define &ldquo;departmentalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;industrial
unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair would say to the delegate that in the
opinion of the chair the motion to refer opens up the
question&mdash;all questions under debate.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I was going to bring that very point out. Do I
understand that if I make a talk now as the mover of this motion,
then we will just simply go over the whole thing again; everybody
will answer me, and then you will give me the privilege of
answering them again?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, you haven&rsquo;t got any other
privileges.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I hold only the privilege of talking to this
motion to refer this resolution?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If you desire to talk to the question of
referring, the scope is broad enough to give you an opportunity
to present any arguments.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, the idea is that when I get through the
question is still open to every delegate?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is open to every delegate.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: And that includes me, of course.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It includes you.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes. Well, I am not going to say anything else
now.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Coates, the chair is not narrow in
regard to this. I have no objection to seeing the convention go
on record, and I am entirely willing to withdraw my motion to
refer until you conclude your argument.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, the, only point is that I believe the
amendment and the original motion will test the sense of this
convention whether it wants what I term industrialism or what the
other people term industrialism, and then it will be a proper
time to. send it back to the committee if it wishes, to carry out
that plan.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It does not so occur to the chair. Now, in the
event of the amendment being defeated, there is no reason why
this is going to be adopted. If this amendment was adopted I
still would make my motion to refer.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes, then your motion would be very properly in
order, but if my amendment was defeated and the committee&rsquo;s
report adopted it would not be.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The mere fact of the amendment being defeated
does not suggest that this report here is going to be adopted,
Brother Coates.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Not at all; not at all.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, with the consent of my second, I have no
objection to withdrawing the motion to refer at this time.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I withdraw the second.</p>
<p>Delegate Coates called for from different parts of the
hall.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: I move the previous question.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Coates has the floor.</p>
<p>Motion for previous question seconded.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: I understand that the report of this
committee is before the convention. That is correct, is it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Jut a minute. The amendment of Delegate Coates
is before the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: The original proposition?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The report of the committee as amended by
Delegate Coates.</p>
<p>Del. McDonald: Brother Coates made an amendment to the report
of the committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>Del.. McDonald: The amendment is before the convention in
addition to the report of the committee?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: Now I understand that there was a motion to
refer the entire proposition back to the Committee on
Constitution. Am I correct?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes. With the consent of the second the motion
has been withdrawn and the question now occurs on the Coates
amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: Well, I simply want to make this point, that to
refer the proposition was equivalent to the adoption of Brother
Coates&rsquo;s amendment, in my judgment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I thought so. I will state to Brother McDonald
that the adoption of this motion to refer, while it may have
seemed to be the equivalent of the Coates motion, it gives it
into the hands of the Constitution Committee to carry out the
provisions of the Manifesto.</p>
<h4>CLOSING ARGUMENT OF DELEGATE COATES.</h4>
<p>DEL. COATES: Now, Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I will
attempt, in the time that I shall occupy this floor, to confine
myself absolutely to the report of the committee and the
amendment made to that report. In order, to do that, I want to
get clear in the minds of the delegates here the report of the
committee, and on the construction of the report of the
committee. I do not want this audience to vote on the sayings, of
any supporter of this report, but on the report, and nothing
else. When the report of this committee is embodied in the
constitution, that is the law, and not the interpretations of the
framers, or rather of delegates upon this floor. Now, let us see
what the report is. &ldquo;Section 2. And shall be
composed&rdquo;&mdash;that is, this industrial organization, the
Industrial Workers of the World&mdash;&ldquo;shall be composed of
thirteen international unions, designated as follows.&rdquo; Mind
you, thirteen industrial unions is all that can make up this
organization. Now, the first industrial union is to be made up as
follows&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Divisions.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, sir, I am not talking about divisions. I am
talking about industrial unions that this report says shall make
up this organization. The first industrial union shall be made up
as follows: Clerks, salesmen&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A point of order. I object to the reading
of this with an exposition. Read it as the committee reports, and
not with interpolations. I object to your interpolations.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: May I read in a different word?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Read in &ldquo;division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, you read it.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No interpolation. Let us get it right. I demand
a reading of the report as it is, without any interpolations.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: The delegate has the language in his mind. Let
him read it.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No, sir; a point of order.. If he is quoting the
report of this committee, then let him quote it as the
report.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I never saw anybody that was afraid of a
discussion except the fellow that wanted to hide something. Now,
if there is anyone here that can get any other words out of this
report than I am reading I am willing to let him read it.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I simply maintain my point of order. If he is
going to read the report of the committee, let him read the
report of the committee, and not any interpolations.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegate will proceed to read the report as
he sees fit. If you have any corrections to make make them.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Now let me tell you what Delegate Hagerty is
trying to do.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: A point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, that is not necessary, Delegate Coates.
Confine yourself to the argument.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I was not going to make any personal
insinuations; not at all. There have been enough of those made. I
do not want to insinuate that anyone here is trying to be
dishonest, and I want to warn the delegate against insinuating
that I am dishonest in this thing. I will read that section
again. I am surprised that the language of this report has
stirred up so much trouble. &ldquo;Shall be composed of thirteen
international industrial unions, designated as follows.&rdquo;
Now, let me tell you that the report goes on and instead of
saying &ldquo;industrial union No. 1,&rdquo; it says
&ldquo;Division No. 1.&rdquo; That is what he was trying to get
me to say. And I want to say or I want to ask him why a
difference is made in thirteen industrial unions and thirteen
divisions. They absolutely mean one and the same thing; because
after we get through with these divisions there is not an
industrial union mentioned in here. Now, is that satisfactory,
that Division No. 1 means Industrial Union No. 1. I believe it
is. &ldquo;Industrial Union No. 1 shall be made up as follows:
Clerks, salesmen, tobacco, packing houses, flour mills, sugar
refineries,, dairies, bakeries and kindred industries.&rdquo; I
don&rsquo;t know what they mean by &ldquo;kindred
industries,&rdquo; I am free to confess.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Kindergartens.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I cannot understand where tobacco and bakeries
are kindred industries, and I do not know what other kind of
industries they are going to bring in under the word
&ldquo;kindred.&rdquo; Industrial Union No. 2, &ldquo;brewery,
wine and distillery workers.&rdquo; Get that correctly, fellow
delegates. An industrial union at last. &ldquo;Division 3,
floriculture, stock and general farming.&rdquo; That might
probably come under an industrial union. &ldquo;Division 4,
mining milling, smelting and refining coal, ores, metals, salt
and iron&rdquo;; a very proper industrial organization.
&ldquo;Division 5, steam railway, electric railway, marine,
shipping and teaming.&rdquo; I am not going to separate those
now, but a very improper industrial organization, in my opinion.
&ldquo;Division 6, all building employes&rdquo;; a proper
industrial organization. &ldquo;Division 7, all textile
industrial employes&rdquo;; a very proper industrial
organization. &ldquo;Division 8, all leather industrial
employes;&rdquo; a very proper industrial organization.
&ldquo;Division 9, all woodworking employes, except those engaged
in the building department.&rdquo; That will need perhaps some
further construction to fix more definitely its lines.
&ldquo;Division 10, all metal industrial employes&rdquo;;
perfectly proper. &ldquo;Division 11, all glass and pottery
employes&rdquo;; perfectly proper. &ldquo;Division 12, all paper
mills, chemicals, rubber, brooms and brushes, and jewelry
industries.&rdquo; A conglomeration that is not very proper.
&ldquo;Division 13, parks, highways, municipal&rdquo;I suppose
that takes in the mayor and police and the rest of
them&mdash;&ldquo;postal service, telegraph, telephone, schools
and educational institutions, amusements, sanitary, printing,
hotels, barber employes, restaurant and laundry employes,&rdquo;
and the rest of them. Now, those are the thirteen industrial
unions that are to make up this organization, and none other. I
do not care particularly to lay stress upon the conglomeration of
the last division, but this one sticks out most glaringly. I want
to say that perhaps six of these divisions are proper. And then
in order to be sure that there could not be any more than
thirteen organizations, all the rest of them are bunched into
three or four other international industrial unions. I want to
repeat that it is a most impracticable grouping of these
organizations in a union. System? Somebody said system. Somebody
said that this was a systematic grouping. I want to say that
there is absolutely no system in it, except perhaps as it applies
to four or five or six of the divisions as mentioned. I am
satisfied the intention and the purpose of this committee was to
divide these groupings as far as representation on the Executive
Board was concerned; and I want to say to you that if they had
done that, perhaps we would have had no particular objection to
it. We might have tried to straighten this thing out in a limited
way, but it would not have been the serious question that it is
now. And that as it comes here, comes on interpretation, and I
want to say it is widely different, and I want to call the
attention of this convention to what I believe the two different
explanations of this report make. I shall quote them the nearest
to my belief of what they said, and if I misquote anybody I have
no purpose to misinterpret what they did say. Delegate De Leon
said that my amendment which provided for industrial
organizations was a most drastic measure; that it meant the
destruction of a great many now national and international
organizations. And I took from that that he intended that they
should stay just exactly the way they are; that the printers, the
stereotypers, the restaurant employes, barbers and so on, should
stay absolutely as they are at the present time. And then
somebody accused us of advocating the A. F. of L. system. I want
at the present time to contrast that now with the other
interpretation of what I claim, this explaining of this report by
Delegate Sherman. Delegate Sherman just took the opposite view
from Delegate De Leon. Here you are, with the two interpretations
of the very men on this committee, and we are expected to go out
and agree on these things. Delegate Sherman just took the other
view, that practically every international organization should be
wiped out of existence, and then they have one great central body
absolutely operated from this Executive Board with central power.
Now, which interpretation of this thing are you going to take?
Delegate De Leon, who wants the organizations carried on as they
are now, retaining all their trade and craft autonomy, bringing
into this organization all the contentious and disrupting
quarrels about trade jurisdiction and autonomy, or do you want to
wipe out absolutely all the organizations and bring them into one
general administration? I want to say to you frankly that I would
prefer the latter one, eventually bringing the A. F. of L. bodily
into this organization. I am satisfied, Mr. Chairman and Fellow
Delegates, that the whole interpretation of the various members
of this committee in support of their report has been predicated
upon the proposition that they are simply grouped as
representatives on the Executive Board. Why, they have gone so
far in their interpretation as to agree absolutely with my
amendment. I think every argument that there has been in
so-called opposition to my amendment has strengthened the
amendment, and the longer I listen to the arguments against it
the stronger it comes to me. Delegate Hagerty in his explanation
and also in answer to several questions put to him on this floor,
has said that every individual craft organization should have its
organization and its local and international autonomy.
Isn&rsquo;t that correct?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No, I did not use those words.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: What did you say? I am willing to be corrected. I
want to be fair about it.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Go on. When you get through I will speak.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, I don&rsquo;t think you will.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I believe I will.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: All right.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: You have misquoted me.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then this is the time to correct it.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Well, I merely say that I did not make the
statement that every craft should have its international
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: You did not say that?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No, I did not say that. I am positive. I do not
think it is the spirit of the Manifesto.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then if it has not been said, that is the
impression on this floor. While I may not use just exactly the
words that you used, that has been the interpretation that you
have put time and time again on this report; that the printers
should have their own organization; that the laundry workers
should have their own organization; and so on clear down the
line. And the impression has gone forth in this convention that
we were to have different industrial organizations under this
scheme of grouping. I want to show you, Fellow Delegates, that
that kind of interpretation is misrepresentation of this group,
and you have no right to make that interpretation when you leave
this convention after this report shall have been adopted. I read
you Division 13, including a great number of craftsmen or
wageworkers that absolutely have no kindredship or identity of
interest except the general identity of interest of every man and
woman who works for wages; and I want to show you that there must
be only one industrial union of this great Division 13, because
it says further down that only the presidents of these divisions
or industrial unions shall become members of the Executive Board.
I would like to read that section, if you please. (Section handed
to speaker by Delegate Hagerty). &ldquo;The general executive
board shall be composed of the General President, the General
Secretary-Treasurer, and one member from each industrial union as
provided for in Article II., Section I.&rdquo; I was in error,
and I want to confess it. As I remember that report, it said the
president of each one of these divisions should be a member of
the Executive Board. I find that it simply says a member of these
divisions. Now, there is not very much difference.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Look on, and it does say the president.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: That was my impression, that that was in the
minds of the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: You are right, Brother Coates.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I thought I was right. But suppose you do not do
it that way; suppose there is only one of these groups, what does
that mean? It means that the laundry workers, the municipal
employes, the highwaymen&mdash;I mean the fellow that works on
the street (laughter)&mdash;and the fifteen or sixteen other
divisions in Division 13, shall gather together, or their
representatives shall gather together and select this member of
the Executive Board. Here I am; I have been selected to represent
Division 13. (Copy of the constitution handed to the speaker by
Delegate Moyer). &ldquo;Article II., Section I: The officers of
the Industrial Workers of the World shall be a General President,
a General Secretary-Treasurer and a General Executive Board
composed of the above named officers and the President of each
international industrial union.&rdquo; Then there is a
contradistinction or a difference right there in the report of
the committee. One place it says it shall be the president, and
the other place it says it shall be a member, and we certainly
cannot correct this after we adopt the report. That is where I
got my impression of it. But I am here; I belong to this grand
and glorious division of cooks and waiters, the highway employes,
the hotel and restaurant employes, the laundry workers, and
innumerable others. I am glad they did not put the &ldquo;kindred
organizations&rdquo; in there. And we have gathered together. I
think it provides a time when this member shall be selected.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I want to object to Brother Coates casting
slurring remarks as he does on the work of the Constitution
Committee. If he has any objection to its work it is all subject
to his criticism, but I object to his sneering remarks against
the Committee on Constitution. If we have erred in our judgment I
am willing to be criticised, but not in the sneering way that
Brother Coates has in presenting his argument to the convention.
(Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I would like to ask Brother Coates a
question. Is the whole constitution under discussion, or just
that motion that lie made yesterday?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I am not discussing anything except the report
and this amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I notice that you are discussing the
construction of that just now.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to apologize to the committee if they
think that I am sneering at their work. They put that in in one
of the sections, &ldquo;kindred organizations,&rdquo; and that
gave me the right very properly to refer to the other section.
They put the words in my mouth. I did not put them in theirs, and
I certainly shall not again refer to them in any way, if the
committee believe that I am sneering at their work, because I am
not.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I want to state for the information of Brother
Coates that I have no objection to referring to &ldquo;kindred
organizations,&rdquo; but I do object to the tone in which he
mentioned that part of the committee&rsquo;s work. That is what I
referred to. (Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, I will have to use my own tones.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: Very well.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Now, I am here. But first I am going to say that
this latter section is one not showing the composition of the
Executive Board, that it shall be the presidents of those great
industrial organizations. First let us take that first feature,
that he must be the president of this Division 13; then there
must only be one organization to elect him president. How can he
be president of a division? How can he be president of this
industrial union division, if there is more than one industrial
organization in that division? How can he be? I will just leave
that point right there. And it is an impossibility to claim that
he is president of this division, for there would be more than
one organization in that division. Isn&rsquo;t that true? Now we
will leave the president go, and we will come back to the other
feature; that means the election of a member of this
division.</p>
<p>I said a few moments ago that I had been selected to represent
Division 13, because I am classified as a wageworker under that
division. I am a printer; I have been working at it all my life,
and I will be when I get back and go to setting type. But I want
you to keep this in mind: The cooks and waiters, the laundry
workers. the printers, the highway worker, the municipal worker
and the other innumerable crafts under Division 13, have gathered
together through their representatives as is provided there, and
they elect a representative on the Executive Board. I am the
fellow. I am a printer. A question of serious difficulty comes up
among the hotel and restaurant employes. I am representing those
fellows. &ldquo;Coates the General Executive Board is confronted
with this proposition. The hotel and restaurant employes are
trying to improve their conditions in their vocation. Now, as a
representative of this organization detailed to see to the
conditions of the hotel and restaurant employes, we want this
Executive Board to act instantly on this proposition.&rdquo; I
say, &ldquo;Well, you fellows forget that I am only a printer. I
have never worked in a hotel or restaurant in my life, and I know
absolutely nothing about their conditions in the kitchen and in
the dining room.&rdquo; What an elegant representative I am of
those people. What a beautiful representative I am, to go to the
General Executive Board, which, on my representation of the case
or misrepresentation of the case, shall decide perhaps to
paralyze the industries of this country. I want to tell you that
the printer can absolutely be nothing but a misrepresentative of
the case of the laundryman, or the highwayman or the workers in
any other line. (Applause) I want to tell you that any other
fellow that would be selected for that group would be in
identically the same position that I am. Suppose we sent a
laundry girl, if you please, as a representative on this
Executive Board, and the question of the typesetting machine
operator is in controversy.</p>
<p>DEL. BRIMBLE: I would like to ask a question. Do you think the
printer would not know anything about what these other people
want? There would be no sense in saying he would not know. It is
an insult to their intelligence.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I think I have possibly as much sense as others
on this floor, and I do not think there was any insult to the
gentleman at all. I simply want to show you, my friends, and my
whole purpose is to show you how ridiculous and impracticable, as
I said in the beginning, this sort of grouping is. That brings me
to the first proposition, as I remember it, that Brother De Leon
gave out.</p>
<p>He says that the idea of making these groupings is to make a
central power of quick action. Well, if the Executive Board
wanted to get quick action, when they asked me as a
representative of the cooks and waiters what I knew about their
craft, that quick action would mean sending absolutely back to
the cooks and waiters and getting them to the Executive Board and
chewing the whole rag about the whole business. That is where you
would get your quick action. It would merely mean the gathering
together of this Executive Board, and not having the information
at hand, and then sending back to the seat of difficulty for a
committee or something of that kind to come up. That would be
your quick action. And then he goes on to say that for that very
reason the dividing us into forty industrial organizations is too
slow and long. I want to say to you that if the industries of
this nation can be divided up into forty&mdash;yes, into two
hundred&mdash;you can gather together in a central point the two
hundred just as quick as you can the thirteen that are provided
for in this report. The chances are that the entire hundred would
not have any further to travel than would the thirteen members,
and then absolutely we would have together every man that
represented an industry in this organization, and your quick
action would come then. He not only would be prepared as a direct
representative of that industrial organization, but he would have
already been made cognizant of the struggle that is going on in
his industry, and he would be equipped with absolute, full
knowledge upon that question and could discuss and vote
immediately. And so I say your argument for a small executive
board that can by misrepresenting hurt the people that they are
selected to represent, would be much slower in action than would
be a committee of 40 or 50 or 150, made up directly from the
industrial organizations. His next statement as a member of the
committee that was important to this convention was that we could
afford to adopt this method at the present time and let it stand
for a year. I believe, delegate, that if we adopt this system of
grouping and let it stand for a year, we will not have a single
organization back here in a year from now to discuss this thing
and change it.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I would like to ask you a question:</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: All right.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Do you say that the only objection you have to
this grouping is that there were not enough groups, and otherwise
you have no objection?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, you are wrong.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: According to my understanding of the report here,
you said that certain of these groups, the majority of them I
believe, were grouped perfectly.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Some of them are.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Well, in all those groups they have printers, and
much of the printing is not done by regular printing
establishments.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I was coming to that pretty soon. I touched upon
the proposition of wiping out all of these various organizations.
The argument of most of the brothers was that I meant to wipe
out, for instance, as an illustration, the printers union. The
organization that I would like to see in one industry is now
divided into twelve. I am not quite certain about that, but they
are divided up into reporters; they are divided up into pressmen
internationally, of two different kinds; they are divided up into
stereotypers, into typesetters, and the general organization
takes in typesetters of all kinds, but nevertheless there is a
group of eight or ten different organizations in the printing
industry. Delegate De Leon says that if we are to adapt my
amendment it means the wiping out of every one, practically, of
these organizations; and I want to say this, I absolutely agree
with him. That is exactly what I want to do. I want every man and
woman and kid that works in the printing industry to come into an
industrial organization. And while I am on that feature, I want
to say to that delegate here&mdash;I forget his name just now; he
did not call it&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Dinger.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Delegate Dinger says, and so did Delegate
Sherman, that printing practically is not done by printing; that
is, in a regular separate industry. He says the packing interest
and packing trust takes in every kind and character of worker. He
did no make it as broad as that, but he said several. He spoke of
printing; and consequently it will apply to that industry, as far
as the work in those industries. I don&rsquo;t think even they
carry that idea out in this grouping. They certainly do not. The
printer inn the packing industry will not be with the packers in
this grouping. But suppose he is. My proposition simply means
this, that every printer shall belong to the printing industry,
whether he works in the packing industry or the oil industry. But
just as soon&mdash;now, do not misunderstand me&mdash;but just as
soon as a department of that industry, for instance the packing
industry, has a serious grievance they send it on to this General
Executive Board for endorsement. They can not strike; they must
present their grievance, to this General Executive Board. Now,
the packing industry, under my proposition, and the printing
industry are separate, industries, and they are in two separate
organizations. Under the present scheme of organization in the A.
F. of L. the Executive Board could endorse the packers&rsquo;
strike and the printers would not have to come out. But under my
plan, just as soon as the General Executive Board was notified
that the packers had a serious grievance and they endorsed that
grievance to the extent of authorizing a strike, before they
could send out their order they would immediately notify the
industrial organization of printers that had its members there,
that when the packers struck every other member of this great
organization should strike in that one industry. (Applause) They
would not order out the entire printing industry, but this
Executive Board would say to us, &ldquo;Mr. Printer in the
packing house, come out just as soon as the packers come out in
that house.&rdquo; There you have an absolutely perfect working
organization, and at the same time keep these separate industries
separate and distinct.</p>
<p>It has been stated time and time again, and I think Delegate
De Leon led off in the statement&mdash;at least I have him so
reported here&mdash;that this grouping is practically laid down
in the Manifesto. I do not mean by that that he said that the
grouping on the wheel in the Manifesto was a part of the
Manifesto; no. But he claimed that this system of organization
was practically outlined in the Manifesto. I want to take issue
with him on that proposition. The Manifesto, I believe, was
adopted solely and wholly without a solitary dissenting voice in
that convention called for the purpose of organizing
industrially, as industrial organizations. Delegate Smith told
you yesterday that it was. And if you will read the section in
the Manifesto applying to this you will find that the Manifesto
is absolutely and unequivocally unmistakable upon that
proposition. The Manifesto provides for industrial organization
internationally and craft autonomy locally. That is, it means
that the printing industry shall be in one national organization
with power over every one of its various divisions of that
industry. That is all my amendment means.</p>
<p>And that is where I come to the proposition that this is a
departmental organization. I wish to say to you that if we are to
have a president of this department to be a member of this
General Executive Board, that there must be only one organization
of that department. That is where my amendment differs. My
amendment simply says that it must be made up of international
and national industrial organizations made up of wage workers in
any industry. Some one said, I believe, in the argument, that
that was indefinite, that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand any
such thing as that.&rdquo; Some one cried out that this system
and the amendment are absolutely indefinite. Can there be
anything indefinite in saying that every man and woman in the
printing industry shall belong to the printers&rsquo; industrial
union, and every man in the packers&rsquo; industry shall belong
to their industrial union, and every toiler in the mining
industry shall belong to the mining industrial union? Not at all.
It seems to me the clearest and the best proposition or provision
that you can put into this constitution. The reason I did not
name specifically every man or every wage worker that should go
into that industrial union was that I might overlook some, or I
might put some temporarily over in another industry, and when
this industrial organization is made up and comes in to this
organization for a Charter the Executive Board can very properly
look it over and grant it and transact all these things according
to circumstances. If there is any organization that gets into an
into an industry where it does not belong, it is only a question
of time when experience will teach them and teach this general
organization the right place in another industrial group, and it
will go there entirely without any contention, because they will
go where they can get the best protection.</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: I want to submit just one question. You said
the textile workers group was all right.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: As far as I know.</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: Would a clothing cutter keep on working as a
textile worker? I am a clothing cutter, and we have a better
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I have not time to go through all these other
divisions to answer the many questions that might be asked.</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: I ask the question, will my trade, the
clothing cutters, be divided from the textile workers?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Certainly, I do not include the textile workers
with the clothing workers.</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: It is included there.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then it is a mistake, I think. Now the next
proposition. I don&rsquo;t want to be too long, but, delegates,
this is a serious proposition to settle without an understanding.
I maintain now, as I maintained yesterday, that the formation of
this organization means its success or its failure, and I can
afford to stay here tomorrow arguing this question of the
formation of this organization.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Let me ask one question, and it may
probably clear up a doubt that I have in my mind. Will you kindly
define &ldquo;industrial union?&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: To a certain extent I have tried to do that.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: You call a packing house an industry,
don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Well, you say the printers in the packing all
belong to the printing industry?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: There are lots of other industries in the
packing house industry, and each worker would have to be a member
of his particular organization in the packing industry, so there
would really be no packing industry.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: My point was simply this, that only the people
who are directly allied shall come into an industrial
organization. For instance, the printers&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Let me ask a question.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Let me finish, please. I want to finish my
answer, and you can keep on as long as you please; because I am
not going to be swept off my feet by a few questions. I want to
answer that by saying this, that as far as it is possible, as far
as it is practicable, the workers in an industry will find their
own union. And if, sir, there are twelve or fifteen or a hundred
other craftsmen that do not properly, from a craft standpoint,
belong in that industry, they will belong to another under which
we shall have control and under which we shall control them as I
outlined with the printers in the packing house.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: The delegate is using the printers as an
illustration. Is it not a fact that in the printing industry you
have photoengravers and so forth? Where would you attach me?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I put them in their own organization. That is, I
should think that the printer will belong to the international
union of that trade. Brother Critchlow seems to think that the
printer must cease work when he ceases work. I cannot see for my
life on what principle he would expect that. But here is an
all-powerful organization; it is not going to let one craftsman
work in an industry when it calls another one out.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: When a printer works in another industry, is the
printer&rsquo;s trade subsidiary in general to the industry?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: It is only subsidiary in a small degree.</p>
<p>The Delegate: Aren&rsquo;t there many among the other
industries, for instance the packing, divided among them all?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Only very insignificantly so.</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: Is it not generally so?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, Sir. I will guarantee that out of two or
three hundred thousand people in the printing industry there is
not a thousand working outside of that industry among other
industries.</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: Is it not a fact that the printers working in
the packing houses have particular grievances to adjust that do
not arise in the printing industry in general?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I could not answer as to them. But if you
organize them industrially they won&rsquo;t. That is exactly the
reason I don&rsquo;t want the packers to stop work without the
printers in that industry stop. I want them all together.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: You referred to the magnificent organization to
which the brother in the chair belongs. Does it not occur to you
that the time is not far distant when the timber of this country
is going to be obliterated, and the timbering now in the mining
industries is going to be done by iron? Now, I want to ask you if
those who set those iron bracers and those who prepare the iron
for the bridge and bench and rivet and the material that goes
into the mines&mdash;whether they would belong to the metal
industry or whether they would belong to the mining industry.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, sir, I want to say that if their work came
under the head of the skilled crafts of the metal industry, that
is exactly where they belong. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Del. Veal: I desire to ask Delegate Coates a question. He has
used the term industrial unionism. The United Mine Workers to-day
is made up of tributary bodies of miners in branch groups, but
they have not industrialism. We want to know about industrialism.
Is it industrialism without any mention of the class struggle?
Are we to lose sight of the industrial revolution? I want him to
make specific what he means by industrial unionism.</p>
<p>DEL.COATES: I mean the industrialism that is behind that, the
class struggle. Now, let me take up the Arkansas hog. I believe I
can use it very nicely on that question. I think it was Delegate
O&rsquo;Neil that introduced the Arkansas razorback hog, and he
told you that when a capitalist or some fellow who wanted to
capture that hog&mdash;I suppose he meant the capitalist by that
illustration&mdash;when he chased the hog it ran to a group of
its fellows, and they put up their tails, or had a strike as you
might say, and their entire bodies came into a kind of solid
organization and whipped the capitalist. Now, I want that kind of
a razorback hog, but when that razorback hog runs I want him
absolutely to run here, and I want to see him fight as a whole
hog. I want him to run this general organization as an industrial
hog. I want him to run here, for instance, as a printing
department hog. I don&rsquo;t want his tail to be a dishwasher. I
don&rsquo;t want his hind leg to be a municipal worker. I
don&rsquo;t want his other hind leg to be a laundry worker. I
don&rsquo;t want his head to be nothing but a candy maker. I want
his grunt simply to be the mouthings of the printer; ,I want him
to be a printer&rsquo;s hog. And then in order to have the class
struggle behind that industrial hog, I want him to do just like
the razorback hog of Arkansas does. He comes to his fellow hogs
and he gets them all together and he defies the capitalist class
as a class. (Applause.) That is what I mean by an industrial this
organization. That is what I mean by the class struggle
underlying this organization.</p>
<p>DEL. LILLIAN FORBERG: According to your statement in the
beginning you stated that the printers belonged in a separate
industry by themselves. A moment ago, in answering a question,
you said, for instance, that the stenographers and clerks and
typewriters that were engaged in the printing industry would
belong to their separate organizations and not to the
printer&rsquo;s union.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. FORBERG: Now, that being the case, isn&rsquo;t that
exactly the same form of organization that we have at he present
time, so far as the printers are concerned? (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to say no. I am very glad you cheered, but
I want to say no. I want to say to you that instead of twelve or
seven, as there might be, divisions in the printing industry,
there should only be one organization in the printing industry.
It was Delegate De Leon that wanted the same craft organizations
that we have now.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: N-o-o ! Not by a jug-full!</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: That is what you said. I want to say that his
very language and the interpretation of this group is such. He
said, &ldquo;I don't want to destroy these unions.&rdquo; That
meant that the amendment would destroy them. I want to say to you
that as far as the typewriters and the stenographers in that
department were reporters or editorial writers in that department
I would say that they belong to the printing department, but if
they are simply stenographers taking the dictation of somebody in
that department, or typewriters, then they belong to the
stenographers and typewriters&rsquo; organization, to be taken
out with the printers when they strike through their
international organization. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: Didn&rsquo;t you say you came two thousand
miles to this convention to organize all the working class, and
not the labor crafts?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to say as far as I understood the
question, the first part, did I come two thousand miles to help
organize this union, I want to say yes, and I can afford to
travel several more thousand miles to organize it right rather
than see it organized wrong. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SAINER: Would you place the machinists and molders along
with some other crafts by the side of the printers?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: If I did I would misrepresent them. But it is the
same principle; I would apply the same principle to the
machinists and the molders as to the printers, and I will tell
you why; I would not undertake to represent them because I do not
know anything about the machinery business. But as there are
intelligent men in the machinery and molding business, I would
follow the same general principle, and they will get into that
line of industrial organization that they deem correct for
them.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHWARTZ: Don&rsquo;t you believe there is a difference
between men in different lines of work?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: The question is, do I not believe that there is a
difference in workingmen. For instance, this way, to put the two
extremes: The question is, do I believe there is a difference
between the street sweeper and the locomotive engineer? I am
trying now to give you the two extremes. No. I want to say to you
that I believe that the street sweeper who works want for the
health of the people and the life of the people, is just as
essential as in the locomotive engineer that draws you from one
end of the country to the other. (Applause.) I want to say to you
that all my life in the trade union work my aim has been to put
absolutely upon an equality every man and woman who work by their
daily toil for their living. I wish the street sweeper could get
the wage of the locomotive engineer, and I wish the engineer to
get the full product of his toil. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Isn&rsquo;t the section man worth as much to
society as the engineer?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I have just said he was.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Let Brother Coates proceed with his argument.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: There was a remark made this morning, and I took
it very personally, that while I was sincere and honest, I was
simply bounded by my conditions. I just want to say to this
convention that I will put my soundness on economics on the plane
of any other man&rsquo;s soundness on economics in this
convention, I don&rsquo;t care who he may be. (Applause). I
don&rsquo;t want this organization for you alone. I want it for
me. Now, that ought to satisfy you. Now, Delegate De Leon said,
in talking about my statement of yesterday that when the
capitalists wanted to organize a railroad they organized a
railroad company, and when they wanted to organize a newspaper
they organized a newspaper company,&mdash;he said that I was
blind to the fact that they were simply organizing the newspaper
to support the railroad company. I want to say that perhaps that
will apply merely to a few instances. The brother says that when
a great number of capitalists organize a company they organize it
because of the surplus that they want to earn more dividends, and
they go into some other industry because they want it to support
the original industry that they are in. And in that statement he
went on to say that his grouping was in line with the economic
development.</p>
<p>(A hiss was heard in the hall.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Did you hiss then, Mr. De Leon?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: You know it was not I, Mr. Coates.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: No, it was I. I wanted one of the comrades to keep
quiet so that I could hear your argument.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I thought he was thinking that I had made a
misstatement. I want to take issue with them on that point. I
want to say that the motion that I have made for the industrial
organization is absolutely in line with the economic development
of even capitalism. I want to maintain the same position that I
took last night, that when these capitalists go into a separate
and distinct industry they operate it as a separate and distinct
industry. They may perchance support each other, and Delegate
Hagerty, I believe, said in support of that theory that when the
teamsters went to the employers, Siegel, Cooper &amp; Co., I
think he said, for a settlement of their difficulty, they
referred them to the Citizens&rsquo; Alliance, or rather
Employers&rsquo; Association. And by that he meant to support the
idea that they are absolutely controlling all industries. I want
to say, my friends, that the thing I am attempting to get you to
do is the very thing that the capitalists are doing at the
present time. When they told the teamsters to go to the Employers
Association they did not say to them that this Employers&rsquo;
Association ran all these industries as a single group of
industries; of course not. They simply said to them that
&ldquo;We have finally come into a central body where we, the
various groupings of employers and capitalists, have thrown all
settlement of these difficulties into their hands.&rdquo; That is
the very thing that we want to do with them. When the capitalist
comes to the printer to settle his difficulty in his
organization, I want him to say to the employer&rsquo;s
representative, &ldquo;Go to the general executive board of the
wage workers representatives.&rdquo; (Applause). I want him to
say that &ldquo;We are organized economically just as you, sir,
are organized. While you divide your people up into industries as
you do, some of you operating dry goods stores and others
railways, we have done identically the same thing and we have
reached the same conclusion that you have reached, that this
struggle is a class struggle and we have to settle our
difficulties as a class.&rdquo; (Applause.) And I want to say to
you that we are absolutely on the same plane and are attempting
to organize on lines identical with the capitalist groupings and
the economic development of today. And again I will repeat, that
I will match my soundness upon this proposition with the
soundness of any other delegate, be he even Mr. De Leon.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Coates, will you permit the Chair to
ask you a question?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you regard the Western Federation of Miners
as an industrial organization?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, yes, in its general feature. I differ with
it, however, in some of its features.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, you have said to Delegate Sherman that in
the event of iron being used in place of timber to hold the
ground up, that you would grant to the structural iron workers
the right of jurisdiction over that craft in the mining industry.
Do I understand you to mean that that would carry out the ideas
of industrial unionism? (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I said, if the delegates will remember, and I
applied the same principle throughout clear through my
argument&mdash;I applied it to the timberman in that
instance,&mdash;talking about the metal worker, for instance,
that brought into the mine the metal to prop the sides of the
mine; I said very distinctly that if the work that was to be done
by the man who handled that metal compelled him to be a mechanic
sufficiently to place him side by side with the skilled metal
worker, that he belonged in the metal workers union; if it does
not, if it simply means drilling a hole as a common laborer, then
he belongs in the mining industry.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Permit the Chair to state that a common laborer
cannot drill a hole at all.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I think he can.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I want to ask a question with reference to
skilled work.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: What I mean was this, that if this metal worker
in the mine is simply a metal worker in the metal industry
without connection with some other feature of the mining
industry, then he belongs to the metal workers.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, I am going to ask this question: If, in
your opinion, the skilled blacksmith, the skilled engineer, the
skilled smelter, the skilled mill man, the assayer and the other
skilled mechanics, or the timberer around the mine, along your
line of reasoning, belong to their separate craft organizations,
and if they do, would it not destroy what we now are as an
industrial organization ? (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to say again, no. While I am on trial,
that must be my position. I am not afraid to do that. I want to
say no; for the reasons that I have said, that under this general
organization we are going to have a central power that will
compel these people to work together. It makes very little
difference to me, if you please, how many divisions we make in
this as long as we have that power; only I want the great mass of
people whose work is similar in any industry to belong to the one
general organization. Now, I want to say a word about this
Western Federation of Miners. It is not under discussion here,
and I don&rsquo;t want to discuss it fully; but the Western
Federation of Miners recognize that very principle right now
indirectly. Take, for instance, the city of Butte, Montana, and
you will find industrial organization. They have a number of
organizations, as somebody has pointed out, I believe Delegate
McDonald; they have the miners together; they have the pumpmen
together; they have the engineers together; they have the ropemen
together. But they have one central power that can force them all
together.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I wish to ask one question. Isn&rsquo;t that
precisely the same plan that the committee proposes, local
autonomy?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, no.</p>
<p>Adjourned until nine o&rsquo;clock July 6.</p>
