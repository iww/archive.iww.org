<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>NINTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Thursday, July 6</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>Chairman Haywood called the convention to order at nine
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: While we are waiting for the Secretary the Chair
will announce the committee selected to fill vacancies on the
Ratification Committee: M. E. White, Lynch, Starkenberg and Mrs.
Forberg.</p>
<p>On motion the roll call of delegates was dispensed with.</p>
<p>The Secretary read the minutes of the previous day, and they
were approved.</p>
<p>A communication was read from Local Union No. 9, Brewery
Workers; Milwaukee, contributing $25 toward the stenographic
report.</p>
<p>The Credential Committee and special committees had no reports
to make.</p>
<h4>REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTION.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Under the head of standing committees we will
take up the report of the Committee on Constitution.</p>
<p>Del. Kiehn: I make an amendment to the amendment of Delegate
Coates&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I rise to a point of order. As I understand it I
have the floor.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair will take the position at this time
that Delegate Coates has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I am not going
to try to delay you very much longer on this argument. I would
have been through before the closing adjournment last night if it
had not been for the great number of questions that were
continually asked me, and I will try to finish just as speedily
as I possibly can. In opening this morning I want to tell you an
experience I had before I had moved an inch from where I closed
speaking last night. Upon this stage day after day there has
appeared a reporter for one of the daily papers of Chicago. He is
the labor editor, if you please, of this paper, a very active
member of organized labor, and a very warm and enthusiastic
supporter of Samuel Gompers and the American Federation of Labor.
Before I had a chance to move he came to me and grasped my hand
and said: &ldquo;Coates, I know you are right in that, but I hope
to God you will not succeed.&rdquo; I understood him in a moment.
So do you. And then he added, &ldquo;If you do succeed it means
the complete success of this organization and the disintegration
of the American Federation of Labor.&rdquo; (Applause). He says,
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t succeed it means the failure of this
organization, and it means more supreme than ever the policy of
Sam Gompers and the American Federation of Labor.&rdquo; Now,
there is the testimony of one of their chief supporters and one
of the men who have attempted to ridicule this convention ever
since it has begun.</p>
<p>I want to say in that connection that this report of this
committee, if it is adopted as provided here in this chart, that
no matter how we may decide to interpret it in this convention,
there will not be an officer of a single national or
international organization in the American Federation of Labor
but what will interpret it in his own way to destroy this
organization. In my opinion, if they interpret it correctly they
will have sufficient force behind that correct interpretation to
destroy this organization and to prevent their membership coming
into it. My friends, they will not stick to a correct
interpretation as I understand it of this chart. They will
deliberately misrepresent the chart and this grouping of the
divisions in this new organization.</p>
<p>I want to touch just on one or two other points that were
brought out. Delegate Sherman, in his argument in favor of this,
said that if the amendment was adopted it simply meant again the
assembling of the various presidents of these various industrial
organizations as an executive board, and the matter of breaking
of contracts would come up in all these various industrial
controversies. Why, my friends, the whole foundation of this
organization is the class struggle, and it was understood that we
should not have a single solitary contract with any organization,
and that this executive board would have absolute and full power
to control instantly every organization making up this great
organization. So I cannot understand that argument.</p>
<p>Then comes again Brother Trautmann, and he says in his
argument that each industry shall have its own union. Now, that
is all I am contending for, and I am free to confess that most of
the men who have favored the committee&rsquo;s report practically
agree on that proposition. And, fellow delegates, I want you to
keep clear in your minds that I am not contending against the
interpretation of this constitution by the various people who
have spoken in favor of it, but I am trying to stick to the
wording of the constitution itself; and if that means that we
shall have industrial organizations under this organization, all
I want and all my amendment provides for is that the constitution
itself shall say it in distinct language. That is all I am
contending for. I might agree largely with their interpretation,
but I want the constitution so worded as to carry that out into a
fact, and that no interpretation may be needed by any individual.
If we are going to depend upon interpretations, how widely the
interpretations of the report have differed.</p>
<p>DEL. JAMES O&rsquo;NEIL: Delegate Coates, I wish to ask this
question.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: Not to confuse you or anything of the kind,
but I am seeking for information. For instance, I have worked
somewhat as a hoisting engineer in the mines. Suppose I am
working as an engineer in the mining industry and I have my card
in the mining industry. I go to work in the packing industry as
an engineer, and I deposit my card in the packing industry. I
believe that in each of these industries I have local autonomy,
but I am not represented except through the industry itself. Am I
to understand, or am I to infer rather from your argument, that
the craft should govern me where I am a member of this industry,
or shall the industry govern me?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Will you let me answer that later on, and I will
bring that point out.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: Yes. That is a question that is bothering
me.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Now, Delegate Hagerty tried to illustrate the
difference between two so-called industrial organizations. For
instance, he said that the Western Federation of Miners was an
industrial organization. Granted for the sake of argument. It
comes as near to it, I am satisfied, and nearer to it than any
organization that I know of now in existence And then he says the
United Mine Workers is an industrial organization, but it is tied
up with the identity of interest between the employer and the
employe. Why, that does not change its phase as an industrial
organization. We have declared that there is no identity of
interest between the employer and the employe.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Brother Coates, just a moment. I made that
distinction in order to clear the term in the Manifesto &ldquo;an
economic organization,&rdquo; and I believe I called the Western
Federation of Miners an economic organization and the United
Mitchell Workers an industrial organization. That is the sense of
the Manifesto.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: But you agreed that they were both identical in
form, except one recognized as we may say the class struggle, and
the other recognized the identity of interest of the employer and
the employe. Well, now, we are not going to have any such
distinction as that here. We cannot possibly have it. But let us
stick to the Preamble that we have adopted, that there is no
identity of interest and there cannot be possibly an identity of
interest between any division of this great organization and the
employers of labor. There is no autonomy of any division of this
organization when the general interest is at stake, as I wanted
to say last night when I got to the hog illustration. I did not
have time to finish exactly what I meant, when another question
was fired at me. But you will remember I said I did not want this
thirteenth hog divided up into a laundry worker&rsquo;s leg, a
musical union leg, a cooks and waiters&rsquo; leg, a
barber&rsquo;s leg, a printer&rsquo;s mouth, and so on. Why, if
you give us that kind of a razorback hog you simply transform him
into a woggle bug or tumble bug. This leg over here may switch
off or want to switch off as a cook and waiter. The other part
may switch off and want to be a municipal worker. I want that hog
to know absolutely what it wants. I want the hog to be an
industrial hog that knows absolutely, that is conscious of the
very thing that he wants to carry out in his industry solely and
done, and then I want him to back up with every other hog that
comes from all the other industries and make a solidarity class
struggle to meet the solidarity of the capitalist class.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: That is the capitalist hog you meant.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, I meant just what I said. Delegate Hagerty
said this chart is an economic grouping. I will not say anything
further about that. I think I tried to show yesterday that the
industrial organization is clearly in line with the economic
development at this time. It may be necessary after a while to
change this form of organization, and I want to say to you that
if this body is not broad enough in another few years to expand
itself to meet the economic development of its time, I will head
a movement, or join in a movement rather, to organize a new union
that will. I believe it will be broad enough to expand itself.
But if it is not broad enough to expand itself, then it simply
rests with some of us that do not agree with it to go out and
organize a movement that will conform with the economic
development of its time.</p>
<p>Now let me say just a few words on my amendment, and I will
try to cover your question in that, and then I will close. I said
at the beginning that the amendment simply meant that this
organization should be made up of industrial organizations. I
said at that time that I did not want to take the position, that
I do not believe it is proper for this convention to take the
position, of absolutely drawing the line as to every individual
in a single industry, as to where he belongs. That is exactly the
reason I made the amendment as broad as I did, because I did not
want to say, or I do not want to say, to the engineer in the
packing industry that if his experience teaches him that he does
not belong there as an effective force he should go there anyway.
I want that to be left to the experience of these organizations.
I want that to be left to the judgment of the Executive Board and
the managerial or administrative board of this organization to do
what we believe would be effective in an industry to-day, and we
might decide that it is for its more effectiveness and more
practicability that he should be shifted into some other
industrial organization, and I want this consideration, at least
at the beginning of this organization, to be left identically in
that position.</p>
<p>Del. Lillian Forberg: Under your plan of organization would
you advise any one of the trades that are organized, for
instance, in the Western Federation of Miners, to break away from
the miners&rsquo; organization and organize themselves as an
industrial union of engineers, we will say, independent of the
other lines in that industry?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, that is not my understanding or my
interpretation of it at all. And I want to say that from the
questions last night, fired at me as they were, there has an
impression gone out that that is exactly what I stood for. Now,
one of the last questions last night was about work around the
mines and whether the metal worker making the iron stulls to be
used instead of wooden stulls belonged to the mining industry or
not, and it seems to have made a false impression, which I could
have prevented if I had had time to stop and think. I said
repeatedly that I did not propose to draw a line or attempt to
make up these industrial organizations. I want to say that
neither in your time nor in mine will that change occur for lack
of timber for use. I would have said that off hand, perhaps,
because you will find in our country within the boundaries of the
State of Idaho, for instance, that there is enough timber at
least (they have estimated it time and time again) for the next
hundred years for every stick of that character in use, based on
the present consumption. And in all the Western States that kind
of a condition exists more or less. But I would have said this: I
would have gone further and I would have said that if it comes to
a time when we must change or depart from the wooden stull in the
mine to the metal, that that metal will not be made in or around
the mines, but it will be made in a shop somewhere, either
located in a central part of the mining industry or in a metal
workers&rsquo; shop or machine shop or something of that kind or
a foundry located distant from the mines. The fellows that handle
the iron may be not fall under the jurisdiction of the Western
Federation of Miners, except the fellow who places it in the
mine. Now, if that is true, we then believe there would not be
much trouble to find out where the industry started and where it
ceased as far as the mining industry were concerned, in the
matter of control over the man that works in and around the mine.
But I still won&rsquo;t take the position that I am not going to
take, and I do not want anybody to put me in the position of
saying to what each and every department of an industry they
shall or shall not belong, because I do not know where they
belong. If I had known, I would have tried to elaborate an entire
scheme, but I do not want to do that and I do not want you to do
it, because I believe we can only do that by the actual
experience that will come out of this organization.</p>
<p>Now, let me touch on another phase. How are we going to form
this organization? I want to say that with the possible exception
of two trade unions that are in this body to-day&mdash;and they
will have to be revised somewhat, in my opinion&mdash;there is
not a national or international organization in existence to-day
that can properly come into this organization. Now, where are we
going to get our organization? Why, my friends, we have simply
got to go out and educate these people that are working in these
already organized industries. We have got to organize them as
they come with us, believing in industrialism, into local
organizations, and it is going possibly to take us more than a
year, more than to the time of the coming of the next convention,
to even attempt to organize a national or an international
organization. Then why should we not wait? Why should we not go
into the field absolutely open, without a line of demarkation, in
order that we may go and find out just exactly where we shall
finally land in the makeup of this organization after another
year at least has passed by? There will not be a single union
come here, with the possible exception of the U. B. R. E. and the
Western Federation of Miners at the present time, except as they
come in as local organizations, and then are finally made up into
industrial organizations by the Executive Board of this
organization. That is, they will call them together and they will
organize and they will adjust themselves entirely as to who ought
and who ought not to belong to a certain industrial organization.
Now, take my own organization for instance, the organization that
I represent here. I want to tell you that if the amendment is
voted either way, if it is passed or no matter what is done at
this convention to organize a new movement, in order to get into
it the American Labor Union is absolutely
destroyed&mdash;absolutely. We cannot come in here as an
organization. We are made up of a great group of local
organizations, and they must come into this organization as
locals, and then finally be grouped into their national or
international organizations as they belong. There is not a
national organization to-day that can come into this organization
to which they can attach themselves, not a single, solitary one.
The national and international industrial unions that are finally
to make up this organization must be organized by this
organization itself, because they are not organized at the
present time. And then, my friends, there is a greater plea than
that for the amendment, that we ought simply to let ourselves
loose and to give ourselves absolute freedom to go among the
unemployed. I have heard one or two delegates here plead the
cause of the unemployed. I want to say that I want absolutely
every man and woman in the gutter and out of the gutter in this
organization. But we have got to organize them first and then
classify them in their various industries through the experience
and the knowledge of this organization itself. They are not
classified or organized at the present time.</p>
<p>Now, friends, in closing I want to refer to one of the most
important objections&mdash;or not really important, but I believe
one of the most weighty objections offered to the amendment, and
that was by Delegate De Leon. He said that my proposition was too
remote for the worker. I had estimated something like fifty years
to bring about the final ideal of this organization; and he said
that the wage worker would become discouraged, that I was setting
the time too far ahead. I want to say that I am firmly
convinced&mdash;and if I were not so I would not appear upon this
floor&mdash;that I am proposing the very thing to grasp the hand
of the worker to-morrow and give him encouragement in the battle
for his condition to-morrow, at the same time perhaps holding out
to him the final result a few years away. If we do not get these
people in, if we do not make a practical organization that will
take the wage system as it stands to-day and improve the
condition of the wage worker under the wage system, we will never
get the wage workers together to abolish the wage system. And I
do not want to see the abolition of the wage system before the
struggle of right now. I want a practical organization so that
to-morrow we can go out and say to these people. &ldquo; We are
here to help you battle under the wage system, while at the same
time we are battling for the abolition of the wage system.&rdquo;
I claim, my friends, that this kind of an organization will give
the greatest encouragement to the man who is a toiler in the
ranks of labor. I want to charge too remoteness against this
proposition; I want to say, friends, that this departmental
grouping is perhaps fully fifty years ahead of the industrial
time of today. This is too remote. This is too far a jump ahead
of the present education and the economic grouping of the working
class.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: May I ask a question?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes, when I finish. That is the charge against
this. And because of that nature, because of that grouping, the
organized laborer of to-day would not come into this
organization. I want to repeat the words that I said at the
beginning of this discussion. My friends, the adoption of the
form of organization either means the success or the defeat of
this movement, and I believe you too are here with an earnest,
honest, sincere purpose to make this organization a success. Too
remoteness is my greatest conception on this. If it is simply
made up for the purpose of representation on the Executive Board,
well and good; it may not have to be changed to any material
extent. But as a departmental grouping of the wage workers in one
great organization where a half dozen or a dozen different groups
of workmen are gathered together under one executive head, I say
that it is absolutely remote and the thing that will discourage
this movement and mean its defeat at its inception. And I want to
plead to you, delegates, along that line. I want you to throw
away all petty little differences that we may have had. I want
you to throw away all the prejudices that any of us may have. Let
us look at this organization from the standpoint of success. That
is what we are for. Let us make a practical organization that
will receive the almost instant support of hundreds of thousands
of the wage workers of this country; and if we do that it means
the glorious success of this organization; if we do not I believe
it simply means defeat at its birth and the setting back of this
very sentiment another five or another ten years in the United
States. I thank you most sincerely, indeed. (Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. JAMES O&rsquo;NEIL: Now will you answer my question?
Which trade will control me in that division? Shall the industry
I work in control me or shall the craft I work in control me?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I told you, Mr. O&rsquo;Neil, that every
individual industry would have to settle that proposition. I
don&rsquo;t want to settle it. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to settle
it because I am not big enough to settle it.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: Do you believe in the uniform transfer card
system that we have adopted in that constitution?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: You bet. That is what gives it effectiveness.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: If so, what are you going to do with the printer
in the packing house system? Is he compelled to take a transfer
card from the packing house industry to the printing
industry?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: You don&rsquo;t want me to answer that.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: I want you to.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, because the organizations will settle that
for themselves. That is, the Executive Board will settle that
proposition.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question occurs on the amendment. The
amendment is that this organization &ldquo;shall be composed of
national and international unions embracing all persons working
in an industry.&rdquo; Those in favor of the amendment will
signify it by saying aye&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Roll call on that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Contrary, no&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want a roll call.</p>
<p>Del. White: I rise to a point of information. Does the defeat
of this amendment prevent a motion to re-refer this proposition
to that committee?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, sir.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Will you entertain a motion before the roll call
to re-refer this whole proposition now back to the committee?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If the convention will permit the chair to
decide at this time whether or not this motion has been carried
or lost, such a motion would be considered.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I object to that. I want a roll call on this
amendment. However, I want to say this to the chair, that the
chair&rsquo;s position will not be correct if he takes the
position that a motion now to refer would be out of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will proceed with the roll call.</p>
<p>The roll call was proceeded with by the Secretary.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: While the Secretary is figuring this up I want to
say that of course there is a record or official report with each
name and how they vote. The Secretary has it in his
possession.</p>
<p>SECRETARY TRAUTMANN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: When it is published I don&rsquo;t want the total
record; I want the record of each individual voter.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: All right, that will be given out.</p>
<p>DEL. VEAL: Is there any possible way by which the number of
people represented by the independent vote here may be arrived
at? They were only seated as individuals, although there were
credentials here from several organizations. I would like to have
that vote brought out as far as the credentials show the
membership of the organizations. I know of one organization of
two thousand members that has voted on this proposition. I would
like to know if we can put that in such a way that it would go
out and show the people who are voting on this proposition, so as
to estimate the amount of membership they have in this
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. DILLON: Is it not out of order for us to do any such
thing officially? We might like to do it as a matter of
statistics, but is it not out of order to make such a motion?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: He has not made a motion. He simply asked if it
were possible to ascertain. I do not know how that can be done
except through the roll call and finding out those that do not
represent organizations.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The result is 39,540 1/2 no; 11,543 1/2 yes. The
amendment is lost. (Great applause).</p>
<p>[For detailed vote, see appendix.]</p>
<h4>HAYWOOD&rsquo;S MOTION TO REFER.</h4>
<p>Delegate Sherman was called to the chair.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: At this time I would ask the privilege of having
the motion to refer presented to the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: I again ask the privilege of seconding that
motion.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: I simply want to ask that the amendment be read
as the Secretary has it.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: The one you made yesterday?</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: Yes.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: &ldquo;That Section 2 of Article 1 be referred
back to the committee with instructions to specifically satisfy
and provide for that part of the Manifesto providing for craft
autonomy locally, industrial autonomy internationally, and
working class unity generally.&rdquo; That is the amendment to
the amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN (DELEGATE SHERMAN): You have heard read the
amendment. What is your pleasure? (Question called for). All in
favor of the amendment&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment; not
the spirit of the motion to refer, but its logical sequence in
this Article 1. It is not logically the part of Section 1 to deal
with that motion. Section 2, if the motion to refer it is
carried, is the place at which to consider it, namely: &ldquo;The
financial and industrial affairs of each Union,&rdquo; and so on,
&ldquo;shall be conducted by an Executive Board of not less than
seven nor more than twenty-one, selected and elected by the
general membership of said international union; provided that the
Executive Board and general membership of said international
industrial union shall at all times be subordinate to the General
Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the World, subject
to appeal, provided the expense of such referendum be borne by
the international industrial union or unions involved.&rdquo; It
seems to me that there is sufficient Power in that section to
regulate the industrial affairs of each department, each group of
industry, and that the discussion should come under that section.
This entire article is covering the form of organization. The
first section is simply the groupings. The second section deals
with the administration of those groupings, and it seems to me
that the motion ought to be referred to that part of the section
to be instantly discussed.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: Is an amendment to the motion in order?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This is an amendment that we have under
discussion at the present time.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: The motion is to refer. Is an amendment in
order?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I believe it is.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: If an amendment is in order, I move as an
amendment that Section 2, Article 1 of the constitution as
submitted the Committee on Constitution be amended as follows:
&ldquo;The Industrial Workers of the World shall consist of
organizations embracing all workers in a clearly defined,
distinct industry, which industrial organization shall be
subdivided according to the calling and location as seems
practicable to the membership thereof. It shall be the duty of
the General Executive Board to determine the jurisdiction line of
the industrial organization. An appeal may be taken from the
decision of the General Executive Board to a convention or to a
referendum vote of the membership of the general
organization.&rdquo; (Amendment seconded).</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair would rule that that amendment is out
of order.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I expected that decision, but I was then going to
point out this fact to you, under the proper rules of order: That
that motion would be perfectly in order, but the motion to refer
must take precedence. That is, we must vote on the motion to
refer, and then this would be in order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is the way I look at it. At this time it is
out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes, until we vote on this.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: As a member of the Committee on Constitution I ask
for the roll call on the amendment to refer.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: I take it that every member on the Constitution
Committee is on that committee and in this convention for the
purpose of carrying out the spirit of the Manifesto, the sense of
the Manifesto, the proposition or document that has resulted in
the bringing together of this convention: the document that has
created a world-wide discussion. This section as presented by the
Constitution Committee, in my opinion does not carry out the
sense of the Manifesto. When one of that committee takes the
floor and asserts that these divisions are groupings of
industries, he then is opposing the sense of the Manifesto. There
is a delegate on this floor representing 23,000 workers and they
occur in one of these groupings. He asserts that it is impossible
for his organization to become a part of this industrial union
unless it is so constructed that at least a portion of that
membership can be recognized as an industry.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: With the consent of the chair I would like to
submit a question. I would like to ask what delegate he refers to
as representing on the floor of this convention 23,000
workers.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: I refer to Delegate Critchlow of the
Laborers&rsquo; International Union. He is not voting 23,000
votes; he is here as a representative member of an organization
of that strength. There is a delegate on this floor representing
a number of thousand votes, that is not in accord with this
section; and there is the delegate now speaking. And as I have
asserted, it is because I believe that this section does not
carry into effect and into action the spirit of the Manifesto.
You have acknowledged on the floor that this is a grouping of
industries. The Western Federation of Miners, a delegate of which
I am, endorsed the Manifesto. It did not endorse a departmental
organization such as herein represented. I am opposed to the
general centralization of power (applause), only in so far as
that general centralization of administration affects the general
working class movement. (Applause). I believe that every industry
should have absolute control, jurisdiction, autonomy,
administration or whatever you may please to call it, over their
entire membership. And I believe that the local union and every
industrial union should accord to that local union jurisdiction
just as far as possible over all of their affairs. I do not
believe that there is a handful of men in this country that are
big enough to devise ways and means or point out methods and
tactics or ways of carrying on a tremendous organization. That
power must come from the rank and file. (Applause). It has been
asserted that this industrial union is for the purpose of
developing the individual membership to such an extent that they
will be able to say to the capitalist class that we understand
the workings of the economic industries and it won&rsquo;t be
very long until we will tell that class that we are getting ready
to move in. (Applause). I believe in an economic organization
that will so sufficiently organize the workers as to give them
control of the industries, and that is not going to be
accomplished by a general centralized administration. (Applause).
It can only be developed by giving to the individual just as much
individuality as you possibly can, so that he does note interfere
with the best interests of the members of his local. To give to
the locals administration over their affairs as long as they do
not interfere with the interests of the industries; and to give
the industries absolute jurisdiction and administrative autonomy
over the interests of the industries as long as they do not
interfere with the general working class movement; that, to my
mind, is a democratic method of administration. This, to my mind,
is a sort of Rooseveltian form of organization. This is a form of
organization where we give to the President of this organization
a power so that he can involve the industries represented in this
organization in strikes in any part of this country, and that is
what Roosevelt is doing. When he was down in Colorado he left
Taft sitting on the throne, and there wasn&rsquo;t any
trouble.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: Now, I want to take exception, as chairman of the
Committee on Constitution, to the speaker. He says that the
report of the Constitution Committee gives the power to the
President of the Industrial Workers of the World to involve every
industry in a strike. I say no. It places the power not in the
hands of the president, but in the hands of the General Executive
Board.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: Which is practically the same thing.
(Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I take exceptions to the speaker&rsquo;s position.
I claim that it is not the same thing. I claim that the Executive
Board of the organization that he represents has a voice in
conducting the affairs of that organization.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: And again I am compelled to assert that it is
practically the same thing, inasmuch as the president maps out
and has control of the workings of the Executive Board. To my
mind the president of this organization should be the smallest
potato in the row (applause), and if this constitution is adopted
in its entirety and this grouping of industries is formed that
they are going to work under, the president will be the biggest
fish in the puddle. But that is neither here nor there. That is a
matter that will directly adjust itself in a very short time. The
most important, the vital issue at this time, is to here and now
form an organization that can grow. I was in favor of the
amendment introduced by the delegate from Idaho, Delegate Coates,
but I am not in favor of it if he proposed by that amendment to
entirely wipe out this proposition. Now I am willing to have this
form of centralized government, provided that going down through
these segments, you will give to every industry that is grouped
there administration over their internal affairs; and it was
because the delegate&rsquo;s amendment did not provide for that,
that I voted against it. Now, as I have remarked before, there is
not one of the embers on this Constitution Committee that can
take exception to this amendment offered to refer, because what
we have asked is that they bring in a constitution in the spirit
of the Manifesto. If that is done you will launch an organization
here that is going to grow and grow rapidly; and in the course of
a few years it may be possible to bring this about. I trust that
it will never come to that stage, because I never want to see the
industries of this country centralized in a central general
administration. (Applause). You have got your general
administration at the present time under the capitalist system,
and it should not be your purpose here to try to emulate the
things that are being done by the capitalists. In speaking of
these groupings you say this takes identically the same form as
the industries of the capitalists. It is not so, positively not
so; because there is no capitalist corporation but what will
contend that every man in the railroad department must be a
railroader, that is, under the general supervision of men that
understand the railroad business. And that is so in every other
department. And while there is the same interest, the same money,
the same capital invested in the different industries, each
industry is operated by itself for the benefit of the capitalists
that have got their money invested there. This organization
should operate on those lines to the extent of saying that the
railroaders shall conduct their business, the miners shall
conduct their business, the printers shall conduct their
business, for the benefit of the working class, because we have
got our capital invested there. And that is carrying out the
sense, the spirit, the mandate, if you will, of this Manifesto. I
say mandate because I come instructed into this convention. The
convention of the Western Federation of Miners endorsed the
Manifesto. They did not endorse anything else. They endorsed all
other parts of the Manifesto, and not any particular part.
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, the motion to refer should not only
carry the support of our entire delegation, but I believe that
the truth, the facts that I have set forth here should bring to
that motion to refer the support of all the delegates on the
floor. I thank you. (Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I want to announce myself as being in favor of
referring this matter back to the committee, but in doing so I
should like to take issue with Delegate Haywood upon the
proposition he has suggested. I am not going to occupy a great
deal of your time. He said he is opposed to centralized
administration&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: No.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL (continuing): &mdash;for the reason that he
believes&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: Now, Delegate Hall, will you permit me to say
that I did not say anything of the kind? I said that I was
opposed to general centralized administration only in so far as
it affected the general working class movement.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: That is the same thing, except in different
language. I am willing to accept that. He agrees to centralize
administration, and he agrees to oppose centralized
administration. That is the statement in his words. I gave him
more credit than that, for simply saying that he opposed
centralized administration placed him on that side of the
question. I still maintain that he is opposed to centralized
administration. Now, I want to call your attention to
administration wherever it has been established in any part of
the world for any purpose. Would it be wise for a railway
corporation to divide its administration? I admit it is wise to
divide its legislative department. I admit that it is well to
bring in just as many people as possible to consult together upon
propositions of legislating, but when this legislation is
effected it is absolutely necessary to have the carrying out of
those propositions in the hands of one man. When you have it in
the hands of different men there is conflict, there is conflict
of authority. Conflict of authority always brings personal
conflict, which has been the weakness of the labor movement in
this country&mdash;absolutely its weakness. Now he says that
every industry should have autonomy. He means that in an
administrative way. I claim that if every industry is given
autonomy, that is directly opposed to the principles that are
necessary to be established in constructing an economic
organization. Now we will take the railway industry. To what
extent is he going to give that administration? If he gives that
administration to any extent whatever it means that he is taking
from the centralized administration that authority, and then
comes up the question as to how much they have not got? But the
point I want to call attention to is that it is establishing a
unity; a unity of authority, that is in opposition to the
centralized unit of authority that we should establish. But I
will not occupy your time. I simply want you to think of those
things yourselves. I want you to understand. Brother Haywood says
we should not emulate the capitalist class. I think we should
emulate the capitalist class in everything that has made them a
powerful factor, in everything that has put powers in their hands
to grind down the workingman. The same principles that have given
them power will give us power. He claims that they have
centralized their administration. They have done it for the
purpose of giving them power over the working class. Now, is it
not wise for us to emulate the capitalist when it comes to
principles of that kind that work for our interest? Brother
Haywood himself says that centralization of power&mdash;he has
told me privately that centralization of power is wise;
centralization not of power, but of administration. I think a
better term would be centralization of superintendence. That is a
term that suits me best. He says he is in favor of that, but that
our economic development at this time has not made it possible
for us to centralize our power because the working people are not
educated to that point. I claim that if that idea is correct, if
that general principle is correct, that we should announce it,
that we should establish it in our organization as a fundamental
principle. If we do not do that we are simply establishing
another organization that in a few years will have to be
destroyed in order to give place to an organization that more
nearly fits into the economic progress. We have the American
Labor Union, established six years ago. It has been presented to
the working people of the world. Practically the same element
that is forming this new economic organization is in the American
Labor Union. The A. L. U. has anything but the working class. If
it had it would have been a different organization to what it is
to-day. Now the idea suggested by Brother Haywood as his reason
for referring this back to the Committee is that he wants the
same proposition that we have got in the A. L. U. He does not
want to improve in the least upon what the A. L. U. was. I claim
that if we do not improve upon the A. L. U., that we will stand
in the world exactly as the A. L. U., and that is not what the
working people want. I am in favor of referring this back to the
Committee, but I would like and I want to leave them
uninstructed, but I would like for them to study these
propositions, not from the standpoint of their past experience in
the trade union movement not from the atmosphere that comes
through their own experience, but from a wise standpoint, judging
not from the failures of the past, but from the successes of the
past, which can be studied if we will study the capitalist plan
of organization. I am in favor of referring the report to the
Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I am opposed to that motion to refer this back to
the Committee for two reasons. In the first place it will retard
the work of this convention, and I think we have been here long
enough. The second reason is that I can judge by the disposition
of that Committee that the recommendation that they will give
when they do report will be practically or almost the same as
came from this Committee before, and that would raise the same
discussion as the first report has raised. That is why I am
opposed to referring it back to the Committee. We are here to do
business. If it is referred back to the Committee we will stay
here and wait for the report of that Committee, and it may be
another week before we have the report, and we will go over the
same ground that we did yesterday, practically the same
ground.</p>
<p>(Delegate Haywood resumed the chair.)</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I want to know whether we are working under a
suspension of the rules or those reported from the Committee.</p>
<p>CHAIRMAN: We are working under the rules of the Committee on
Rules of Order.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: I am opposed to referring this back to
the Constitution Committee, and I am not going to take up very
much of your time in telling you why I am opposed to it. In the
first place I want to say that in my opinion the report that this
Constitution Committee submitted to you is the result of their
best thought. If it is not acceptable to this convention, act
wisely and consign their report to the waste basket and appoint a
committee that will do your bidding and prepare a report that is
acceptable to you.</p>
<p>DEL. LUCY E. PARSONS: I believe the Committee have done the
best they could and did it conscientiously, and if the section
were referred to the same committee they would go over the same
ground and their report would cover practically the same ground.
For this reason I shall cast my vote no.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I feel that many of the delegates do not
thoroughly understand the intent of the Constitution Committee.
Several speakers who have addressed this convention on the
proposition have dwelt very strongly on the proposition that the
Executive Board would be an organization something the form that
a Czar would have. Now we will take the President; we provided
specifically there that the President was not a Czar; that if he
did anything detrimental to the movement in general, the General
Secretary or any of the Executive Board have the privilege of
preferring charges against him, and they have the power to
suspend or vacate his office. He is selected by a general vote of
the whole organization. Vice versa, when the Secretary is in the
same position; which practically puts it in the hands of the
people. Your Committee realized full well that the scope of any
of the departments was very large. Hence we felt that we had no
business to go into the departments in the Constitution further
than to provide for a minimum and a maximum initiation fee,
minimum and maximum dues, and place the per capita tax or general
tax at a universal figure for all organizations. We felt that
each department should enjoy a democratic government of their
own, and let the voice of the people say what form of government
they would give to their department. All we asked them to do was
to conform to the general Constitution. We proved, as we
believed, a wide scope for that Executive Board for the different
departments, from seven to twenty-one. Now, we did not say how
they would place those twenty-one, neither have we stated what
duties would be imposed upon those twenty-one if they saw fit to
elect twenty-one. But we supposed that they would take from the
spirit of the Manifesto and they would draw up a Constitution,
and they would no&plusmn; be appointive offices, but that they
would be elected by the whole membership of a department, and we
supposed that it would be made up of men who organized that
department and had some knowledge of the trade union movement and
the question that we are trying to solve here, which is the
solidarity of labor. We supposed that it would be made up of men
not wishing or desiring to divide the ranks within those
departments any further than it would be to divide the local
union by letting trades organize in local unions by themselves.
Your Committee as a unit believes that the blacksmiths should
have a blacksmith&rsquo;s union, for convenience sake, if not
more, for discussing grievances and not having other crafts there
to interfere with them on the floor, men that knew nothing about
it. Now then, if they got strong local unions in Department 13
representing Brother Coates&rsquo; craft, the printers, which has
been laid great stress on, there is nothing in this general
constitution that prohibits a representative at the head of those
local unions, as they would be printers; there is nothing that
prohibits them from having a sub-executive board behind them, and
each one of those that would be represented would be expected to
have an intelligent Executive Board in here that would be
composed of representative men of the different departments, of
the different local unions. There is nothing that prohibits
having local councils within themselves, or grievance committees,
as many as they want to. That is administration within
themselves; that is like a seat of government; it is a government
by themselves, within themselves. Then they come down here, and
Brother Coates lays great stress on the fact that nobody but a
printer can sit in this Executive Board and represent the
printers. Perhaps that might be so if he had no association here
where he would not hear any grievances on this Executive Board
where he is supposed to sit. That might be true, but he does at
all times preside at these meetings and he hears these grievances
come in, and perhaps after these a grievance comes in from the
printers, and there would be a grievance committee come before
this Executive Board of a hundred members, representing pressmen
and type-setters and the different departments among the
printers, and there it would be discussed; and I would hope that
they would never elect a man as their president there that would
not have intelligence enough to know how to instruct the
Secretary to take down the proceedings and take any manuscript
that they would furnish that would put them in a position to know
what the printers would want. Then the Constitution does not
debar this president, the representative, from taking any number
of witnesses before the Executive Board if there is any question
coming up there relative to any specific or special trade. I as
one of the committee am willing to serve this convention in any
capacity that the majority vote rules. I am your servant. While I
am on that committee I will serve you to the best of my ability;
but I will say that at the present time, from what I have heard
in the arguments that have been put forth, I tell you that if it
voted that we retire once more with this, I actually believe that
we will not be in a position to alter the proposition different
from the way it stands at the present time, but I am willing to
try. Brother Haywood is just as much in error as Brother Coates,
and Brother Haywood being an industrialist, would howl so that
the top of the Black Hills would go up to the sky if this thing
was put in working order the way he wants it within two years. I
contend that if the printers are entitled to an identification as
being a specific calling or trade, I claim the man that learns to
be an engineer, and gets a certificate before a board recognized
by a State, national and municipal government, certifying that he
is prepared to take under control that engine and machinery, that
the engineer is just as much entitled to a separate
representation and a separate national organization with a
separate national board, no matter whether that engineer works in
a mine or whether he works in a factory or whether he runs an
engine that runs a threshing machine in the rural districts. And
let the engineer or the blacksmith walk into the mining districts
where Brother Haywood has his industrial organization and begin
to dictate there and say that &ldquo;that man belongs to
me,&rdquo; and you will hear the boy put up his war whoop, you
bet, good and solid. Those things will come just as long as you
don&rsquo;t have the right form of organization. I thought we
were here to form an industrial organization, but it seems that
some have came here with the impression that it was industry
organizations. I am out of place if that is what this convention
was called for. I am in the wrong place, because I am first, last
and all the time opposed to forming industry organizations. I
cannot see where the sisters and brothers can take exception to
this Constitution. We have left it practically within the hands
of the people. We would naturally suppose that they would exhibit
the same spirit as here in drawing up their Constitution; that
they would have local control over their president and their
Executive Board; that they could take their representative out of
that Executive Board if they wanted to. We would suppose that
they had common sense enough to do that. I can not for the life
of me see that this division proposition means unification. It is
only a few months ago that I got up some statistics in the little
&ldquo;Metal Worker&rdquo; that bears my name as editor. I took
conservative figures and showed the thousands and hundreds of
thousands of dollars that are expended every year for Executive
Boards to keep men on salary serving the various organizations
that we have in existence now; and this would be identical; and
my only thought was to bring it down so that we could handle the
affairs and unite the sisters and brothers into one solid phalanx
so that they could realize that they were not following leaders,
but that there was a principle involved, and the only ones that
it was necessary to hire were those to carry on the actual local
business of the organization. It is a fact to-day that hundreds
of thousands of dollars are being paid by the poor unfortunate
working people, and some of them haven&rsquo;t got a bite in
their house, yet the salaries of those who represent them in the
organization must come every month. That is one thing I want to
be done away with. I want to see in this Constitution the
figure&mdash;heads, as I call them, the number of heads in the
organization, brought down smaller. Let the money remain with the
people; leave it in the country, leave it in the home, leave it
in the local district, and not pay anything out simply to keep a
lot of wise-looking guys, rubby-dubs I call them. While his
intent is all right, Brother Coates knows as well as I do the
disposition of human nature, and when you set up eighty or a
hundred governments those eighty or a hundred governments, no
matter what the ties may be in the federation, those governments
will conflict and their will quarrel.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Will the speaker answer a question?</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I will answer any question you wish to put.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Are you aware that the delegates were not sent
here to take up the time simply; they were sent here to do
work?</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: That is just what I was sent here for, and I am
not representing myself; I am representing my constituents, the
people that sent me here. I have no personal ax to grind; I am
representing the spirit of my people.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Your time is up. The question before the house
is that the section be referred to the Committee on
Constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. VEAL: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I am opposed to
referring this proposition Back to the Constitution Committee.
Why? It has been stated here that this chart does not come up to
the expectations of this convention. The men whom I represent
many of them, have laid on their pillows at night; they saw that
chart before they went to sleep; they saw it in the morning when
they woke up; it has become the property of the working class,
which has focused their minds on the class struggle proposition,
and they know where they are, in these large industries, based on
the class struggle. And because the printer and the scavenger
(applause) are placed together are we going to repudiate this
whole thing? This is what we want, as industrial unionist
revolutionists, to put these highly skilled
capitalist&mdash;trained men in the ranks with the slaves in the
ditch and in the mines, and say, &ldquo;You have got to come
here.&rdquo; A question has been raised about an arbitration
board and democracy. Yes, the American Federation of Labor has
said, &ldquo;Democracy.&rdquo; I would rather take two class
conscious workingmen to represent the economic interests of my
class than four million men who interpret it from a capitalist
point of view. What? Do you need to fear the men whom you are
going to select from this body of men? No; if we have reached the
point in American history and development whereby our class can
stand and without putting up any props to hold them in line, we
have reached that point where we can launch a class conscious
union. Then why do we need to cater to sentiment and cater to the
idea of democracy? (Applause). Here we are. We say, we claim in
defense of this chart that it does not exclude any one. And I
want to say that the representatives who have taken a position
against that proposition here, they themselves have sat from the
Atlantic to the Pacific on boards representing the various
crafts; and I claim as a representative of the working class that
I can interpret our class economic interests, whether of the
miner, engineer, or printer; and if we cannot interpret the fact
of the merchandise character of labor, if we cannot interpret
these various crafts under the head of the working class
movement, economically speaking, then we are in belief pure and
simplers, and we ought to go on record as being pure and simplers
and leave no record as being revolutionists. Hence I think this
thing has been discussed long enough. Let us adopt it. The spirit
that is behind it is a revolutionary spirit, and I would rather
take the spirit that is behind that than a perfect thing on paper
which is reactionary in its character. And with the experience
that we are going to get in the labor movement, in a year or two
years we can come to this convention with a proposition based on
experience without any so-called defects which seem to be
imaginary on this proposition. And after all, what does it mean?
It means the working class on the one hand and the capitalist
class on the other; and we can focus the minds of the slaves with
that thing better than anything&mdash;with this chart and with
the Manifesto better than anything that has ever been conceived
of in this century which will represent my class interests.</p>
<p>Question called for, at 12 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: In the opinion of the Chair all of the delegates
know whether they want to refer that or whether they want to
adopt the original. The Chair is willing to sit out ten minutes
if the rest of the delegates are willing.</p>
<p>DEL. KIRKPATRICK: I have never spoken.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. KIRKPATRICK: Mr. Chairman and Delegates, I believe that
the sentiment of the delegates in general is a unit. The only
thing that I see is a misunderstanding between different
opinions. But when you come to sum it up the same idea comes out
at the hub of the wheel. I believe that this convention ought to
take into consideration the autonomy that you set out in your
Manifesto; and the representatives, if you please, that have been
sent here as rubber-necks, as I call them, to find out the
sentiments of this convention, you will notice, are trade
autonomists, and if you hope to leave this convention with the
foundation of the Manifesto you must consider their case. I
believe in an industrial form of organization nationally, but not
locally. We must take into consideration the masses that are
organized at the present time and the condition that they are
organized in, and if you please, the experience that we have had
in the jurisdictional fights is what has brought us here to see
if we cannot eliminate that. We can eliminate it, and it shows in
this convention that it can be eliminated, because in local
localities there is no jurisdictional fight. That has been the
history of the American Federation of Labor, that it was the
fakir at the head that caused the jurisdictional fight, and not
the wage earners in the shop. Now, then, I ,want to state that I
am in favor of sending this back to the Constitution Committee,
not because of any reflection on the committee, because I believe
they did the best that they could; but I believe that in this
discussion that has been brought out they can see and grasp the
sentiment of the convention, and that they must in their
constitution recognize local autonomy; you must recognize that
fact. There is not a laborer but what wants to be classed in his
class. And you are telling us to be class conscious, and yet
there are some of the delegates that are looking too far ahead.
They have got the idea that when you tell them to be class
conscious they imagine it is to be class conscious with the men
they work with, whether it is in the ditch or in the machine
shop. He believes that he should support that man. If he is a
laborer he classes himself in that class. The delegates at the
present time are trying to convey the idea of a hundred years
from now. Ignorant men don&rsquo;t understand that, and you
cannot educate them to it at this particular time. Why should we
not take that wheel? I can conform to that wheel. I see within
that wheel that every organization represented in here can
conform to that wheel. The only conglomeration that I see in it
was the intent and hope to stipulate and name each and every
industrial organization. That was a foolish idea, to my
estimation, because I do not think the entire convention could do
it and put them in their place properly. But they will come. If
you will lay the foundation they will come each in its own
natural course. It will take some time, but you can bring it. I
would like to illustrate my ideas as best I know as a local
organizer in the metal industry. I would like to express my
opinion in that particular industry, because I work in that
industry. I see in one of the segments that you have a metal
industry. That meets with my approval in this way: that the
blacksmith and the machinist and the molder and the pattern
maker, the metal worker, etc., in the metal industry would not
lose their identity as a craft in that metal industry. They have
their local autonomy, but when it comes to a national issue there
is only one head. When there is any grievance that head decides
that if there are one or two or three of the different metal
crafts in that particular factory involved in a trouble they are
all involved. That is industrialism. It is not industries; you
are industrialists, in my estimation. Now, why can&rsquo;t we
agree? I do not believe that we need to have an international
president and an executive board for the molders, for the
machinists, for the metal workers and so on down the line till we
come to the entire metal industry. There is where we have use for
our trade autonomy from an international standpoint, and there is
where this trade autonomy proposition is fitting this industrial
form of organization at the present time, right from the
international standpoint. I believe that we could in that metal
industry make one office that all communications from the metal
industry would go direct to that office, and have only a
secretary and local representative who would need to do the
business of that one national organization. But when a grievance
went in there it would be going into the one office that
controlled that one metal industry, and only one.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Your time is up.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: Now, Mr. Chairman and Brothers, I do not wish
to take up your time by arguing on this question, but I do want
to take exception to the remarks made by some of the speakers who
preceded me. When I came here I came here with one idea, this one
thought foremost in my mind: I know that the workers of this
country want to be emancipated from wage slavery. That is what I
have been working for for years. I have realized this, that as
long as the workers of this country or of this world were divided
on trade lines and shop lines they never could be brought
together, or that they never could be brought to a state where
they would work as one. Now, I want to illustrate the
capitalistic system a little bit.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate, the convention cannot have its time
taken up by any further illustrations of the capitalist system.
The question before the house is the matter of referring this
proposition to the Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I want to speak on that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No further illustrations of the capitalist
system.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I want to speak on that, and I want to show
you the impracticability of sending this back to the committee,
before I get through; because we will get the same thing back
here again, in my opinion. I believe we should have one single
organization, organized with one single head; a practical working
machine, that would have absolute control over every working
industry in this country, and not only one. If we are going to do
anything we have got to have that. Now, then, in this committee
the different methods of organization were thrashed out, and the
committee brought a report in here with one dissenting vote, and
that was my own, against that system; and they decided then to
stay with it regardless of what came up in this convention. Now,
if you refer this back what do you expect to get from the
committee again? If you want something else, for God&rsquo;s sake
appoint a committee; for that one won&rsquo;t bring a report in
again that is any different, in my opinion. Now, I want to say
this much, that if we are going to have the old system of
organization, then let us all go into the American Federation of
Labor. If we won&rsquo;t form an industrial organization then let
us go into the American Labor Union where we belong, because I
want to say this, that the system that Delegate Coates has been
advocating here is not industrialism; it is industry, and if we
want to give the union craft organizations, then do so. That has
been my observation about the old American Labor Union, or
American Federation of Labor, that those jurisdictional fights
have always been schemes to divide the working class and keep it
divided. My object is to have one single organization and one
head for the business of directing the affairs of the working
class generally; and you know that the rank and file are at the
present time capable of running their own local affairs.</p>
<p>DEL. SCWHARTZ: After the discussion of the past two days I
have come to the conclusion as follows: that Delegate Coates is
in favor of this constitution, but objects to the wording. I do
not think the wording expresses what the interpretation of the
committee meant. That is what I understood Coates to say.
Therefore, I would make a motion that the interpretation of the
constitution by the committee be a part of the constitution, and
that will settle every question which has been discussed till
now.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Right here just let me ask a question. Whose
interpretation do you want?</p>
<p>DEL. SCHWARTZ: The interpretation from the Committee on
Constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: There are none of them that have interpreted it
alike, not one of them.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Every one has done it from a different
viewpoint.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHWARTZ: Yes, and I will do it differently. To which
interpretation do you refer when you state the interpretations
are not alike, may I ask?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: To the speeches of every delegate.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair will not entertain the motion, because
in the opinion of the Chair this convention does not want a
constitution that needs interpretation. We want one that we can
all understand.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: That is right. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Mr. Chairman, I take the floor, although I
consider every minute of this convention to be precious at this
late hour. I take it as a member of the Committee on
Constitution. I shall not go into any of the subjects that have
been debated here during the last two days. I believe I voice the
opinion of every member of that committee that they know they
have not produced a thing that is perfect. I believe I voice the
opinion of all when I say that they are convinced that if they
had a month to think this matter over, they would have produced
something better. I think I express their opinion when I say that
what they have produced has been the resultant of two
considerations&mdash;namely, the limited period we had to work
in, and the belief that by presenting this, we would present
something under which we can begin to work. I believe I express
the opinion of my fellow members on the committee when I say that
what they had in mind was to propose a temporary organization for
when this convention will have adjourned. For these reasons, I
shall not deny, indeed, I consider it very probable, that, if
this matter is referred back to our committee, we may now be able
to bring in something better. We may be able to do so for the
simple reason that we now know more. We are now bound to know
more because during the forty-eight hours that this discussion
has lasted we have grown forty-eight hours older. True enough, to
refer this matter back, to refer it back at this late hour, would
promote the designs of the A. F. of L. agencies, whoever and
wherever they may be, whose desire and designs must be to
protract the discussion so that this convention may adjourn
without having left even a nucleus of an organization. Even so, I
would not object to having this thing referred, lest the
committee be considered pig-headed. Nevertheless I shall vote
against the motion to refer for the reason that, tacked to the
motion to refer, there is a sentence which I, for one, cannot
understand. The closing sentence of the motion is that this
committee bring in a constitution in keeping with the Manifesto.
If this motion is carried it implies that the committee violated
the Manifesto. It is in the nature of things that a new term like
this of &ldquo;industrialism&rdquo; cannot yet have acquired such
a crystalized meaning as to convey the identical thought to all
minds. I believe that, at this stage, were you to take a hundred
men at random, you would with difficulty find any two who view
the subject from the identical side of its many sides; each would
be more likely to consider some one aspect of the subject, give
that aspect supreme importance, and frame his definition of
&ldquo;industrialism&rdquo; accordingly. When you refer this
thing back to the committee with that sentence and instruction
that we shall bring back a report in keeping with the
Manifesto&mdash;a thing that we believe we have done&mdash;you
simply set up to us a standard which I, for one, do not
understand. For that reason I shall vote against the motion to
refer. (Applause.)</p>
<p>(Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: I do not want to take up much of your time, and
I won&rsquo;t take up much of your time. I want to say this, that
the ideas that have been brought out here cover three general
stages of capitalist production. Delegate Coates brought in the
consummation of the pure and simple craft form. He would organize
perhaps into one union with reference to the industry in which
the printers were engaged, and as far as the other crafts were
concerned industrially he would not make anything specific and
definite. Delegate Haywood speaks of industrial autonomy. Now,
there can be no industrial autonomy in this organization any
further than it is a function, for the word
&ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; is not and should not be used, because it
expresses something that a particular industry has not got, a
function. It has an economic function, but it is not clear. It is
so closely interrelated and intermarried with other industries,
that have been organized before we have completely organized,
that when one part of this complete economic organization moves
all the rest of these parts must move. So these industries, any
of these industries, are subsidiary and supporting the whole
organization; and I hold that that chart as gotten up is
practically correct. In some of the details it might be
corrected. There might be some criticism about where some should
be. But the tendency of capitalist development is concentration.
We are going from industrial production to departmental
production. It won&rsquo;t be many years&mdash;in fact it is
practically now in embryo&mdash;till we have departmental
production. We have departmental production that takes in several
industries. The tendency in development in the early stages of
capital is to go into industries, and the later tendency is to
divide into departments, and these departments are international.
I am opposed to the amendment.</p>
<p>(Question called for.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is to refer Section 2 of Article 1 to
the Committee on Constitution. Those in favor of the motion will
signify it by saying aye. Contrary no.</p>
<p>(Roll call asked for.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: A delegate has requested a roll call before you
put the motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I do not hear any dissenting voice. The motion
is to refer.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I would ask that the motion be read. The motion
is not merely to refer, but with instruction that we bring back a
report in keeping with the Manifesto, which means that we have
not done that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will read the motion.</p>
<p>The Secretary read the motion, as follows: &ldquo;Motion to
refer back to the committee with instructions to specifically
satisfy and provide for that part of the Manifesto providing for
craft autonomy locally, industrial autonomy internationally, and
working class unity generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will call the roll.</p>
<p>The Secretary then called the roll of delegates and took the
vote. During the calling of the roll several delegates explained
their votes, as follows:</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I desire to explain my vote, as I believe I have
the privilege of doing in a convention of this character. I want
to say that I am in favor of referring this report of your
committee, that part of it, back to A committee. I am opposed to
referring it back to THE committee, as I understand is meant by
the amendment. I would vote in favor of having it referred back
to a committee, but I would vote against referring it back to the
original Constitution Committee. My vote is no.</p>
<p>DEL. KNIGHT: I have a right to explain my vote. I want to say
that I vote no for exactly the same reasons that Brother Moyer
gave.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I want to explain my vote. I do not believe
in sending this back to the same committee, because I know that
nothing else can come back from them. Therefore I vote no.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: I take the same position as Brother Moyer, but
I will vote yes.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I desire to say that I concur in everything
stated by Brother Moyer. I vote no.</p>
<p>DEL. VAIL: I believe that every member of the committee with
the exception of two voted for the constitution as amended. I was
the only member of my delegation on the committee and we vote as
a unit. I think it is useless to send that back to that
committee, and therefore I vote no for the entire delegation.</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: I understand that the next section
explains the very argument we are having here, and for that
reason I vote no. I am not one of the kind that lays down, and so
I vote no.</p>
<p>DEL. PARSONS: I believe the committee has done the best it
could, and has done it conscientiously. If we are to refer this
back to the same committee their report would go over practically
the same ground again. For that reason I cast my vote no.</p>
<p>(After the computation of the vote by the
Secretary&mdash;)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion to refer is lost; 20,759 no; 2,705
yes. (Applause). The motion to refer is lost. The convention
stands adjourned until ten minutes past one.</p>
<p>[For detailed vote on roll-call, see appendix.]</p>
<p>Adjourned at 12.10 P. M. till 1.10 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
