<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>THIRD DAY</h2>
<h3>Thursday, June 29</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>The convention was called to order at 9.20 A. M. by Chairman
Haywood.</p>
<p>The Secretary called the roll of delegates.</p>
<p>The minutes of the first day&rsquo;s session were read by the
Secretary, and there being no corrections, were declared
approved.</p>
<p>The minutes of the second day&rsquo;s session were then
read.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of the second
day&rsquo;s minutes. Are there any corrections?</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: The minutes as read do not show that the
motion with regard to the convention desiring a stenographic
report was adopted.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will note the correction. Are
there any other corrections? If not, the minutes will stand
approved as corrected. They are approved.</p>
<h4>COMMUNICATIONS.</h4>
<p>The Secretary read a number of communications from the
following bodies and places:</p>
<p class="indentb">L. A. 412, S. T. &amp; L. A. (Garment
Workers), New York City.</p>
<p class="indentb">N. A. Francis, Cincinnati.</p>
<p class="indentb">Emancipation Club, of Los Angeles, Cal.</p>
<p class="indentb">General Executive Board of Brotherhood of
Metal Workers of North America, New York.</p>
<p class="indentb">Amalgamated Metal Workers&rsquo; Union, New
York.</p>
<p class="indentb">Lawrence &amp; Co., photographer (two
communications), in reference to flash-light photographs of
delegates.</p>
<p>On motion the communications were received and placed on file.
The communications are as follows:</p>
<p>New York, June 28.</p>
<p>Mr. Wm. E. Trautmann,</p>
<p>Industrial Union Convention Hall,</p>
<p>Corner Clark and Erie Streets.</p>
<p>We beg to express our wishes that this convention will
accomplish the honest principles of new trade unionism based on
the class struggle.</p>

<p>Amalgamated Garment Workers&rsquo; Union of Greater New York,
L. A. 412, S. T. &amp; L. A.</p>
<p>Cincinnati, O., June 27, 1905.</p>
<p>Mr. W. E. Trautmann,</p>
<p>Cincinnati, O.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Your letter and bundle of Manifestoes at hand. I have
distributed a number of them and wherever they were shown they
inspired interest and enthusiasm. I am confident that from thirty
to fifty charter members can be organized in East Cincinnati at
an early date.</p>
<p>Please forward to my address as soon as convenient the
necessary application blanks together with full information as to
fees, about when an organization can be effected, etc.</p>
<p>Very truly yours,</p>
<p>N. A. FRANCIS.</p>
<p>JOINT EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF CHANDELIER, BRASS
AND METAL WORKERS OF NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>New York, June 20, 1905.</p>
<p>Executive Committee of the Industrial Organization of the
Workers,</p>
<p>Mr. Wm. E. Trautmann, Secretary,</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Wish to state that our Board coincides with the principle of
your movement but do not feel inclined to send delegates at this
early date to your convention.</p>
<p>Wishing you success and hoping to hear from you in the future,
I remain, yours respectfully,</p>
<p>C. BERTRAN, Secretary.</p>
<p>To Wm. E. Trautmann,</p>
<p>Dear Comrade</p>
<p>We, the undersigned special committee of the Emancipation Club
of Los Angeles, Cal., are hereby authorized to forward the
following communication to you, to be read in the convention, and
which will serve us instead of a delegate, as we are at present
unable to send one:</p>
<p>The Emancipation Club of Los Angeles is an organization formed
for the purpose of educating the working class along the lines of
purely revolutionary Socialism.</p>
<p>It has for its object the organization of the working class
into a proletarian, revolutionary body, both economic and
political, having as its sole purpose the complete overthrow of
the capitalist system of production and distribution, and the
establishment of the Socialist Republic.</p>
<p>From the vitals of such an organization would naturally spring
a purely proletarian, revolutionary, political body fully
equipped to carry the battle into the camp of the capitalist
enemy.</p>
<p>We hold that the existing craft unionism is hopelessly
dividing the working class on both the economic and political
fields, and constitutes itself, by virtue of its tactics, the
greatest obstacle to the unification of the workers.</p>
<p>Therefore we believe that the only hope for the working class,
is to unite them all into one collective union based upon the
clear lines of the uncompromising class struggle, having in every
way the immediate and future best interest of the whole working
class as its basic purpose.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that, consequent upon the present phase of
capitalist evolution, the time and conditions are fully ripe for
the organization of just such a union as we have thus briefly
outlined, and do sincerely hope that our comrades in convention
assembled, will be moved by the truly revolutionary spirit to
repudiate all the old and worthless forms of organization.</p>
<p>We hope that the structure which will then be projected into
being, will contain methods which will admit of such practical
benefits, as will infuse hope into the minds of the enslaved
toilers of America, and give them courage and assurance of
success in their final struggle for their permanent
emancipation.</p>
<p>Signed</p>
<p>CHAS. F. PURDY,</p>
<p>N. C. MADSEN, ANDREW M. JOSEPH.</p>
<p>June 27, 1905.</p>
<p>Mr. W. E. Trautman, Sec&rsquo;y.,</p>
<p>Industrial Union Convention,</p>
<p>Room 3 Haymarket Theatre Bldg., City.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>At the request of Mr. William D. Haywood, I am sending you
herewith a written proposal for making a large flashlight
interior photograph of the convention now being held.</p>
<p>Will you kindly read this to the members present to-morrow and
take the names of those promising to take a photograph and kindly
notify us?</p>
<p>We can arrange to make the photograph on Wednesday or
Thursday.</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance for this favor, we remain,</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>THE GEO. R. LAWRENCE CO., GEO. R. DUCE, Secretary.</p>
<p>June 27, 1905. To the Delegates of the Industrial Union
Convention.</p>
<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;We would be pleased to make a large size
photograph of the convention while in session. It will be made by
our patented flashlight process and we fully guarantee that a
perfect likeness will be made of every person in the room.</p>
<p>We shall make this photograph upon a guarantee of the sale of
2d copies at $2 each. Photographs will be suitably engraved and
will be a valuable souvenir of this initial convention.</p>
<p>Those who will promise to subscribe for one or more copies
will kindly give their names to Mr. W. E. Trautmann.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>THE GEO. R. LAWRENCE CO., GEO R. DUCE, Secretary.</p>
<h4>CREDENTIALS.</h4>
<p>The Committee on Credentials reported, recommending the
seating of the following delegates, with one vote each:</p>
<p>N. C. Marlatt, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Chicago ;
H. Arthur Morgan, Local 233, Cleveland, Ohio, Machinists; P.
Samuels, journeymen Tailors, No. 359, Chicago.</p>
<p>On motion of Delegate Dinger, the report was concurred in and
the delegates seated.</p>
<h4>DEBATE ON STENOGRAPHIC REPORT.</h4>
<p>Delegate Clarence Smith read the following report from the
special committee on ways and means to provide for a stenographic
report of the proceedings of the convention:</p>
<p>Chicago, June 28, 1905.</p>
<p>Your committee to provide ways and means for a stenographic
report recommends that each delegate in this convention who is
being paid for representation in this convention be assessed four
dollars to defray the expense of a stenographic report, and that
all other delegates be urged to contribute voluntarily as
liberally as they can afford.</p>
<p>(Signed by the Committee.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the report of the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. EVANS: I move to concur in the recommendation of the
committee. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that we
concur in the recommendation of the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: Does that mean that each S. T. &amp; L. A.
delegate shall be assessed $4 also? They have already contributed
$200 towards providing for the expense, and I do not think it is
necessary to impose $4 additional on each delegate here.</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: I think the convention is aware of the fact that
the committee that formulated those plans are heartily in favor
of having a stenographic report of this convention printed, and
in order to encourage the representatives from the S. T. &amp; L.
A. who started this movement by creating a $200 fund, we felt
that it was absolutely essential that we raise the money
immediately in order that they could feel assured of perfecting
and finishing the good work started by that organization. The
thought struck the committee that it might be an injustice to
place an additional assessment upon that delegation after they
had contributed the sum of $200, or an equivalent of $20 each for
the ten representatives to this convention, but before making any
provision on that matter we thought that it might be best to
leave that question to this convention to be settled. Personally
I feel that we should not again request those representatives to
contribute, as I feel that they have done their share towards the
completion of this work; but I do feel this way, that we should
have a stenographic report, and that it is absolutely necessary
to raise the money immediately. There are a large number of
representatives to this convention who represent themselves as
individuals, and they are not in a position to contribute the sum
of $4 towards completing this work, but delegates who represent
organizations can comply with this committee&rsquo;s request, and
if they do comply, I believe we will be able to go ahead and
complete a stenographic report of this convention, according to
the sense of the convention as adopted by the motion a few days
ago. Now, it is up to the convention to say, and it is up to the
representatives from the S. T. &amp; L. A. to state whether or
not they feel able to meet this assessment at this particular
time. If they do not, I am one who is in favor of excusing them
from contributing according to the report of that committee.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: It seems to me that the delegates from
the S. T. &amp; L. A. cannot properly ask to be excused from this
assessment. It is true that that organization has contributed
$200 toward this fund, but it is not true that the $200 is being
contributed by the delegates from the Socialist Trade and Labor
Alliance. It is very possible&mdash;in fact, I know it to be a
fact&mdash;that persons who are not connected with that
organization at all have contributed to that fund. I take it for
granted that each of the delegates from that organization has
contributed something. I however, do not know that any of the
delegates has contributed anything, and I therefore do not see
why the delegation should be excused from this assessment.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: It is not entirely clear to my mind what is
meant by the report of the committee. I do not believe that the
explanation made by a member of the committee has made it as
clear as it should be to the minds of those who are presumably
assessed. I want to say as an individual that I care very little
for the $4. I believe I am amply able to contribute. But the
report says those who are being paid to come to this convention
and I, perhaps, am being paid to come to this convention. My
mileage is paid, nothing else. The convention seats me as an
individual, of which I have no complaint to make, because it is
in accordance with the Manifesto issued; but yet in this report,
seating me as an individual, there seems to be an attempt made to
assess me as the representative of an organization that is not
represented in the convention. Mr. President, I wish to say
further that when this matter was debated yesterday the question
of expense came up, and there seemed to be a likelihood of the
question being defeated upon that question of expense. There
seemed to be also a probability of a stenographic report of the
proceedings of this convention being taken whether or not the
convention decided in favor of paying for that stenographic
report. (Applause.) A motion was passed, if I remember right,
that it be the sense of this convention; that a stenographic
report be taken, and the inference was that it would be taken
without expense to this convention. That was not stated plainly,
but it was an inference. Immediately after that a delegate made a
motion to appoint a committee on ways and means, for providing
the means for meeting the expense of this stenographic report.
Another delegate moved that upon that committee should be placed
only those delegates to this convention who favored the
stenographic report being made, and the Chairman, in endeavoring
to be fair, announced that none but such would be placed upon
that committee. Now, Mr. Chairman, I wish to repeat that in so
far as I am personally concerned, the $4 makes very little
difference to me, but I say, Mr. Chairman, openly and above
board, that if that was a piece of parliamentary trickery, that I
for one absolutely refuse to be assessed in that manner by this
convention.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Will you permit the Chair to express his
opinion?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That only the members of this convention who are
receiving per diem while in attendance will come under the head
of this assessment. Inasmuch as you have only received
transportation and are not being paid for your time at the
convention, you are not liable to this assessment.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I wish to correct a mistake, perhaps. While
present I am receiving a little per diem as the business agent of
the organization that I represent; nothing in connection with
this.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Charge him $4.</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: Mr. President and fellow delegates, I think I
understand this proposition. The Socialist Trade and Labor
Alliance has brought $200 here to help make up a fund for a
stenographic report. Now, then, my suggestion is this: it struck
me just a moment ago. In the event of a new organization being
formed at this convention, it strikes me it would be a pretty
good proposition to donate the $200 to guarantee the stenographer
his per diem, and after the report is transcribed at his own
expense the organization can stand per capita the expense. We
have the $200 on hand now, and after the organization comes into
existence it can assess its members per capita for the
balance.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegates are requested to confine their remarks
to the motion before the convention, that we concur in the
recommendation of the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: Well, I make that as an amendment to that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I did not catch your amendment. You did not make
any amendment while you had the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I will try to explain to him more distinctly
than Brother Smith, as to all those delegates who are here that
are paid. This delegate says he gets paid only as a
b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s agent. That means that he does not get paid $10 a
day for sitting here. Now, the committee has found it necessary
that all those delegates who are being paid here through an
organization shall pay an assessment of $4. If they cannot pay
from their b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s agent&rsquo;s salary they could ask
their organization to help them to pay the $4, if they like to do
so. All others who are here, are here because we know they, have
got a certain interest, and they should contribute as much as
possible voluntarily. In coming here, I am a poor man and live in
Denver in two little rooms, and I came here, and it costs me $200
in this convention, and I don&rsquo;t get paid as a
b-u-s-in-e-s-s agent. (Laughter and applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that we
concur in the recommendation of the committee. Those in favor of
the motion will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The Chair
is in doubt.</p>
<p>A roll call was asked for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I would ask for the uplifted right hand. Those
in favor will signify it by raising their right hands. The motion
is that the recommendation of the committee be concurred in.
Contrary by the same sign. The motion is lost.</p>
<p>DEL. W. L. HALL: I move you that the matter of finances be
again referred to the committee that has in charge the
stenographic report.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Louder.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If the delegates insist on holding private
conversations it would be useless for him to speak any louder. It
is impossible to conduct the business of the convention and at
the same time to carry on innumerable conversations around the
hall. Delegate Hall has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I move you that the matter of finances at present
under consideration be referred to the same committee that
reported, to bring in a different report from the one they have
just made to the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. ALBERT RYAN: What is the use of wasting the time of the
convention in this way?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There is no second to this motion. There is
nothing before the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. RYAN: I second it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the matter of financing the expense of a stenographic report be
referred back to the committee. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>DEL. RYAN: I would like to say, as a member of that committee
to which this matter was referred, that I do not believe it is
proper on the part of the convention at this time to refer it
back to the committee for them to make a still further
recommendation. The recommendation that they made was the best
one they could come to at that time. Now, then, it is up to you.
By a vote of something like 100 to 27 you decided that you
don&rsquo;t like to go down in your jeans according to our
recommendation. Therefore we think it better to leave it to the
convention right now and settle it one way or the other. I
don&rsquo;t see how your committee can go back and frame a
further recommendation. What that committee did was to the best
of their ability. You practically passed it up to them, and you
have their report.</p>
<p>DEL. SPIEGEL: I offer an amendment to the motion, that the
committee canvass personally the delegations for contributions,
and then if there is any lacking, assess these various groups
that we have represented here. I will head that list for the
Idaho State Federation with a contribution of $25. (Applause).
(Amendment seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I make a motion that the special committee on
this matter be discharged, and the entire matter referred to the
permanent Ways and Means Committee of this convention, and let
them bring in a proper plan. (Seconded).</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you offer that as an amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the amendment. Are you ready for
the question? (Question called for).</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Brother Chairman and Fellow Delegates all, by a
large majority yesterday we signified our willingness to assume a
certain money obligation. When we gave the assurance to the
stenographer here that a certain sum of money would be raised we
voluntarily placed ourselves in a position to assume the
obligation that the words implied. Now, here to-day, when our
committee brings in a report, we endeavor to saddle our own
personal money obligations off onto some one else. It is neither
fair nor just. The committee in their report made ample
provision, I presume, by which the money could be raised. Now,
instead of trying to carry out the committee&rsquo;s report and
raise that amount of money, we do like many people in all spheres
of life do&mdash;try to postpone the evil hour in which we are
called upon to raise this sum, and want to saddle our honest
debts off upon some one else at some future time. Are you not
ashamed of yourselves? I for one am ashamed to look an honest man
in the face, when I voluntarily assume an obligation and then try
to saddle it off onto some one else or to some future time. Let
us find out right here and now, while we have got the matter
before us, if there is some way to raise that money. Your
Permanent Ways and Means Committee, I do not doubt, will have a
report to offer.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is not a question of raising the money now.
The question before this convention is whether or not this matter
shall be referred to the permanent Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: That is all right. I will try to confine my
remarks strictly to that. Now, I do not wish to have this matter
referred back again. Being personally acquainted with one member
of that special Ways and Means Committee, I am satisfied that the
report that it will bring in again will be practically if not
identically the same. I refer to Delegate Smith. Now, there is no
reason in the world, in my opinion, for prolonging this matter
whatsoever. I hope the motion that is now before the house will
be voted down, and I for one shall vote against it.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I think the first motion that was made, to
refer it back to the same committee, is the best one. Inasmuch as
the recommendation of the committee was not adopted, the
committee might make a better effort to suit the majority when
they bring in a second report. I do not think there would be
anything wrong in sending out the committee a second time. It
very often happens that a judge will send out a jury a second
time to determine whether they shall hang a man or not. This is
not as serious a matter as that. But it seems to me that the
present bill that is to be paid, ought to be paid, perhaps, for a
little less than the $4 as recommended. Now, I represent the
carpenters&rsquo; organizations that I belong to as an
individual. They pay my expenses here and pay me my wages. Now, I
am not instructed to vote even to run that organization into
debt, but I know that that organization would never kick over as
small a matter as $4 for such a purpose. And I think the case is
likewise with other organizations that are represented here by
individuals.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY, CHICAGO: As a member of that committee, I
would like to call the attention of the convention to a
suggestion made in the meeting of the committee as a substitute,
that all the delegations here that have power to install their
unions assess their membership one cent. That would make $550,
and would settle the whole question.</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: I have no objection to the amendment to the motion,
but I would like to know if this committee, Brother Schatzke and
all, are going to be honorably or dishonorably discharged.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Honorably.</p>
<p>DEL. FRANK KREMER: Mr. Chairman, I gained credentials in this
convention because I am a revolutionist. I don&rsquo;t believe in
politics, and don&rsquo;t suppose that this convention is going
to be run by any faction, no matter what it may be, socialistic
or anarchistic, trades unionist or anything else. I want to state
the fact that I am here as an individual, and I am willing to pay
anything that may be decided on to help this movement, and if it
is required to pay one cent or ten dollars I am willing to do so.
Now, this ought to give me enough reasons to speak before a
convention of slaves, because slaves you are, all of you, no
matter what you are; if you are handling a pick or shoving a pen,
it don&rsquo;t make any difference.</p>
<p>Calls of order, and that the delegate was not speaking to the
motion.</p>
<p>DEL. KREMER: I am speaking to the motion, and the motion is
that we should pay $4, and I am willing to pay that and a good
many times more.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is not the question.</p>
<p>DEL. KREMER: It don&rsquo;t make any difference what it may
be. Mr. Chairman, if you will permit me&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just a moment.. If you will permit me to state,
the motion before the house at this time is the amendment offered
by Delegate Coates that this matter be referred to the standing
Ways and Means Committee. Now, confine your remarks to the
question at issue.</p>
<p>DEL. KREMER: Well, the standing Ways and Means Committee ought
to go to work and decide what a man ought to pay. If we have no
money, let us raise it; if we don&rsquo;t have the money, let us
raise it. If the standing Ways and Means Committee is to decide
whether we ought to pay $4, let us pay it. I am willing to do so,
and anybody else will be willing to pay the proper amount to make
this thing a success. If this thing is going to be run by some
political means, all right; I am willing to get out. I am not a
member of any political organization, and I don&rsquo;t want any
political organization to run it. And if the laborers gathering
in this hall&mdash;</p>
<p>Calls of &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. KREMER: Well, if you will tell me the reason why I should
sit down, I am willing to do so. I am willing to sit down if you
will tell me why I should sit down.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I rise to a point of order. The gentleman is not
speaking to the motion. He is speaking about his individual
intentions. We don&rsquo;t care about them.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chairman has requested that the delegate
confine himself to the question before the convention. The chair
will insist that you speak to the motion. The amendment is that
this matter be referred to the Ways and Means Committee. If you
are opposed to referring it, you will confine your remarks in
that direction. If in the affirmative, speak in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>DEL. KREMER: If that question is referred to the Committee on
Ways and Means, then I would like to ask that committee to
consider the matter very seriously, because there is not a cent
in the bunch as you are all gathered here; none of us has a
penny. You are all slaves. But when it comes to the point to
raise enough to make this convention a success, let us do it; let
us do it.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: That is good; that is all right.</p>
<p>DEL. KREMER: I mean to say this, if the Committee on Ways and
Means can tell us how to raise this fund to make this convention
a success, let us do it. That is all I have got to say, and I am
willing to say no more.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Good boy.</p>
<p>DEL. PAYMENT: Brothers, I think this question ought to be
referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, but I also think and
I know that there are delegates here that have not got the money;
but I know that there are some that have the money, and I know
that this money will be raised here. I myself, as an individual,
will give $10; not that I intend that the local that sent me here
shall pay that.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I rise to a point or order. The gentleman is not
speaking to the motion.</p>
<p>DEL. PAYMENT: I am.</p>
<p>The interrupting delegate: He is talking about his personal
finances. We want to get through with this business some
time.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question is whether or not this matter shall
be referred to the standing Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. PAYMENT: I was not here yesterday; I was working. I do
not doubt but what the Committee on Ways and Means that this body
has appointed is an honest committee. Let us leave it to the
Committee on Ways and Means, and then if somebody wants to donate
something let them have the privilege of doing so.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question has been called for.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: A point of information. I would like to ask if
this business be urgent and must be debated immediately.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We haven&rsquo;t got any bill yet. We
don&rsquo;t owe any one a cent. It is just a question of raising
the money to carry out the sense of the convention with regard to
having a stenographic report.</p>
<p>The previous question was called for.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I am in favor of the amendment as made by
Delegate Coates, that the committee be discharged and the matter
referred to the regular committee. I want to state my reasons. I
believe that every delegate here is heartily in accord with the
good and welfare of this movement, but I believe there are those
here who do not realize what this proposition means. I believe
that the committee that this should be referred to is a committee
who realize the responsibility of the work of this convention,
realizing the responsibility of the ways and means and what the
ways and means are to be used for and how it is to be paid, and I
believe they are better fitted to judge the ways and means in
which this fund should be raised or better fitted to make a
recommendation to this convention as to whether this report
should be got out or not. Many in this convention, I think;
believe that this assessment that has been offered here by this
committee would meet the expenditure of getting out this report
and printing it. I want to say to you, sisters and brothers, that
it would simply mean the expense of taking it off on the
typewriter, and in order to get it into printed form you will
have to make an assessment on somebody and raise from $2,500 to
$3,500. Before that is done the New York Daily People will
undoubtedly print the greatest part of it, and it will go into
history, and most of the people who are interested in it will
have read it, and consequently it will have become a dead issue.
For that reason I believe that we should stop and consider what
debt this means. This means only a part of the. debt that is
going to be raised. There are millions in this country that we
want to organize, and if we have got any money let us send the
agitator and the organizer among the rank and file that is not
organized and organize them, rather than print a report that will
not be read by anybody. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question has been called for. The amendment
is that the special committee be discharged and this matter be
referred to the standing Ways and Means Committee. Those in favor
will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The ayes seem to have
it.</p>
<p>Division called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is carried, the substitute. When the
convention adjourned&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SUNAGEL: I got here late. I would like to have a rising
vote on that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I can&rsquo;t understand a word you say.</p>
<p>DEL. SUNAGEL: I would like to know whether I have a right to
vote.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The subject has already been disposed of.</p>
<h4>APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEES</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: When the convention adjourned you had adopted
the report of your Committee on Rules of Order, which provides
that this day shall be set aside for the discussion of different
topics, providing that the appointments of the regular committees
had been made. In the opinion of the chair the convention should
at this time proceed to the election of the permanent committees,
so that as much of this day as has been set apart by your
Committee on Rules of Order can be used for the purpose
indicated. Therefore the several groups will announce their
appointments for committeemen on constitution. It will be
necessary for you to reduce it to writing and lay the same on the
Secretary&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: A point of information. There are a good many
delegates, I believe, who did not know anything about it, and it
takes time to think about those matters, and I believe that it
would be a good idea</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you ask for a point of information?</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is it that you desire?</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I would like to ask whether it would not be
better to have the convention now appoint a Constitution
Committee ; then a delegate will know what he has got to do, and
can come back with the idea of what he thinks is best to be in
the constitution.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I agree with you, yes. Now we want to get a
committee so that that committee will know something about it. I
think it would be well to permit the Secretary to call the roll
of the different organizations that are in groups, so that we can
get the positions of all&rsquo; their committeemen, and then I
will announce the different committeemen from the different
groups.</p>
<p>The roll was called as suggested by the Chairman, after which
the Chairman announced the composition of the following

<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is all of the standing committees as
provided for by your Committee on Rules. The chair would suggest
that there is one other very important committee that should be
appointed by this convention, and that is a Label and Emblem
Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. SPIEGEL: Being a member of the Committee on Rules, I make
a motion that we now appoint or let the chair appoint a committee
of five, known as a Label and Emblem Committee, limited to
five.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion could not be entertained by the chair
unless the convention reconsiders its action of yesterday wherein
it was provided that each one of the groups appoint a member on
each committee selected by this convention.</p>
<p>DEL. SPIEGEL: All right, I will withdraw that.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: I make a motion that this convention reconsider
its former action in selecting these committees by the various
groups and that the Chairman appoint a Committee on Label and
Emblem. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I would ask if the brother here voted in the
affirmative. Did you vote in the affirmative on the method of
appointing committees yesterday?</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is that we now reconsider this action
and that the chair appoint a Label and Emblem Committee. The
motion is to reconsider the action that you have taken on the
method of appointing committees. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>DEL. SAINER: I think it is best at the inception of this
movement to recognize the fact that to make this organization
practical depends upon the character of the members of the
organization. I think that following out this line, we ought to
vote down anything of that kind.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: As the mover of that motion, I favored
heartily the action taken yesterday in giving to the groups the
selection of the committees, as that was the proper course. But
now, after having done that, and this committee being of such
grave importance, and believing that the Chairman is one who has
had sufficient importance, and relying on his judgment in
selecting a committee of this kind, I think it would be wise now,
in order to save valuable time, that we reconsider that action
and place in the hands of the Chairman the appointment of that
Committee on Emblem and Label.</p>
<p>The question was called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded that we
reconsider the action of yesterday as to the method of appointing
committees. The question has been called for. Those in favor of
the motion will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion
is lost.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I move you that there be a special committee
of five on Label and Emblem appointed, and that that committee be
appointed by the chair. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: That was the same motion.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: No, the other was a special committee of
ten.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I move you that such a committee be added to the
regular list of committees, and that a list of the members be
handed to the Chairman, selected as the other committees of the
convention. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The several groups will take notice and appoint
their members on the Committee on Label and Emblem.</p>
<h4>DISCUSSION ON THE REASONS FOR THE MANIFESTO.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The business before the convention at this time,
inasmuch as the standing committees have been disposed of, is the
discussion as provided for by your Committee on Rules of Order
And Business. Your committee suggests that the following topics
be taken up: Reasons for the Manifesto; name of organization;
tactics and methods; the first of May as International Labor Day;
agreements vs. contracts; international relations. Reasons for
the Manifesto will be the first topic tinder discussion, and the
chair will not confine the delegates to the topics set forth in
the rules of order; that is to say, the convention will not be
closely confined to any particular topic during this
discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I understand I was appointed on a committee
from a group representing an organization that I do not belong
to. I want to know if any group having the power to appoint
committeemen have a right to go outside of their group and
appoint any one on any committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: They would not have a right to go outside of
their group and select any one for any committee.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I understand my name was placed on a committee
that has been appointed by representatives of an organization or
group that I do not belong to.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have no place on that committee. The
convention is now open for the discussion of the topics as
suggested.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: How much time is allowed? Is it only five
minutes?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Ten minutes is allowed to each speaker.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: A point of information. Did I understand you to
say that under this head no speaker would be confined to a
certain topic?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I said that no speaker would be confined closely
to the topic set forth. The reasons for the Manifesto cover a
broad field for discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: My idea is this, that we take up these various
phases that are to be discussed, seriatim, and thrash them out
one at a time. Otherwise we will find somebody jumping over onto
&ldquo;organization&rdquo; before we get through.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is the idea. Secretary Trautmann has the
floor.</p>
<h4>INDICTMENT AGAINST THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR.</h4>
<p>Address of W. E. TRAUTMANN.</p>
<p>Comrade Chairman and Delegates: When the general conference
was called, it was not so much owing to the form of organization
prior to that; it was not so much the methods of the past and the
inadequacy of the craft unionism of the American Federation of
Labor and the Knights of Labor. It was far more&mdash;the
conception of the corruption and the crimes that have been
perpetrated by capitalist henchmen in the ranks of labor against
the toilers of this land (applause) ; realizing this one fact,
that the old unions have been established to promote harmony
between the masters of the tools and those who toil to bring
profit to the few. Knowing very well that under that construction
of the trades and crafts union movement these crimes have been
perpetrated to perpetuate the system of capitalist robbery, we
came together and issued that Manifesto, well aware of the fact
that the toilers of this land do not know to the extent that they
ought to know the crimes that have been perpetrated in the last
fifteen years, and even more. All those who know the history of
the fight of the Knights of Labor and have seen the downfall of
that once great order; all those who have come into the American
Federation of Labor, believing that that organization after the
1886 convention at St. Louis would become an instrument of the
class struggle to bring about the emancipation of the working
class on the economic field, and have seen how that organization
has been debauched and corrupted by the labor leaders; all those
who realized that some other methods and some other forms had to
be established in order to open the eyes of the working
class,&mdash;came together and issued the Manifesto with the
indictment against the old form of organization. (Applause). It
was charged against the issuers of the Manifesto, in some
industrial union papers of Europe, as I can prove, that those who
issued the Manifesto could not prove that such a thing existed as
a collusion between the owners of the tools and the labor leaders
of this country. If you file information and charges, you have to
prove them, and before this convention we stand to-day ready to
prove most of the charges that to-day the trade union movement
has become an auxiliary to the capitalist class in order to hold
down the toilers of the land. (Applause). All that has been said,
all that has been charged against individuals in the trade union
movement is absolutely nonsensical if we do not go down to the
bottom from which these crimes arise. If you realize the harmony
between capital and labor; if you recognize such a thing to
exist, then you should not wonder that labor leaders become the
labor lieutenants of capitalism, in order, as Mark Hanna stated
in his address in Columbus three years ago, and which is in my
possession, that &ldquo;we must try to Americanize the trades
unions,&rdquo; and in order to accomplish that the labor
lieutenant of capitalism and the labor lieutenant of the captain
of industry must work hand in hand with the labor lieutenant of
the working class. I intended before I came to this convention to
compile from my own bitter experience in the trades union
movement, from the fights and quarrels and battles and
tribulations a synopsis so that it might go before the world and
prove from the trades union journals and from the documents of
the trades unions that they cannot act otherwise and be
consistent because they are and recognize that they are under the
management of the capitalist class. I bring such as I have
already got completed; I bring that in a concise and brief form,
with all the documents whereby from the trades union journals to
prove that such indictments were in order, and that the world
should know that not so much the forms, whether it be industrial
or craft unionism, not so much the process that we have seen
going on of accumulation of capital in the hands of the few and
the concentration of the workers in other lands has so much to do
with the coming revolution in the trade union movement, but the
fact that we have never, or those who are in the American
Federation of Labor have never recognized the fact that an
economic organization of the working class must be based upon the
recognition of the class conflict, and upon that recognition
alone will rest the guidance and emancipation of the workers and
the actions of those who are entrusted as its officers. If they
recognize those axioms and those laws, then their actions will be
governed thereby, and such things as Civic Federation banquets
with scab bread and scab cigars will never happen again among
those who are enlightened as to the causes of all these
debaucheries and all this corruption in the union movement of
this land.</p>
<p>In the arguments and indictments against the old form of labor
organization and its methods reference must be made to certain
persons intimately connected with the American Federation of
Labor. In so far as the nature of my task requires me to deal
with individuals I shall be guided by the rule which Karl Marx
lays down in the preface to his work on Capitalist Production, to
wit: &ldquo;Here individuals are dealt with only in so far as
they are personifications of economic categories, embodiments of
particular class-relations and class-interests.&rdquo; In this
view the harmful actions of officers of the American Federation
of Labor must be understood as the natural outcome of their
attitude toward the problems of capital and labor.</p>
<p>Since, then, most of the organizations chartered by the A. F.
of L. are based upon a presumed agreement of interests between
the capitalist class and the working class, the general trend of
their official administration is more or less consciously in the
direction of capitalist supremacy with all its evils and the
corruption which marks its sway.</p>
<p>You are gathered here to hear the proofs which warrant the
general indictment of craft unionism as set forth in the
Manifesto. With you rests the decision as to whether or not the
facts which I am about to relate are strong enough in number and
significance to justify the formation of a new organization
rooted in the class struggle and the adoption of new methods to
promote the interests of the working class.</p>
<p>In the days of the small manufacturer trades unions were able
to wrest from the owner of the tools certain rights and
concessions without, however, any protest against the basic
principles of profitmaking. Here and there, workingmen made
demands which invaded the inner sanctuary of exploitation and, as
a result of strikes and lockouts, the machinery of capitalism was
threatened with serious damage. Many of the far-seeing members of
the capitalist class perceived the importance of making the craft
unions serve the purposes of commerce by keeping them within the
bounds of capitalist economics. To accomplish this end it is
plain that the workers must be held in ignorance of the true
reasons which draw them together into unions. The very nature of
craft unionism made this end easy of achievement, and developed
unscrupulous men who performed the service for the capitalist
class of keeping the laboring class divided by trade
aristocracies and endless jurisdiction quarrels and by preaching,
in season and out of season, the doctrine of the community of
interests&mdash; between the workers and the shirkers.</p>
<p>Thus, in the official publication of the St. Louis, Mo.,
Exposition, 1904, of the American Federation of Labor Exhibit in
Social Economy Building, Samuel Gompers, president of the A. F.
of L., argues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not without reason that the members of this vast
federation have been inspired with confidence in the ability and
devotion of their officers, All of these latter are working
officers of the most successful national unions, and as such have
proved their capacity before being promoted to their present
positions. It should be remembered that it was the council of the
American Federation of Labor, acting in conjunction with the
chiefs of the railway brotherhoods, which refused to participate
in the great strike on the railroads centering in Chicago in
1894, and thus averted a bloody and disastrous conflict with the
military forces of the United States. It was this same council
that in refusing to affiliate with the Central Federation of New
York, with its fifty-nine local unions and some 18,ooo members,
because it included a branch of the Socialist Labor Party, struck
the key-note of resistance against the dangerous delusion that
the emancipation of the working class can be achieved by placing
in the hands of shallow politicians the business enterprises now
conducted by private persons. And it was the same council whose
policy after an envenomed conflict of five years&rsquo; duration,
was vindicated in open convention by a decisive vote of 1,796
against 274 and the programme of the common ownership of all the
means of production and distribution was declared alien to the
trade union movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here is the document (holding up printed report). And it
is the same story in the railway strike of 1894. So you men who
were in the battles then, you have it under the seal of the
American Federation of Labor, with the signature of Samuel
Gompers attached, that he was one of the lieutenants of
capitalism who broke the strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the systematic pursuit of a policy as above
illustrated, the American Federation of Labor has demonstrated to
the world that the spirit of the trade union is essentially
conservative, and that in the measure of its conservation it has
become the most valuable agent of social progress. This is a
truth only grasped by the most capable minds, and it is the
recognition of this truth, and its practical application in the
industrial world, that has enabled the American Federation of
Labor to transform the old-time trade union forces and tactics
into a disciplined army, only engaging in industrial war when
diplomacy has utterly failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this statement Mr. Gompers outlines what has been evidently
agreed upon between him and his colleagues in the National Civic
Federation: namely, that the craft union movement is to act as
the Praetorian Guard of the capitalist system. Indeed, the very
purpose of the National Civic Federation and the reason of its
existence is to use, and in the using to corrupt, the labor
movement to the lasting enslavement of the working class.</p>
<p>Out of the great mass of evidence which I have gathered to
show the practical operation of craft unionism along the lines of
capitalist exploitation I have selected first that pertaining to
the Cigar Makers&rsquo; International Union of America. Its
constitution establishes an aristocracy of labor and
discriminates against workingmen because of their race and the
poverty of their circumstances.</p>
<p>Section 64, page 17 of the tenth edition of the constitution,
provides that &ldquo;All persons engaged in the cigar industry,
except Chinese coolies and tenement-house workers, shall be
eligible to membership; this shall include manufacturers who
employ no journeymen cigar makers, and foremen who have less than
six members of the union working under them.&rdquo; It is further
specified that &ldquo;the acceptance of rollers and filler
breakers as members by initiation or by card shall be optional
with local unions, except in places where the system has already
been introduced.&rdquo; This section is manifestly designed to
foster a monopoly of a few craftsmen in collusion with a certain
class of manufacturers against outsiders. Section 154, page 39,
reveals additional evidence in the clause that &ldquo;no union
shall be allowed to furnish the labels for cigars made in whole
or in part by machinery.&rdquo; Thus the blue label of the Cigar
Makers&rsquo; International Union of America, instead of being a
mark of improved conditions for all workers in the cigar
industry, is merely the medium whereby a small proportion of
trades unionists, by mutual agreement with employers on the
selling price of cigars, preserve some rights which they refuse
to extend to those of their craft who work in shops where
machinery is used and to those whose employers cannot be forced
to sell their goods at the prices stipulated by the union. Yet in
spite of these restrictions and notwithstanding membership
discrimination against Chinese and tenement-house workers,
section 154 of the constitution provides that &ldquo;where the
manufacturer deals in Chinese, tenement-house or scab cigars, it
shall be optional with local unions to withhold the label from
such a firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stogie-makers and common workers in cigar factories and
employes of the Cigar Trust are absolutely debarred from the
union, and when they tried to organize under the American
Federation of Labor they were refused a charter because the Cigar
Makers&rsquo; International Union of America objected to its
issuance. (See Proceedings of A. F. of L. Convention, held in
Detroit, 1899). This is also true of the Tobacco Workers&rsquo;
International Union into whose membership no employes of the
Tobacco Trust may be admitted and whose regulations provide that
whenever an independent union factory becomes absorbed by the
trust the label shall be withdrawn and the employes either leave
the factory or the union.</p>
<p>That the Cigar Makers&rsquo; International Union of America
have the support of some manufacturers to the extent of the
latter&rsquo;s readiness to assist them in a strike against rival
manufacturers is borne out by a statement in the Cigar
Makers&rsquo; Official Journal, March, 1905, page 5, namely:
Daniel S. Jacobs, writing from New York, sums up the method for
fighting the trust through a strike of their employes and affirms
that &ldquo;the independent manufacturers would encourage the
strike in every way. They could be relied upon for every possible
support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cigar Makers&rsquo; Official Journal, December, 1903,
publishes without editorial protest a letter from a cigar maker
named David Goldstein in which the writer upholds the Boot and
Shoe Workers&rsquo; Union of Lynn, Mass., for scabbing on the
Knights of Labor cutters and avers that &ldquo;the vital
principle at stake, the maintenance of the contracts, of its
integrity, forced the Boot and Shoe Workers&rsquo; Union to
furnish men in the teeth of fierce opposition to fill the places
of the K. of L. cutters who had quit work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only is scabbing thus endorsed in the interests of the
sanctity of contract but it is also practised by the cigar makers
themselves. In the well-known case of the Resistencia of Tampa
and Key West, Florida, a militant working class organization, the
Cigar Makers&rsquo; International Union of America, assisted the
manufacturers to crush out of existence this admirably class
conscious union.</p>
<p>Another organization which is even more notably in collusion
with the employers than the Cigar Makers&rsquo; International
Union of America is the United Garment Workers of America. In
1903 the Association of Manufacturers of Workingmen&rsquo;s
Garments met in Chicago to confer with officials of the United
Garment Workers concerning the regulation of the prices of
garments and the use of the union label. Agreements were made
between the two contracting parties by which the union became the
facile tool of the employers. On January 26th and 27th, 1904, the
Association met again in New York. According to the Weekly
Bulletin of the Clothing Trades, February 5, official organ of
the United Garment Workers of America, &ldquo;the chairman was
Mr. H. S. Peters, a member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers and Firemen, and a manufacturer . It was voted by each
firm to subscribe a liberal sum to the fund of the national union
for advertising the union label and to assist the union in
improving the quality of the goods bearing the label. One of the
principal objects of the Association is to remedy selling abuses
that create an injurious competition and the effects of which are
to depress wages and make difficult an increase . Walter
Charriere, president of the Shirt, Waist and Laundry Workers,
spoke on the label of his union. He said that his union wanted
the shirt, waist and laundry workers&rsquo; label to be placed on
both working and dress shirts. He also stated that he had
attended the convention for the purpose of trying to assist the
manufacturers in preventing competition between those
manufacturers using his label and the label of the U. G. W. of A.
General Secretary White replied that his organization objected to
a divided jurisdiction in one shop.&rdquo; The convention then
passed a resolution favoring the United Garment Workers of
America as against the other union because its plans were ordered
with a view to using the United Garment Workers for its own
aggrandizement.</p>
<p>This jurisdiction fight occurred in Chicago, you will
remember, when the so-called Independent Clothing Makers caused a
lockout and the members of our class were clubbed on the street
in battling with the police and lieutenants of the capitalist
class, without knowing that they were hoodwinked.</p>
<p>At the annual convention of the Association of Overall
Manufacturers using the union label held in New York, January,
1904, the general officers of the United Garment Workers were
invited to participate in the work of the convention, and,
according to the Weekly Bulletin of the Clothing Trades, the
general secretary attended and delivered an address. A Baltimore
manufacturer, Mr. Moses Morris, is quoted by the Bulletin as
saying in the course of his address to the convention:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a talk with Henry White, of the Garment Workers,
in which he agreed with me that an organization of the
manufacturers using the label could be made of great benefit to
his organization as well, and that by concerted action a great
many evils might be remedied, or at least lessened, and new evils
prevented to a great degree . . . After all is said and done,
none of us is more or less than a labor organizer himself, in the
large sense, and I am proud of being able to term myself an
organizer of labor, and I sincerely hope that those whom I have
organized, with a view of producing certain articles economically
and good, realize that in being one of their head workers I
assume a great deal of responsibility that some labor organizers
do not seem to realize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You find in one industry in the American Federation of Labor
the organization has made a contract with the manufacturers for
the use of the label on scab goods because the representative of
the manufacturers was a personal friend of the executive head of
the organization.</p>
<p>That this combination of worker and shirker is carried on in
the interest of the latter is amply proved by the fact that the
union label is used as an advertising agency for the
manufacturer. Thus, according to the Bulletin of April 15,
1904:</p>
<p>&ldquo;W. H. Scott, advertising manager of Sweet, Orr &amp;
Co., has organized a Union Label Advertising League, his mode of
advertising being by public demonstrations in conjunction with
those retail merchants who sell union made products. Exhibitions
of labels and other union symbols are given in halls or theatres,
and to this method is added street parades on a grand scale, with
unique features.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The union label, it will be observed, is practically the
manufacturers&rsquo; label. In the account of the 1905 convention
of the Union Made Garment Manufacturers of America the Weekly
Bulletin of the Clothing Trades, under the title of Perfect
Harmony with &ldquo;Union Made&rdquo; Firms, reports that
&ldquo;a uniform national scale for the overall trade is to be
considered by a special committee and a committee of the union
prior to the union&rsquo;s convention. To cap the climax the
manufacturers selected as their secretary and labor commissioner
Walter Chuck, the well-known General Executive Board member of
our international union.&rdquo; And in rebuttal of a charge made
by the Daily Trade Record the Bulletin avers that &ldquo;the only
hostility shown is toward those employers, label or non-label,
who refuse to come up to the standards demanded equally and
invariably of all manufacturers.&rdquo; These standards you will
perceive from what I have already said are measured by the
selling price agreements of the union manufacturers.</p>
<p>The same &ldquo;harmony of interests&rdquo; conspiracy exists
between the International Boot and Shoe Workers and the shoe
manufacturers as evidenced in the business transactions of the
international officers of that union in the last four years.
Their official journal openly admits that the label should be
issued to manufacturers at the discretion of the national
officers, and that &ldquo;the shoe worker must come to the
realization of the fact that owing to existing conditions the
majority of the manufacturers do not derive anywhere near as
large a profit from their business as the manufacturers in other
directions . . . The opponents of the present policy of the Boot
and Shoe Workers&rsquo; Union claim that wages should be
increased before the union stamp is issued. At the present time
there is about as much sense in this as there would be in a shoe
worker with a sturdy pair of legs buying crutches to navigate on,
or taking a dose of Paris green for an invigorator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the February, 1905, edition of the Boot and Shoe
Workers&rsquo; Journal the following argument is made in favor of
the manufacturer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sentiment of the meeting of the manufacturers was
that an advance in the selling price of shoes was absolutely
necessary, not only in the welfare of the shoe manufacturers, but
also the jobber and retailer. To this should be added the shoe
workers. Unless the manufacturers get together and formulate some
practical agreement or plan fixing a fair price for their product
a large number of them must continue to operate their factories
at a little above the expense of carrying on the
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that a more or less formal agreement
exists between the manufacturers and the union officials for the
purpose of limiting the number of those manufacturers who may use
the union stamp so that, with the aid of the union officials, any
increased demand for union made shoes may redound to the profit
of the manufacturers in the combination rather than to the
enlargement of wages for the boot and shoe workers.</p>
<p>It is not overstepping the bounds of truth to say that,
whatever crimes have been perpetrated against the workers by
agents of the capitalist class in the ranks of labor, none is
more atrocious than those committed by international officers of
the Boot and Shoe Workers, notably by Tobin, their general
president and a member of the Civic Federation; Eaton, their
former secretary, Skeffington and Gordon&mdash;vampires all who
fatten upon the life-blood of the toilers.</p>
<p>Now I will recall a case from memory because I have not the
documents here. There is present at this convention as one of the
delegates a man who was a victim in this case. Here comes the
General Secretary of the Boot and Shoe Workers&rsquo; Union,
offering the Hamilton-Brown factory to operate one of their
non-union factories with union men, to show the manager of that
firm after a certain lapse of time that shoes can be manufactured
cheaper in union than in non-union factories, and the result
showed that the cost under the agreement with the Boot and Shoe
Workers&rsquo; organization, the wages of the slaves in the union
factories, were less than where you have no organization.
(Applause). And here are men in St. Louis thrown out on the
street because, as letters in my possession from the Boot and
Shoe Workers&rsquo; Union will prove, the officers insisted that
the boot and shoe workers be not organized in St. Louis; and when
the men in the factories insisted that they had a right to come
together, and when they were forced to go on the street, it was
the same Boot and Shoe Workers&rsquo; Union that filled the
places of the men and crushed the spirit of those people.</p>
<p>If I had time to compile the facts I could show many instances
where the organizations have been used as the instruments of the
capitalist class against the interests of the toilers.</p>
<p>Now as to the indictment against the high initiation fee. Here
comes over to this country a Bohemian by the name of Richard
Czarniak, belonging for eleven years to the industrial unions of
Germany, Switzerland, Bohemia, France, and Denmark, and
everywhere recognized with his card as a glass blower. He comes
upon the shores of this country, and being imbued with the class
solidarity of the toilers and believing that the doors of the
unions would be open to him, he applies for a job in a factory in
New Jersey. The manufacturer tells him he can give him work, but
before he can give him work he will have to apply for admission
in the Green Bottle Blowers&rsquo; Union. He makes application
for admission to an organization belonging to the American
Federation of Labor, and the Vice President of the Federation
sends a reply, and the letters are on file, that unless he pays
down $500 as an initiation fee he will not be allowed to work,
and that man has been made a scab because he could not get work
under the union.</p>
<p>You go to the City of New York and you find unions charging
$100 initiation fee, and you find also a press censorship against
those who rebel against this condition of things. You find the
National Civic Federation fostering this condition through the
trade journals in the last few years, and through the trade
unions of this land, including the machinists&rsquo; journals,
annexed to the so-called literary education club of the Civic
Federation, and dictating what should be admitted into the labor
journals and what should be rejected.. A press censorship has
been established in this country, not by the capitalist class,
but by the lieutenants of the capitalist class in the labor
ranks. (Loud applause). And when you realize that the Green
Bottle Blowers&rsquo; organization could not exist except by the
permission of the capitalists; when you realize the fact that the
Annheuser Busch Brewing Company of St. Louis, was the first one
that organized the Green Bottle Blowers in the belief that it
would be a club which the American Federation of Labor could hold
over the heads of other manufacturers of beer in this country by
creating a monopoly through a $500 initiation fee; when you
realize that the same Green Bottle Blowers&rsquo; organization is
fighting against all inventions and fighting them if possible out
of existence so as to uphold its monopoly of a $500 initiation
fee, then you will see that it is you workers that are interested
in the destruction of this condition.</p>
<p>I have letters from engineers and firemen who were driven out
of their country over the sea, who were union men all their lives
from the time they were eighteen years of age, and who tried to
get positions in New York City with a good-standing card from the
Socialist Labor Party of Bohemia, with a good-standing card in
the union for twelve years, and on account of so-called
restrictions in the license laws these same good revolutionary
union men were denied the right to work in union factories. There
are delegates on the floor of this convention that know these
facts.</p>
<p>It was the realization of these facts, the realization of the
many crimes perpetrated, a realization of facts that my own
bitter experience can prove; when we see men and women of our
class standing. in line fighting injunctions and detectives, and
the labor leaders saying: &ldquo;We will fill your places if you
don&rsquo;t go back to work&rdquo;; and when we see them
compelled to submit by the mandate of Samuel Gompers and the
mandate of the American Federation of Labor, and forced to go
back to work and lose their strike;&mdash;it is the realization
of these facts that has forced men to become the enemies of the
craft union movement. (Applause.)</p>
<p>In the Western Federation of Miners, it can be proved by
uncontroverted evidence, that by collusion between Mr. Gompers
and the Executive Board of the American Federation of Labor prior
to the Cripple Creek disaster, it was decided to crush that
Western Federation organization out of existence because it would
not submit to the mandates of the Executive Council of the
American Federation of Labor. (Applause). It can be proved that
letters were sent to unions three years ago to withdraw support
from the Western Federation of Miners. It can be proved that
after the mine disaster in Independence Mr. Easley, of the Civic
Federation, on behalf of the American Federation of Labor
Executive Board, sent a telegram to Peabody, Governor of
Colorado, ordering that no discrimination should be made against
members of the American Federation of Labor. It is on record that
Governor Peabody said, &ldquo;We have no objection against
organizations working in harmony with the capitalist
class.&rdquo; (Applause). They have no objections because they
are practically auxiliaries of the capitalist class. But they
must fight these revolutionary unions which stand and fight for
something better for the working class; who believe not, as
Mitchell believes, that the toiler should practically give up
hope of ever bettering his present conditions, but which rather
foster the idea that our mission is to free the working class
from the bondage of wage slavery and do away with the henchmen of
the capitalist class who are acting as the labor lieutenants of
this land.</p>
<p>We have the evidence to back up, as this evidence has been
collected, that every crime charged in the last five years can be
proved. Here in the teamsters&rsquo; strike in Chicago a year
prior, Mr. Shaw went to Chicago and threatened the common brewery
workers that they would fill the places of the brewery workers if
they should insist on demanding one dollar more wages. The threat
was made in black and white that they would fill the places of
the union men, and by that means the breweries were saved
$850,000.</p>
<p>It is this indictment of the pure and simple craft union
movement that has brought the men and women together to fight for
a better organization, to struggle for a better economic
organization that will, in conjunction with all that makes for
progress, bring us to the desired goal where the workers will be
free. (Prolonged applause.)</p>
<p>During the delivery of Secretary&rsquo;s indictment, on motion
of Delegate A. M. Simons, the speaker was granted unlimited time
to complete his remarks.</p>
<p>During the address, also, Mother Jones was called to the
chair, and presided during the remainder of the morning
session.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the address the convention adjourned
until one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
