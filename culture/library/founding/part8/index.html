<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>FIFTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Saturday, July 1</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>Chairman Haywood called the convention to order at nine
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>On motion the calling of the roll of delegates was dispensed
with.</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann read the minutes of the previous session,
and there being no corrections, the minutes were declared
approved as read.</p>
<h4>COMMUNICATION</h4>
<p>The Secretary read the following telegram from Cleveland,
Ohio, and it was ordered placed on file.</p>
<p>Cleveland, Ohio, June 30.</p>
<p>Industrial Union Convention, Brand&rsquo;s Hall, cor. Clark
and Erie streets, Chicago.</p>
<p>Fraternal greetings. May the proceedings of your convention
realize the hopes of all class-conscious workingmen.</p>
<p>SOCIALISTISCHE ARBEITER ZEITUNG,</p>
<p>German Organ of Socialist Labor Party.</p>
<h4>REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN, OF THE COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTION: I am not
prepared to say when we can make a report. We may be engaged
during the entire day.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: The members of the Constitution Committee have
learned that Comrade Powers, of the S. T. &amp; L. A., had to go
to his room sick yesterday afternoon, and has since been unable
to leave. I have consulted the S. T. &amp; L. A. delegates as to
whom we should put on the Constitution Committee in his place,
and I have asked the members of the delegation if Comrade De Leon
would not be the best one to put on in Delegate Powers&rsquo;s
place, and they have agreed that he be substituted for Delegate
Powers on the Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That being the case, Comrade De Leon will be
appointed a member of the Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: Mr. Chairman, while I understand that there should
be twenty-one members on that committee, we have been unable to
muster but thirteen. At the present time the Constitution
Committee should be filled, and I have a communication here from
delegates to the convention that I should like to have read. The
Secretary read the following communication from the International
Musicians&rsquo; Union, Chicago:</p>
<p>Chicago, June 30, 1905. Committee on Constitution, Industrial
Convention</p>
<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;While individual delegates, locals
representing twenty or thirty members, national organizations
with no power to install their bodies in a new industrial
organization are seated in your Committee, yet our International
Organization, one of the signers of the Manifesto, whose locals
all contributed financially to the expense of the Convention,
whose representatives are on the floor of the Convention with
full power to install their International in the movement, who
are the only representatives of one of the great industrial
departments, that of the Public Service, has, through a
technicality been denied that privilege as an international
organization, whose intention is to become a part of the coming
Industrial Union, we are particularly interested in the
Constitution; as representatives of the Public Service Industry
we feel we are more competent to represent our industry, and
calling in particular, than others; and while we are amply able
to make our objections to your report, if any, on the floor of
the Convention, yet we feel that it puts, not alone our
International, but the Industrial Movement in a bad light, to
debar representatives of a recognized organized International
Union a right, on the Constitution that is to govern them, unless
perhaps, you have men already on the Committee who feel they
understand our calling, and the industry of which we are to
become a part, better than those who engaged in it, and who have
helped to build up a branch into an international body in face of
the most violent opposition of the A. F. of L. If such is the
case, we are satisfied, but if not, I ask that our International
be given representation on your Committee unofficial if
necessary, but with full right to the floor in matters pertaining
to our calling and the Industry in which we will be placed.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
<p>W. SHURTLEFF</p>
<p>Gen&rsquo;l Sec&rsquo;y, International Union.</p>
<p>(Referred to Convention.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Has the Constitution Committee any
recommendation to make in regard to this communication that was
handed to them?</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: I will say on behalf of the Constitution Committee
that that communication was presented to our committee and we
discussed it for some time, and we felt that we had no authority
to increase that committee, as the convention had already
provided for the number of that committee, and it was our duty to
refer that question back to the convention for consideration. As
a member of the committee I feel that the rules should be
suspended and this delegate be permitted to sit with the
Constitution Committee. I feel that way for this one significant
fact: That this brother has probably some ideas about the laws
protecting his organization that he wishes incorporated in the
constitution. If we do not give him an opportunity of voicing his
sentiments before the Constitution Committee, it is probable that
when the committee reports to this convention valuable time will
be taken up here in discussing something that would probably be
disposed of in much less till before the proper committee, and in
order to save the time of the convention, which is becoming
seriously valuable, I believe that that delegate should be given
permission to act with the Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the International Union of
Musicians be permitted to select their representative on the
Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded that the
International Union of Musicians select their representative on
the Constitution Committee. You have heard the motion. Are you
ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: Do I understand that this brother who made the
report comes from a bona fide organization with credentials and
empowered to act?</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: The Musical Union of Chicago, with 165 members
send credentials here with power to install that
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I have no doubt in my mind that the
Musicians&rsquo; Union will select a member of the committee from
the body.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: These in favor of the motion will signify by
saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried. The International
Musical Union will select their member of the Constitution
Committee. I will say to the Constitution Committee that if
thirteen members have been meeting with that committee it has all
the delegates that have been selected up to the present time. I
think you have a full committee.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTIONS</h4>
<p>DEL. COATES OF THE RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE: Mr. Chairman and
Delegates, the Resolutions Committee is able to report on all
resolutions that have been submitted to it. If there is no
objection I will read the original resolution and then the
substitute.</p>
<p>There being no objection, Del. Coates read Resolution No. 4,
heretofore printed, offered by Delegate Klemensic.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: The Committee on Resolutions offers the following
substitute and ask that the convention adopt it:</p>
<p>Resolved, That the first day of May of each year, which day
has been selected as the International Labor Day, by the
International Congress of Labor, be designated as the Labor Day
of this organization, and that the members of this organization
be urged to cease all labor on that day and carry out exercises
appropriate to such a day for the education of the working class
as to their rights and interests on the economic and political
fields.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the report of your Committee on
Resolutions relative to the first of May as International Labor
Day. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I move that the recommendation of the
Resolutions Committee be concurred in. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the recommendation of the committee be concurred in.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: Since 1881 I have taken more or less interest
in organization work. As organized labor we have tried the first
of May as a labor holiday. We tried it for years, and we found
that it was not successful. In my estimation, as far as this
organization is concerned, it would not make any difference what
day in the year you have for a labor holiday. Now, if it should
be the case that we did not care, let us take advantage of all
the good work that has already been done. There is no one here
that can deny that a good piece of work has been already done by
having established a labor is day in this country, all over the
country. That in itself is recognizing the proletariat. We tried
the first of May, and we found some difficulties in the way of
that day. We found that it was at a period of the year when we
were likely to have a wet day. It was a season of the year when
we might always expect rain, so that outside gatherings were to a
great extent spoiled for that reason. Next came a howl from
mechanics all over the country that leases expired on that day,
and that was the general moving day and labor was badly needed.
As a mechanic in the building line I found that that was the
truth. For the last ten or twelve years in Chicago I have been
able to obtain double pay on that day. I know I have made as high
as $10 and $12 on that day. Now, it may be that the capitalist
was helped along just as much, but I don&rsquo;t care how much
the capitalist makes, as long as I make enough. It don&rsquo;t
make any difference how much he makes if I happen to make
something too, but I don&rsquo;t want him to make so much that I
shall be starved thereby. I want my share of it. I think it is
wiser to adopt the Labor Day that so much time and so much money
has been spent to establish all over the country, the first
Monday in September. At that month you have delegates here from
all over the country, and you will find that that month is the
best month in the year for almost any kind of a gathering,
whether the delegates will have an outdoor or indoor gathering.
It is the best time in the year for good weather and a pleasant
time generally all over the country. You cannot find any month in
the year when you have the same equal temperature all ever the
country that you will find in the month of September. To change
the Labor Day would make confusion amongst organized labor. Let
us keep organized labor with us in this body as much as we can.
Let us raise as few obstacles and make as little change in the
way that they are doing business now as we can. The same changes
you make here, the same changes are going to be made by organized
labor, because, delegates, I believe the time is going to came
when organized labor must turn to such a movement as this. I have
carried that prayer book, that card (exhibiting his union due
book and card), in my pocket since 1881, and I must say that I
been enabled to live up to it. Now, what is the use of professing
any religion or any creed if we don&rsquo;t live up to it? Every
time there has been an election I have listened to the speakers,
and I have found at the conclusion of the speech that if you are
going to get anything you must help yourselves a little bit too.
If you only listen to what others tell you, and lay down or sit
in a chair and plead, you can plead for a long time and get
nothing if you don&rsquo;t try to help yourselves.</p>
<p>(The speaker told an anecdote of a bread man whose wagon
tipped over, and while the mail sat down to think over the
situation a lot of hogs along the roadside helped themselves to
the bread, the man learning from the hogs that the way to get
along in this world is to help yourself a little.)</p>
<p>Now, it seems to me it is immaterial to this organization what
day we have for a labor holiday, but you have got it so well and
so satisfactorily and so perfectly established now by organized
labor, that I hope to see that day made one of the features of
this organization.</p>
<p>DEL. VEAL: Mr. Chairman and fellow delegates, I stand with the
spirit of the resolution. I stand with it because it expresses
the aspirations of the Labor Day of the revolutionists of the
world. (Applause.) Why am I opposed to the remarks of this
delegate on this floor this morning? He said that there is a
Labor Day that has been built in the United States by organized
labor, and that that gives us something. Let us look into the
action of the labor day established under the auspices of the
American Federation of Labor. In the mining camps of this country
and the large cities on Labor Day you will see hosts of
un-class-conscious men follow whom? Follow the capitalist riding
in the carriage, the capitalist politicians, the men who are
sucking the blood out of tile. (Applause.) And they take them
down to the park and look into their faces and tell them how
intelligent they are, and at the same time they know they are
using them as dupes. In the State of Colorado, Gov. Peabody and
the men who drove the miners out of the Cripple Creek district,
they too celebrate and uphold this so-called Labor Day, that the
capitalist class of America gave to the American Federation of
Labor as a boon after they had begged for it. We want to have a
Labor Day that is so distinct and so clean-cut that no man who
to-day works in the mills and the mines of this country but will
recognize the spirit that is there. In the Western Federation
Magazine I read a few weeks ago an article which said that out in
Utah the members of that organization, the black man, the
Italian, the Frenchman, men of every nationality, stopped work on
that day, and they marched behind the international colors with
that inspiration that the first of May is the true expression of
the working class. We care not whether it rains. Admitting the
fact that it is a weather proposition front a bourgeois
standpoint, and they consult the astronomer or the weather man;
why? Because, they are looking after the profits proposition. Put
we are consulting this morning the spirit in this as the founders
gave it to us. Karl Marx, Engels, and the leaders of the
international European workingmen. Attempts have been made to
crush that spirit, but time and again on that day balloons have
been sent up, and on those balloons the international colors
representing the workingman&rsquo;s holiday have not been
suppressed. Why do we want an understanding with the
world&rsquo;s workers? That is what we are here for. We do not
want an understanding with the American Federation of Labor. And
I deny that it has ever been an expression of the working class
or can express their aims and desires, because it is a capitalist
organization. Now, then, the point is here: We have got to have a
Labor Day that is so far removed from the craft proposition that
we will show clearly to our class our solidarity with the sailors
on the Black Sea, one of whom refused to eat the food that the
ship had given out to those sailors, and the man who refused to
eat that was immediately shot. And what was the result? That man
was taken into the nearest city, and the proletariat marched out
to look at that slave, that wage slave of the Russian empire, and
when they did that, instantly the international colors went up,
and that gave the workers in other ports inspiration. To-day we
want to fly the colors of the Labor Day of the working class so
that we can show that we have the spirit, that we have the
revolutionary spirit, and that we are not going to fly the colors
of a reactionary capitalist organization, as far as the Socialist
Trade and Labor Alliance is concerned.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: The world is never going to be saved by
cowards. If any men or women come here who do not express
themselves, they are cowards. We came here to lay the foundation
for a worldwide movement, and I respect every man or woman who
expresses his ideas. Yesterday I met a friend of mine, one of
those great labor leader newspapermen. I asked him, &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you say anything about this convention?&rdquo; He
says, &ldquo;Well, I will tell you something new.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I am willing to learn.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that the
capitalist class knows that the greatest intellects of the
greatest organizations have come here in this hall to try to
establish an organization which will make the tyrants tremble?
Therefore we don&rsquo;t mention anything about it in the
papers.&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;Why do you give attention all
the time to the American Federation of Labor?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that is a horse of another
color.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; He said&ldquo; I
will tell you why. The policy of the American Federation of Labor
is dictated by the capitalist class. Their aim is to try to keep
the workingman&rsquo;s brains like the mule&rsquo;s, his stomach
just full enough to keep his constitution in working order. That
is the reason they talk about the great American Federation of
Labor.&rdquo; If the workingman used his brains like a man he
would not be so willing to produce capitalist profits for his
masters. Four years ago I was on a lecture tour, and stopped at a
town on Labor Day, and a great labor fakir was telling the
workingman how intelligent he was. And do you know why? It was
right before election. But after election they go to the masters
and say, &ldquo;You see those cows? I call them intelligent. How
much will you give? They are for sale.&rdquo; Now, why should the
first of May be called Labor Day? I don&rsquo;t care whether you
call it the 1st or the 15th of May, but I want it in this month
when the trees commence to bloom and the flowers show their
beauties and the earth puts on its brightest colors. That month I
want for the proletariat of the world. Let us use the tactics
that have been found successful. Do you know why the great
warriors never start in September? Because they fear the snow
will soon come and they will not be victorious. But if the great
sun will shine they can commence in May and their undertaking can
be finished before June. Let us adopt May as the workers&rsquo;
day of the international toilers&rsquo; union.</p>
<p>DEL. LUELLA TWINING: I am in favor of the first of May because
it will work for the solidarity of labor. When the question of a
national holiday was brought up Mark Hanna asked the government
not to name the first of May because that is associated with
Socialism, and well he knew that Socialism worked for the
solidarity of labor, and that labor when united would be a force
that would sweep them out of existence. In Denver, Colorado, the
Citizens&rsquo; Alliance and the labor organizations all march in
September. We do not want a capitalist Labor Day. Let us have a
labor day of our own. Let us have an international labor day, the
first day of May. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Mr. Chairman and delegates, I think that the
discussion now going on is indicative of the spirit, and, if you
will excuse the expression, the absolute unpracticality of this
convention.</p>
<p>DELEGATES: Sit down.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I listened to you; please listen to me. I am a
delegate to this convention, and I don&rsquo;t sit down for
anybody, and until the Chairman tells me to sit down I shall
refuse to do so till I finish. I want to make this short and
sweet. Now, Mr. President, we have been using these words so
long, &ldquo;class-conscious,&rdquo; &ldquo;solidarity,&rdquo;
&ldquo;historical,&rdquo; and so forth, that they have
degenerated into a jargon. As. Brother Debs very clearly stated
the other day, we are continually looking for these bugaboos, and
we find them where they are not. I say this, that admitting
everything that has been said by the other side to be true, there
is absolutely nothing to the contention or the mass of sentiment
in regard to an international labor holiday. If you are going to
impress your ideas and imbue the workers of this country with
your ideas, go out where you will meet them on labor day already
adopted, because if you succeed in establishing a labor day on
the first of May that would be as generally observed as the first
Monday in September is, if the capitalist is going to reach the
laborer and do all these things to him that you claim have been
done, he is going to do it on the first of May just as much as he
would do it on the first Monday of September. You have no means
of preventing him from doing that, and you are wasting your
energies on non-essentials. You are going to be absolutely
uncompromising, but let me tell you that when you come to deal
with the serious problems that this convention confronts you will
find the unpracticability of the people here to deal with those
problems. This is sentiment pure and simple. We also hear of
graft all around, graft everywhere. I want to say in conclusion
that there is an old and trite saying that those who live in
glass houses should not throw stones.</p>
<p>Del. McEachren moved the previous question. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The previous question has been called for. All
those in favor signify by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is
carried. The motion before the house is that we concur in the
recommendation of the committee. All those in favor signify it by
saying aye. Contrary no. The ayes seem to have it. The motion is
carried, and it is so recorded.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: There is a whole lot of delegates that did not
vote at all. That vote cannot be relied on. Let them raise their
hands.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: All those in favor of the motion will signify it
by raising their right hands. Contrary by the same sign. There
are four dissenting votes. The resolution and the recommendation
of the committee are adopted. The report of, the Committee on
Resolutions will be resumed.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Resolution No. 14: &ldquo;Resolved, That this new
industrial organization be instituted on July 4th as Independence
Day for the wage earners.&rdquo; The committee recommends that
this resolution be laid on the table.</p>
<p>It was moved that the convention concur in the report of the
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. WRIGHT: I move that the resolution be laid on the
table.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order. Your committee
recommends that this be laid on the table. If you desire to
concur or non-concur in the report of your committee, do so.</p>
<p>The motion to concur was seconded, and being put, was
carried.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Resolution No. 6: &ldquo;Resolved, That seceding
workers and seceding organizations from the A. F. of L. be
required to make a public statement of the reasons for their
secession, and furthermore that the rank and file of any seceding
organization be thoroughly informed by a course of lectures or
otherwise of our Manifesto and plan of organization before they
be eligible to membership in the industrial union. (Endorsed by
the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club of Cincinnati). The report of
your committee is that Resolution No. 6 be laid on the table.</p>
<p>DEL. MILLER: I move you that the recommendation of the
committee be concurred in. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The recommendation of the committee is that the
resolution be laid on the table. It has been regularly moved and
seconded that the recommendation of the committee be concurred
in.</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: I want to ask the committee why that
resolution should be laid on the table. Isn&rsquo;t it true that
we must educate the working class? And if they do secede from the
A. F. of L. this body should know why. We discussed that
resolution at Cincinnati, and we came to this conclusion.
Isn&rsquo;t that a great propaganda to show the workers of the A.
F. of L why they are seceding from them? I am surprised at the
committee recommending laying that resolution on the table. Are
we afraid of those things or what? We must show up the fakirs of
the A. F. of L. If the A. F. of L. is all right, if you are only
breaking away from them because you want a different organization
with a new president, let us know that. If the underlying
principle of the organization is rotten, if there is corruption
there that everybody should see, why should not those seceding
organizations have that explained to the world? I hope the
convention will not lay this on the table.</p>
<p>DEL. FITZGERALD: As a member of the Resolution Committee, I
wish to say that there are several points to come out in that
resolution. If I thoroughly understand the call for this
convention and the position of the majority of the delegates
present, we do not recognize any labor organization that is now
in existence, and we do not want to have it said that we are
seceding, if such may be the case. The reason for this resolution
being tabled is this: that no body, whether it be a local,
national or international body, that is educated enough to grasp
the meaning of this convention or this organization, will be
seceding. We do not want to go on record as such. Therefore your
committee, after a heated discussion between the several members,
has decided that that resolution is not in order in this
convention, and that is why the recommendation was submitted to
this delegation. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. TRAUTMANN: In addition to the arguments against the
proposition or report of the committee, I wish to say this: that
the intent of the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club of Cincinnati in
presenting this resolution was to avoid the secession of the
disgruntled elements, discouraged on account of some industrial
conditions, perhaps, without knowing the underlying principles of
the industrial union movement, and avoid bringing an organization
into the industrial union movement without the rank and file
knowing the difference between the A. F. of L. and the true labor
organization that was to be formed in Chicago, and before we
should ever proceed to take in old organizations on account of
some disgruntled element we wished the world to know the reason
why they withdrew from the organization with which they were
formerly connected. It is not to create secession; it is to
prevent secession from the organization when the rank and file is
not ripe to become a part of a labor organization of this kind.
If the organizations draw out, as we had an instance, because of
dissatisfaction with the management, and the members were not
educated in the principles of this industrial movement, they
would not be desired, because the same system of corruption would
have full sway even though they joined this new industrial union
movement. If they withdrew because the rank and file are ripe to
become a part of this organization, they should so express
themselves through a resolution showing that they are ripe. Then
when they are ripe we will have averted conflicts of jurisdiction
and they will be the right kind of men, for the simple reason
that a man who is imbued with the principles of this organization
will never scab while in other organizations. For these reasons,
and to have all these points brought out before the working class
when an organization is dissatisfied, in order that they may know
that they have just reasons for dissatisfaction with the
management and methods of the old labor organizations, and with
the object of having a body of men ripe to become a part of this
organization, this resolution was presented, and I hope the
recommendation of the committee will not prevail.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: The Committee
on Resolutions, without a single exception, I believe, were in
harmony with the spirit or sentiment of this resolution; there
isn&rsquo;t any question about that. They only recommended that
it be laid on the table because they do not believe that this
convention ought to go on record at this time as demanding the
things that are in this resolution; that is, making them
obligatory upon these organizations. There are three points, I
believe, in the resolution that we discussed, and I will try to
lay them before this convention. In the first place, this
resolution brands practically every organization that leaves
another and comes into this one as secessionists. Now, we do not
propose to have that brand put upon any men and women who are
brave enough to leave some old movement and come into the new
movement. (Applause). That is exactly the brand the other fellow
will put on them, and we did not believe it was our duty to aid
him in branding them as such. They are not secessionists. It
further requires that every organization leaving or seceding from
the American Federation of Labor shall make a public statement of
the reasons for their secession. Well, now, the committee thought
that if the organizations seceding or leaving the A. F. of L.
desired to make a public statement that was a matter for the
local organization to decide. The mere fact that we do not adopt
this resolution does not prevent any organization from showing up
the fakirs as the brother who has introduced this resolution so
persistently thinks that we ought to show them up. If the local
organization has a good reason, a reason they believe ought to go
to the public in the interest of the labor movement, they
certainly have that right. (Applause). But we ought not to
require them if they do not desire to make that kind of a public
statement. The fact that we lay this resolution on the table does
not prevent them or take away that right from any local
organization. The next proposition is that before we receive them
into this organization they must be thoroughly informed or
instructed in a course of lectures or otherwise as to the
principles of this organization. I want to say, brothers, that
personally as a member of that committee, I believe that that
would require within the next three months, or six months at the
most, three or four thousand lecturers travelling from one end of
the country to the other trying to instruct organizations that
are coming with us, when perhaps the rank and file of those
organizations know as well the reason why they are coming into
this movement as industrial unionists as do the lecturers that
would go there to deliver the course and take up their time.
(Applause). Whenever the organization decide to sever their
relations with the old movement and come into the new, I want to
say that there is a spirit there or there is an intelligence
there that believes in the principles of the industrial movement,
and they are not leaving the old one simply because of some
little petty reason or some little petty abuse on the part of the
officers, either national or international. They are coming into
this new movement because they believe it is right, because they
have the spirit of revolt, because they have the spirit of the
new organization and the emancipation of the wage earners behind
them, and I want to grasp the hands of that man and that woman
just as speedily as possible, and I want them to get into the
rank and file of this organization before perhaps it is necessary
for us to send a man from some other part of the country to give
them a course of lectures. The very conditions of to-day are
fitting them for the industrial movement, and just as soon as
they come into a position where they want to come to us, let us
stretch out the hand of helpfulness and brotherhood and take them
in. I think that was the entire reason of the committee, and the
committee deemed it sufficient to recommend that this resolution
be laid on the table.</p>
<p>DEL. KNIGHT: Brother Chairman and Brother Delegates, I believe
that that resolution belongs properly to the administration of
the new organization, the spirit of that resolution; that is
where it belongs. I think this, that if we adopt such a
resolution as that&mdash;not that I am not thoroughly in accord
with the spirit of it, as I said the other day that education
should be the basis of this organization&mdash;but we will make
the thing so clumsy that we will be unable to handle it, like the
old ox cart whose wheels were hewed out of a log. I want to say
this, and I think, if my motion would be in order, that the
proper thing to do with that is to refer that resolution to the
Constitution Committee, and they may get suggestions out of that
in considering the portion of the constitution which deals with
administration that will be helpful to them. If my motion is in
order, I move as a substitute that that resolution be referred to
the Constitution Committee. I think that is where it properly
belongs. I think that if we form this organization right and we
have an officership that is thoroughly in spirit with this, that
they will take care of that. We are a representative body. We may
not be as democratic as they used to be in the olden times in the
town halls when the colonists personally met and directed
affairs. Therefore, I think my motion would be perfectly in
order, and I move as a substitute that that resolution be
referred to the Constitution Committee. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Was that motion seconded?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The substitute is seconded.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move you that this resolution be referred back
to the Committee on Resolutions. The Chairman of the committee
made very clear to me that the resolution as presented to them
was in crude condition, but he did not make clear to me why they
should not have done with that resolution what they did with the
other one, the first one, rewrite it, remove the crudeness and
present it in an acceptable manner. The resolution has two parts;
one of them is utterly impracticable, this matter of the
educational course in advance. I do not wish to be severe on the
gentleman who introduced it, but if you will indulge me I will
say it is childish. The first part as to demanding of them a
statement has a correct thought, but as the chairman of the
committee very well expresses it, it should not be made
mandatory; it should not be required, but they should be
requested; it is desirable that such a statement be made ; and I
consider that if that resolution is referred back, and if the
committee will do with that resolution what it did with the other
one; chew it over and present it in a new garb, leaving out what
is impracticable and putting in what is good, we will have
something that is worth putting in among our resolutions. The
chairman of the committee very correctly stated that we do not
want to seem to be a band of secessionists, but I tell you that
if an organization which is in existence states why it joins us
it does not need to say why it &ldquo;secedes.&rdquo; If you want
to split hairs upon that, or if one want to, we cannot prevent
him. But unless an organization in existence states why it
changes its status and joins us, the doors are open for making
this new organization a cave of Adulam, a gathering place for
soreheads, who, because a man or woman does a thing that does not
suit them in another organization, can get out and, like,
chickens, go roosting with some one else. It is desirable that if
a body in existence finds that its place is here, it make a
public statement of why it decided to change its status. The case
has been well stated by the Cincinnati organization, and the idea
should be to sift out of that resolution the good points. The
individual members in these constituent organizations have not
had the opportunity and the parliamentary experience of the
chairman of the Resolutions Committee, and they presented the
matter in a crude form. It is for the chairman of the committee
and for that committee in general to polish it up and leave out
what is not desirable and save what is good. For that reason I
move you that this resolution be referred back to the Committee
on Resolutions.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I second that motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the resolution be referred back to the Committee on Resolutions.
Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I wish to speak on that point. I want it referred
back to the Committee on Resolutions, because I think every one
here agrees that there are some things that we want to see
embodied here. We are all practically agreed on the fact that
every possible effort should be made to make clear and plain to
the entire membership of this organization its purposes, aims and
methods. and that it should be not simply a class struggle
organization, but a class conscious struggling organization.
(Applause). At the same time I feel that we are going to make a
great mistake if the spirit goes out from that resolution and
from this convention that the main reason for the existence of
this organization is to hunt around like sleuths and then
constitute ourselves into a mere organization of brickbat
throwers to hit particular scoundrels that float on the scum of a
defunct labor movement. It seems to me that we have something
else that is better to do. And in the second place, I believe
that we ought to understand that men are coming into this
organization, if it grows, who are not going to understand, when
they come in, why they come. They are going to come from class
antagonism. They are going to come in because the class struggle
is a fact born of industrial conditions, not an idea hatched in
the brain of theorists; and when those men come into this body I
believe we ought to stand there and welcome them into it; not
stand there with an examination question; not stand there with
some intellectual would-be what-not ready to deliver to that man
who is fighting at the front a fine-spun lecture on the theories
that are to lead to his ultimate emancipation; but we ought to
stand there at the door of this organization with open hands, and
say to that man whose hand is against the master, &ldquo;Our
hearts are with you in your fight.&rdquo; (Applause). I have more
faith in the rank and file of the working class of America, blind
as they may be, mistakes though they have made, than I have in
all the intellectuals and all, the lecturers and all the soap box
orators&mdash;and I have been one of them for years and expect to
be&mdash;I have more faith in the rank and file and the spirit of
revolt that springs out of the work shop than I have, I say, in
all the theorists and would-be teachers of the working class of
America. (Applause). And I think that sometimes we who pride
ourselves on our ability to teach, should go back to the masses
and learn. (Applause). And I want to say that the thing that
brought me into this organization as an individual, and I believe
it will move others, was that I saw within the working class of
America a tremendous revolt against the capitalist class, a
revolt that was absolutely unable to express itself in the old
trade union organizations; and it is because that revolt exists
that this organization is going to be a success, and not because
of any beautiful sentences that I and others may utter in the
literature that we send out or the lectures that we make. If we
found ourselves on the recognition of that fact, then we will be
founded on the class struggle, and on no other condition can it
be, and I hope that that spirit and that point of view may be
embodied in this resolution. I support the motion that has just
been made. (Applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is that the resolution be referred
back to the Committee on Resolutions. Are you ready for the
question ?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I just want to say another word against the
motion to refer. I do not believe, fellow delegates, that it is
necessary to take any action on this resolution. I believe we are
simply wasting the time of this convention to refer it and bring
it back for further discussion in this convention. I do not
believe that there is a single, solitary delegate on this floor
who has discussed it that can see anything in this resolution
except a purely administrative function when this new
organization attempts to band itself with this movement. As
Delegate Knight clearly pointed out, that is all there is in the
resolution. That is all that the Resolution Committee can get out
of it. Now, any one who has ever had any experience in the labor
movement knows that an organization that desires to become
attached to a body sends individual delegates. They give their
reasons why they wish to do so. They give their membership. They
give their class or craft or trade. They give innumerable other
details of their organization. The executive committee that
grants the charter investigates. Every labor organization does
that. That is a part of the administrative work of the
organization. Now, they are going to do that here. That is all we
can ask them to do. Then why send it back to a committee that has
been over it and have them spend further time with it and bring
it back here with another discussion of this, that or the other
feature and waste the time of the convention? I think we should
leave that to be outlined in the constitution, and then if it is
not outlined in the constitution there is a modus operandi that
the committee will have to go through in order to bring this new
body or that old body into this organization.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is that the resolution be referred
back to the Resolution Committee. All in favor will signify it by
saying aye. Contrary, no.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Division.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair is in doubt. Those in favor of
referring this resolution to the Resolution Committee will raise
their right hands. The Secretary will count. Contrary, raise your
hands. The motion to refer is lost. The question is the original
motion to concur in the report of the Resolution Committee, which
is to lay the resolution on the table. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for). Those in favor will signify it
by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried, and it is so
ordered.</p>
<h4>MEMBERSHIP REPRESENTED</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There was one of the delegates yesterday that
asked for some information. This is for the benefit of Delegate
Rowe if he is here. There are seventy delegates here with power
to install, representing 51,430 members. There are seventy-two
delegates here representing other unions aggregating 91,500
members. There are sixty-one individual delegates. A total
aggregation of 142,995. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: A point of information. I would like to ask,
will the congress meet to-morrow? Will the congress meet
Sunday?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is a question that will probably be decided
later.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I ask that, because if not I would like to make
a proposition.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just wait till we have the report of the
Resolution Committee.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION</h4>
<p>DEL. COATES: Resolution No. 10, by Delegate E. Bosky:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, A knowledge of economic laws is not apparent
in this convention; and</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, The construction of a new constitution for a
new economic movement depends on the quality of the constructive
material used for the purpose;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resolved, That this convention decide upon a time when
a discussion on this subject is to take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Committee on Resolutions recommend that this resolution be
laid on the table. (Seconded). Mr. Chairman, just to save time, I
will say that the committee simply thinks that it means taking up
another day or two days&rsquo; time of the convention without any
apparent result.</p>
<p>The resolution to lay on the table was then put and
carried.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: That is the end of the report.</p>
<h4>COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Committee on Ways and Means. Has the Committee
on Ways and Means any report to make?</p>
<p>DEL. MCKINNON: The Secretary of the Ways and Means Committee
has handed his report in to the Secretary of the
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: The Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has
asked me to read this report:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inasmuch as the convention has expressed its desire to
have a stenographic report of this convention; and inasmuch as
funds must be provided to pay the temporary expenses and to
launch this organization, we, the Ways and Means Committee, find
by actual computation that an assessment of five cents per member
of the entire membership of this new organization will bring at
once, if acted upon, $2,500 or near about; a sum amply sufficient
to cover all necessary expenses such as a stenographic report and
temporary expenses. In view of this, we, your Committee on Ways
and Means, fraternally submit the following report: We recommend
an assessment of five cents per member of the full membership to
cover the temporary expenses of the convention; first, to secure
a stenographic report; second, to launch the new
organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have the report of your Committee on Ways
and Means. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I move you that this report be referred
back to the Committee on Ways and Means with instructions to make
an assessment of one dollar instead of five cents. Perhaps a
better way would be to amend the report submitted by the
committee, and I would make my motion in the nature of an
amendment to the report, that the amount of the assessment be one
dollar instead of five cents. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the report of the committee be amended by making the assessment
one dollar instead of five cents. You have heard the motion. Are
you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: As a member of
that committee, I want to say that your Committee on Ways and
Means consulted the Secretary of this convention as to the
already existing indebtedness of the same and the probabilities
as to what it would amount to. It is already $160, with a
probability of reaching $200. We took into consideration your
expression in favor of a stenographic report, which it has been
stated here would cost $600. We have asked the Secretary to make
an estimate upon a membership of 50,000. You have already heard
from the Chairman this morning that there are delegates here that
represent 142,ooo members. Your Committee on Ways and Means,
while we have had the assurance of one of these organizations
ready to merge its membership into this new organization, that
they would pay $300 of the $600 necessary for the stenographic
report, yet the wisdom of that committee was this: that every man
and every woman who became members of this organization, we were
satisfied, would desire to have his or her equal share of the
burden of the expense of the convention and stenographic report,
and consequently we made the assessment five cents on 50,000
members, which would make $2,500; $600 probably covering the
stenographic report and $200 for the temporary expenses of the
convention and leaving $1,700 in the treasury of the new
organization. Now we bring this report to you for your acceptance
or rejection. Some have said to me this morning that the
Committee on Constitution would make provision for a per capita
tax. We have got nothing to do with that. I consulted the
chairman of this committee, and we decided to provide in this way
for the temporary organization and expenses. I admire the spirit
that would make the assessment a dollar, but we took into
consideration that the probabilities are that by that assessment
you will have $200,000, and this committee I do not believe has
power to make that assessment without the assurance of the
representatives of these organizations who will compose the
larger share of the membership of the new organization, and for
that reason I sought this floor as a member of that committee,
knowing that once before a proposed assessment of $4 from the
Ways and Means Committee had been referred back. You can see that
a small assessment of five cents per capita would cover the
expense of the convention and stenographic report and leave
$1,700 in your treasury; and then let the report of the
Constitution Committee come in with the per capita tax and
initiation fee to provide funds for the further carrying on of
the business and work of the new industrial organization.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I would say that we should not wait for a per
capita tax. This money is needed right now. I believe we should
raise this money and that the committee have no right to levy an
assessment for the future.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I regret that Brother Smith amended his motion.
I regret it all the more because I may be misunderstood when I
oppose his second motion, namely to assess the membership one
dollar. I regret that he did not stick to his original motion to
refer this matter, because I think that in that way the matter
can be presented more clearly. I am in favor of assessing the
membership of this new organization one dollar per capita. I
believe this organization, when started, will need all of that
fund for its administrative and agitational and organizing work;
but it is for that very reason that I do not like to see this
motion as it stands, where the dollar is to cover not only the
organizing expenses and the other debts of this convention, but
also the stenographic report. Now, all of you who have had any
experience in the matter of collecting taxes&mdash;and this is a
tax&mdash;know that it takes time and money to collect that tax.
Brother Sherman, when he discussed the stenographic report on the
floor, correctly stated&mdash;partly correctly&mdash;that as the
matter stood this stenographic report would be a matter of
history when it came to be published, and in that case $600 would
not be too little. It would be, in my opinion, $600 too much. Any
amount of money, however small, spent for the stenographic
report, if that report would have to wait six, eight, ten or
twelve months to be issued, will be too large, in my opinion. It
would be substantially wasted, and that is something that I hope
we will be able to avoid. When this body goes into existence the
General Executive Board, the general administrative officers,
will have their hands full; their hands full collecting the funds
necessary to carry on the organization; their hands full to
collect funds for the purpose of organizing; and I do not believe
that one dollar apiece for the membership will be enough to meet
those expenditures, and the result of it will be that the
stenographic report will have to go by the board. I repeat it
here, $600, and I do not agree with Delegate Coates who said it
will cost five thousand or anything like that. I said $600 after
consultation with the stenographer. The $600 is not so large a
sum, but it is $600 too much if we are not going to have it
within a month or so, and the benefits will be absolutely lost,
and the result will be that the proposition of Delegate Smith
would be either a dead letter or will be a waste of time and
money. Now, taking the sense of the house from the various
discussions that have preceded upon this subject, I would ask
leave of the house to withdraw the proposition made by the Daily
People through the delegation of the S. T. &amp; L. A.&mdash;to
withdraw that proposition so that this convention as an official
body shall have no liability whatever; because if this convention
is to have any liability it is clear to me that that report never
will be had. The stenographer is not going to get out his
transcript if he has not got some assurance of cash payment when
he makes it. It will be a number of months before the convention
will be prepared for that purpose. If this convention allows me
to withdraw that proposition we shall then proceed to publish a
stenographic report and gather the funds in the same manner that
we have gathered them so far, by voluntary contributions, which
are being acknowledged in The People. I consulted Brother
Haggerty, of the Butte Smeltermen&rsquo;s Union, and he expressed
his willingness to receive whatever voluntary contributions any
delegates should choose to give toward publishing this
stenographic report as soon as this convention adjourns. If you
give him voluntary contributions you will give the names of the
contributors, and their names will be acknowledged in the Daily
People, and according to the assurance of the stenographer within
twenty or thirty days we can begin it. I hope I am understood. In
view of this, I move you as an amendment that one dollar
assessment be levied upon every member of this organization
towards paying the expenses of the necessary work of the officers
when the new organization is launched, meaning thereby also the
expenses which have been incurred for this convention and the
general expense of the convention, and that the matter of the
stenographic report be excluded and left where it was before this
convention met. Is that understood?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I believe I get the purport of the motion. It is
rather lengthy. Do I hear a second to that motion?</p>
<p>DEL. MCEACHREN: I second the motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Comrade De Leon, will you kindly reduce your
motion to writing? I think I can state it, however.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: For the benefit of the Secretary I would like to
have it reduced to writing. The motion is that there be an
assessment of one dollar levied to carry on the work of this
organization when launched, and that the matter of the
stenographic report be not considered at this time. Is that the
motion?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: No, I want to leave the expense of the
stenographic report out altogether.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, that the matter of the stenographic report
be left out altogether. Brother Hall has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: It occurs to me that the discussion of this report
of the committee and also the motions that have been predicated
upon it are entirely out of order, for the reason that this body
has no power to assess the membership that they represent. There
is a time set aside when all individuals and organizations will
be initiated into this new movement, but it is set for a time
after the report of the Constitutional Committee. Last January a
little handful of men met in Chicago for the purpose of launching
this movement. There were less than thirty. We realized that
there was an expense devolving upon us amounting almost to $200.
We had no organization to assess. We had nothing but our own
selves to rely upon. The Executive Committee, five members
appointed by that conference to look after this matter of
finance, was simply instructed to get the money without involving
the conference. This committee did it. This stenographic report
is a document that is to be used for the propagation of this
movement from a world-wide standpoint. If there is a demand for
this document we will not require an assessment of the membership
to meet it. If there is no demand for it, it would be a crime to
assess our membership. Now, there has already been provision
made, if I understand, for the shorthand notes of this convention
to be taken. Now, I would favor the creation of a committee from
this convention who will have in their charge the handling of
these notes, and if they can see their way clear without an
assessment of the membership to have them printed and scattered
broadcast over the world I am in favor of that. But I believe the
world should pay for it. If the world wants it, if the membership
want it after our organization has been effected, then make it. I
think the motion is entirely out of order. I think the report of
the committee is out of place, because we have no power to vote
an assessment upon our membership until after we have installed
them into this new organization, and then only through regular
channels, That is why I oppose every motion that has been
predicated upon the report of the committee, and would offer a
substitute if I am in order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The substitute will be recognized.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL (continuing) That a committee of five be appointed
by the chair, whose duty it will be, not to make a report to this
convention, but whose duty it will be to handle this proposition
until the next convention of this organization.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: What proposition?</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I do not believe that we should be burdened with
anything of that kind now.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: What proposition?</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I have stood in opposition to it always, and see no
necessity for it. There is much in this report that the world
will not want, and it is only a matter of file for the general
offices, and it can lie on file in its present state as well as
though it was printed and bound in vellum. Therefore I move you
that a committee of five be appointed to look after this matter,
with positive instructions that they must not bring any report
which considers an assessment of the membership of this
organization. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair feels that such a motion would be out
of order. If this new organization is launched, the business of
the organization must of necessity be conducted by the
administration of the organization which will be launched. If the
chair may be permitted, it occurs to me that a substitute to
defer action on this until the report of the Constitution
Committee, would just about have covered the matter.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I accept such a substitute.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: May I have a word to say about this?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have already spoken on this proposition,
Brother Schatzke.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I think that it is due me and due the convention,
that since you have ruled my motion out of order&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just as a matter of personal privilege.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL (continuing): &mdash;to restate this proposition and
make this matter clear.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is just a matter of privilege; not to make a
motion.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: No, not to make a motion. But I believe the chair
is wrong, if he will think over his ruling, because this is a
matter that belongs to the convention and not to the
organization.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have a right to appeal from the decision of
the chair if it is wrong.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: No, I don&rsquo;t want to do that, but I just want
to call attention to that as the reason; I just want to explain
that as my reason for making this motion, that this document does
not properly belong to the organization; it belongs to the
convention and is in the hands of the delegation of the S. T.
&amp; L. A., where it will remain.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Hall, permit the chair to explain to you
that the document, is not under discussion; that the amendment
entirely disconnects the stenographic report from the proposition
of levying an assessment, and plainly states that it shall not be
considered. Delegate McDonald has the floor to speak on the
amendment to the amendment, which is to levy an assessment of one
dollar.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: It is not an amendment to the amendment. It is
an amendment to the motion. The delegate wished to make a motion
to refer, but he immediately withdrew that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Permit the chair to explain the position of the
report of your committee at this time. A motion was made to
concur in the report of the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Del. Smith amended that motion by making the
assessment one dollar instead of five cents. Delegate De Leon
amended the amendment by setting aside the stenographic report
entirely, and levying the assessment if launched. Is that
correct?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: I desire to say that I am not in favor
of the report of the committee at this time, neither am I in
favor of the amendment to the report, neither am I in favor of
the amendment to the amendment. But I propose to make a motion
without any argument, for I think that the people here understand
the proposition sufficiently well without any argument. I move
you, Mr. Chairman, as a motion,&mdash;it is a motion&mdash;to
refer or defer action on this proposition until after the
Constitution Committee has reported. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A motion has been made to defer action until the
Constitution Committee has reported. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for).</p>
<p>DEL. WALKER: I am one of those delegates that are simply here
for information, sent by our District Council in conjunction with
other delegates sent by the district convention to this
convention for the same purpose. There are, notwithstanding the
statements made on the floor of this convention, a good many
members of our organization who are just as interested in this
movement and will go just as far and do just as much to see a
success made of it as any representative of any other
organization that is at this convention to-day. Mr. Chairman, we
want to be honest with you and let you know just what our
position is, and then treat us as you think best. Now, in
deferring action on this proposition until after the Constitution
Committee has reported, I expect possibly you will have in mind
then another proposition under discussion to be handled by the
representatives of the different organizations who are here to
make a permanent organization of this institution. Now, there is
one thing that I want to make clear, and that is this, that the
only way that it will be possible to get the members of the rank
and file of our organization to that place where they will make
the fight necessary to have our organizations brought in line
with this movement, the only thing that you can do is to educate
them as to what this movement means. Now, there are a great many
things said that I do not agree with, but there are a great many
things that have been said that I would like to see our
organization in a position to get them and read them and
thoroughly understand them, and I think you will find that they
will take occasion to prove that they as well as the workers of
every other organization are with the workers of the world in
trying to emancipate themselves. I would like to see every
statement that has been made here&mdash;the stenographer I
understand has taken them&mdash;I would like to see them both
transcribed and printed, and printed in such shape that we will
be able to furnish every member of all the organizations with a
copy of them. I think that if you will do that, it will have more
to do with the effect desired of bringing our membership to the
place we want them than millions of dollars spent in explaining
the nature of the movement in order to reach the individuals. We
are willing&mdash;at least I am willing as a representative of
the sub-district&mdash;to pledge ourselves to pay any reasonable
amount to justify ourselves in having a stenographic report of
this convention made, transcribed and printed, but in such a
shape that we will be in a position to be able to get it when we
want it and be in the hands of every member of our organization.
I believe the delegates that are here, regardless of whether they
are going to affiliate immediately, with power to become a part
of the organization, or whether they are here representing
organizations for information, or whether they are here as
individuals representing themselves, should bear the expense of
getting this complete report, and then take that report and make
use of it as propaganda in this movement. That is what I would
like to see done. That is what I am prepared to commit our
organization to pay their share of the expense in getting done,
and that is what I would like to see done.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is to defer action on this report
until the Constitution Committee has reported. (Question called
for.)</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman and Delegates: I am in favor of the
motion to refer this whole question as last made. I am one of
those delegates who are here with full power to install the
organization that I represent into the new organization that is
to be born in this convention. But I do not say that I am here
with authority to place a load upon the membership of the
organization that I represent. I believe that the cart is before
the horse when we begin to talk about taxation upon the
possibility of that which we are in hopes will be a part of this
organization. Every child that is born into this world is born
with a debt over his head that he never can pay off; and for
God&rsquo;s sake, let us not create a debt with this organization
without the rank and file that has got to liquidate this debt has
got something to say whether they are willing to take that
contract or not. It is very easy for us to resolute here a
taxation upon the rank and file that is in the factory and in the
field and in the mine, toiling from day to day, but it is not
easy for them to get meat and bread and pay for it and liquidate
the debts that we will contract here. Hence I am opposed to any
assessment that is going to load down financially the workers of
this country. That is supposed to be the intention of this
assessment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Sherman, permit the chair to say that
you are not talking to the question. This is simply a matter of
deferring action on this report until such time as the
Constitution Committee has reported.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I believe the brother that made the motion had a
reason for deferring it, and that the, original motion proposed
to contract a debt for something that has not been created yet.
We have not got an organization. But I hold that the delegates in
this convention, if they individually wish to pledge from their
individual purses a certain sum of money, they have a right to do
so, because they agree to do it at this specific time; but they
have no right to contract any debt for any people or person that
they represent here. Consequently I am in favor of the last
motion.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: All those in favor of deferring action on this
report until such time as the Constitution Committee shall have
reported, will signify by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is
carried.</p>
<h4>LITERATURE AND PRESS</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Committee on Literature and Press.</p>
<p>DEL. BRIMBLE: The first recommendation of this committee is
that this organization shall have an official organ, to be
published weekly. It was the sense of the Committee on Literature
and Press that the official organ be sent to the entire
membership, arrangements to be made for so doing. At 1.45 P. M.
yesterday we met and considered the resolution No. 11, presented
to the convention by Brother J. J. O&rsquo;Brien. It was moved
and seconded that we concur in the resolution, but that at
present we see no way of carrying it out. The motion was carried.
It was also suggested by the committee that Simons and
O&rsquo;Neil prepare an address to the workers on industrial
unionism; that Smith and Kiemensic prepare a leaflet on the
political aspect of the union; and that Brimble and Mrs. Forberg
prepare an indictment of the new trades unionism against the
old.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Committee on Literature and Press will
report progress.</p>
<h4>ORGANIZATION</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Committee on Organization.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: The recommendation of the committee is
that the matter of Resolution No. 7, which pertains to
organization on industrial lines with absolute home rule in the
State, etc., introduced by Brother Fairgrieve, of Montana, be
referred to the Committee on Constitution. That is all that the
committee has to report this morning.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move to concur in the report of the committee.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>Announcement was made that the Committee on Label and Emblem
had no report to make, but would meet on adjournment of the
present session.</p>
<h4>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</h4>
<p>Secretary Trautmann read the following resolution:</p>
<p>RESOLUTION No. 16.</p>
<p>Whereas, There is already established an international bureau
of those industrial unions which are based upon the class
struggle, with the headquarters at Berlin; therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That this new organization enter into immediate
relations therewith.</p>
<p>(Submitted by W. E. Trautmann, Thos. J. Hagerty and Daniel De
Leon.)</p>
<h4>RESOLUTIONS</h4>
<p>The Secretary read the following resolution, submitted by
Delegate Chas. Kiehn, representing the Longshoremen&rsquo;s Union
of Hoboken, N. J., in regard to the struggle of the people in
Russia:</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 17</h4>
<p>Whereas, There is in progress at the present time a mighty
struggle of the laboring class of far-off Russia against
unbearable outrage, oppression and cruelty and for more humane
conditions for the working class of that country; and</p>
<p>Whereas, The outcome of that struggle is of the utmost
consequence to the members of the working class of all countries
in their struggle for their emancipation; and</p>
<p>Whereas, This convention is assembled for the purpose of
organizing the working class of America into an organization that
will enable them to shake off the yoke of capitalist oppression;
now, therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That we, the industrial unionists of America in
convention assembled, urge our Russian fellow-workmen on in their
struggle, and express our heartfelt sympathy with the victims of
outrage, oppression and cruelty, and pledge our moral support and
promise financial assistance as much as lies within our power to
our persecuted, struggling and suffering comrades in far-off
Russia.</p>
<p>(By Chas. Kiehn, Longshoremen&rsquo;s Union, Hoboken, N.
J.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution with reference to establishing an
international bureau of industrial unions will be referred to the
Committee on Organization. The resolution just read, in regard to
the situation in Russia, will be referred to the Committee on
Resolutions.</p>
<p>The following resolution, submitted by Delegate Chas. Kiehn,
of Hoboken, N. J., was read by the Secretary:</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 18</h4>
<p>Whereas, The industrial union movement has for its object the
uniting of the working class of the world into one large and
powerful international organization, and for that purpose it is
necessary to at first create mutual relations with the labor
organizations of other countries ; therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That the incoming General Executive Board be
instructed to get in immediate communication with the
international secretaries of the trades and labor unions located
in Berlin, Germany, S.O. 16, Engel-Ufer 15, immediately after the
close of this convention, for the purpose of starting such mutual
relations as are necessary.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution will be referred to the Committee
on Organization.</p>
<p>The Secretary read the following resolution, offered by
Delegate Chas. Kiehn, of Hoboken, N. J.:</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 19</h4>
<p>Whereas, For the purpose of unifying and strengthening the new
organization it is necessary to have a uniform system of dues and
tax collection; therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That for the purpose of collecting dues and general
assessments stamps be issued by the general organization through
its duly elected officers ; that the stamp be put upon the books
as a per capita tax; that the same stamp be issued by the various
departments to the members thereof, and the proceeds be used for
the creation of a general fund.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be referred to the Committee on
Constitution. Are there any other resolutions?</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION NO. 20</h4>
<p>Resolution offered by Joseph Corna and A. Klemensic:</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the present form of capitalism is
increasing organized violence to perpetuate the spirit of
despotism to predominate in this republic ; be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That we condemn militarism in all its forms and
functions, which are jeopardizing our constitutional rights and
privileges in the struggle between capital and labor. Be it
further</p>
<p>Resolved, That any members accepting salaried positions to
defend capitalism, directly or indirectly, should be denied the
privilege of membership in this organization.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution will be referred to the Committee
on Resolutions Are there any other resolutions? New business.</p>
<h4>RATIFICATION MEETING</h4>
<p>DELEGATE T. J. HAGERTY: Under the head of new business should
come, I think, the resolution offered here calling for the
appointment of a committee to make arrangements for a
ratification meeting to be held not later than July 7th, so that
the representatives of the various organizations here might
publicly express their adherence to this new organization, and
that to the public at large might be given an expression of the
attitude of the men who stand for this economic organization. If
that is to be done it must be done soon, for many of the members
will be unable to remain any longer than July 7th. I think the
arrangements for such a meeting rightly come under the head of
new business.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution alluded to was referred to the
Committee on Ways and Means, and they have not reported. Is there
any further new business?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: It does not seem that there is any other business
coming before the convention, and as it is highly important that
we let the Constitution Committee go back to work, I move you
that we now adjourn until nine o&rsquo;clock Monday morning.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
this convention now stand adjourned until nine o&rsquo;clock
Monday morning. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: A point of information. As the Constitution
Committee is not able to state when it will be able to report to
this convention on the constitution, I would like to ask if it is
not in a position to make a report upon the preamble or
declaration of principles. That will lay the basis or express the
basis for this new organization, and its adoption will react upon
the other parts of the constitution. I would ask, if it is not in
a position to report at present, why not?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The brother asks if the Constitution Committee
has prepared the preamble or declaration of principles. Will the
chairman or some member of the committee answer?</p>
<p>DEL. MEYER: The sub-committee appointed by the Committee on
Constitution has not as yet completed its work on the preamble.
When they will complete the preamble can best be answered by
Brother Sullivan, of the Committee on Preamble, the sub-committee
from the Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Will Brother Sullivan state whether or not the
sub-committee is ready to report on the Preamble?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: We are not ready to report at this time. We
have part of the work done, but not a sufficient amount to be
submitted to this convention for their consideration.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Constitution Committee state that they are
not ready to report. The motion is to adjourn until nine
o&rsquo;clock Monday morning morning.</p>
<p>Del. Klemensic made an announcement in regard to delegates
visiting the graves of the Chicago martyrs in Waldheim
Cemetery.</p>
<p>A motion was made and seconded to amend the motion to adjourn
by making it nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow (Sunday instead of
Monday morning.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just a moment. Are there any other
announcements?</p>
<p>A number of announcements were made in regard to meetings of
the various committees.</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: A point of information. Delegate Hagerty made an
inquiry in regard to a mass meeting not later than the 7th of the
present month to ratify the work of this convention. That
resolution he informed the delegates is in the hands of the Ways
and Means Committee, and the point of information I rise to ask
about is, after hearing several discussions as to our power to
levy any assessment, have we got any different way of providing
ways and means for that meeting? As a member of the Ways and
Means Committee I ask for that information.</p>
<p>DEL. M. P. HAGGERTY: I wish to speak on the amendment relative
to having a Sunday session, when the time comes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion to adjourn is not debatable. The
question as to the time may be discussed.</p>
<p>DEL. M. P. HAGGERTY: I am opposed to Sunday sessions. I care
not how you recognize Sunday, whether you go to church or stay
away, but there is one thing we should do here, and that is
recognize Sunday as a day of rest. And I see no good in meeting
on Sunday, when we can adjourn on Thursday or adjourn on Friday.
Now let us observe Sunday as a day of rest at least. We are not
in such a great hurry that we need to take Sunday for labor. We
should have that one day in the week. We should certainly raise a
great outcry if the capitalist class insisted upon us working on
Sundays as well as the other six days. That would be seven-day
exploitation of us. Let us have Sunday as a day of rest at least.
I hope this motion will not prevail.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I believe we should not meet on Sunday.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment to the motion is that we meet
to-morrow morning at nine o&rsquo;clock. Those in
favor&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I want to make a further statement as chairman of
the Committee on Constitution. I ask whether or not Brother
Shurtleff has been appointed on the Constitution Committee and
will be allowed to sit unless appointed by the convention.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Shurtleff has not been appointed to the
Constitution Committee. The motion was that the delegation select
a member to work on that committee.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: Why not submit it to the convention, so that it
can be acted on before adjournment? Suppose we adjourn till
Monday morning at ten o&rsquo;clock. While I am on the floor I
want to say to the convention that the Constitution Committee at
its last session permitted the chairman to fill out the committee
in case they did not report at this day&rsquo;s session. We feel
that we should have a full Committee on Constitution and not fail
to report, so we ask the convention to permit the Chairman to
fill out that committee so that we may work this afternoon and
evening and tomorrow so as to be able if possible to make a
report to this convention Monday morning.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I desire information. The rules under which we
work authorize the various groups to appoint their
representatives on the various committees. My group appointed
Thomas Powers, but Powers has been taken sick and is lying in
bed, and my group has appointed me as a substitute. I desire to
know whether Brother Moyer would consider me entitled to sit on
that committee, and if he does not, whether this convention
should pass on that.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I did not hear you.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: The question that was asked with regard to
Delegate Shurtleff raises a doubt in my mind whether you would
recognize me as entitled to a seat on your committee, since our
group originally appointed Delegate Powers. Now, Delegate Powers
has been taken sick and my group has appointed me as his
substitute.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I believe that the convention has acted on your
appointment.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: All right. I simply put the question.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: The convention acted on the appointment as they
have on the appointment of other members of this committee.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Then has the convention acted on my
appointment?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes. I would ask that the International Musical
Union make their appointment before the adjournment of the
convention.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: That raises a point. Has the International
Musical Union been seated or recognized in this convention?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I think not, only inasmuch as it is recognized
as a part of the American Labor Union.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then that is satisfactory. I wanted to make it
clear I haven&rsquo;t any objection particularly to anybody going
on these committees, not a single solitary soul, if any
organization wants to be recognized that has not been recognized
particularly by this convention. I have not heard any credentials
read here from the International Musical organization. I rather
think, however, I remember that a musical organization from
Chicago has been given one vote. That is not a group. They simply
come under the individual organizations.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The International Musical Union is not here as
an organization prepared to install, but only as a component part
of the American Labor Union. It has no individual representation
on that committee except through the American Labor Union
group.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Is there any doubt that that is the only way it
is here?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I presume that is the way.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: The Secretary, I presume, must have a record.
Isn&rsquo;t it true that that is the way?</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Yes, that is true.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then there is no question about it.</p>
<p>The amendment to adjourn until Sunday morning was lost, and
the convention then adjourned until Monday morning at nine
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
