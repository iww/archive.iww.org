<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>ELEVENTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Saturday, July 8</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>Owing to the slowness of the delegates in gathering, the
convention was not called to order until shortly before nine
o&rsquo;clock A. M.</p>
<p>The minutes not being present at the opening, the reading of
the minutes of the previous day&rsquo;s proceedings was
postponed.</p>
<p>On motion the roll call of delegates was dispensed with.
Communications were called for, but there were none to be brought
before the convention.</p>
<p>The Credential Committee announced that it had no further
report to make.</p>
<p>Special committees were called for.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Under the head of special committees, I will say
that we are $5 short on the expenses of the meeting last night.
The meeting altogether cost $20. We only succeeded in raising
$15, and $5 has got to be made up here.</p>
<p>DEL. JOHNSON: I suggest that the same committee that took up
the collection yesterday take up another collection to make up
the deficiency; that is, after the bulk of the delegates come in.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>The Committees on Constitution and Resolutions announced that
they had no further reports.</p>
<h4>LITERATURE AND PRESS COMMITTEE.</h4>
<p>The Committee on Literature and Press, through Delegate Pat
O&rsquo;Neil, submitted the following report:</p>
<h4>TO ALL WORKING PEOPLE.</h4>
<p>Old as the story of wealth is the story of oppression, and
that oppression has always been leveled at, and heaped upon those
who have produced all the wealth&mdash;the laboring class.</p>
<p>To-day the warfare of the struggle between the classes is as
merciless, fierce and bloodthirsty as it ever was in the
past.</p>
<p>Your employer may be personally your friend. He may be a man
of the best intentions, and really desire to better the condition
of those he employs. But when his competitor cuts wages, he in
turn must cut yours or go out of business.</p>
<p>This is the iron law of business, the law of competition, and
the class struggle.</p>
<p>Can you not see the futility, therefore, of fighting
individual employers ?</p>
<p>The whole method must be swept away, until in the hands of the
laboring class rests the control of the tools of production and
distribution.</p>
<p>For this, the most important of all questions, insists upon
being answered, and must be answered without evasion.</p>
<p>Who are entitled to the ownership and control of the
industries? Those who perform the labor and produce the wealth;
or, those who produce nothing yet claim ownership after
production, because they have permitted part of your product to
return to you in the form of wages?</p>
<p>The natural law of labor and wages, as laid down by all the
great authorities, beginning with: &ldquo;In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread,&rdquo; is that the result of labor
belongs to that one who performs the labor. Thus the ownership is
by right of labor alone.</p>
<p>Naturally, then, follows this question: Who shall fix the
wages? Those who labor with the machines of production and
distribution, or those who laboring not at all, demand a portion
of the product?</p>
<p>Many men who claim to be our friends tell us there is a
harmony and identity of interest between the laboring and the
master class. Let us see. You are interested in getting the
largest possible returns for your labor. The master is interested
in getting your labor for the smallest wages.</p>
<p>Can you imagine harmony or identity of interest here?</p>
<p>This industrial union has been brought into existence because
those who organized it recognized there could be neither harmony
nor identity of interest, but instead, a never-ending and
merciless conflict, until the wage system is swept away.</p>
<p>This organization has come into the field for the purpose of
giving you a weapon with which to wage a contest for better
returns for your labor than you now enjoy, and that in all
conflicts you can offer an unbroken front of all labor to your
enemy,&mdash;the master class.</p>
<p>Also by becoming members of this organization you do your part
toward bringing into life and action a solidified workers&rsquo;
union, &mdash;a union that, recognizing the solidarity of the
working class, unites instead of dividing the workers.</p>
<p>All the efforts of labor organizations of the past have been
directed toward benefiting a few of the laboring class.</p>
<p>Just the skilled workmen of the various trades, as cigar
makers, carpenters, engineers, etc.</p>
<p>And after these men have joined their various unions, they
seem to feel they have become of another class than their fellow
workers, and seem to think those fellow workers are not entitled
to the same treatment, conditions and pay as they demand for
themselves.</p>
<p>The industrial union, however, offers to all the workers the
same advantages the older organizations offer to only a favored
few.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the common laborer is as valuable to society
as the most skillful mechanic, we offer to him the same shelter,
the same assistance and the same comradeship the older unions
offer to only a few tradesmen.</p>
<p>In the past, these bodies of union men have been kept divided
and at enmity by leaders who either ignorantly or willfully
assassinate the welfare of their followers for the benefit of the
master class. By these divisions and the strife, thus brought
about, these unions have wasted upon each other the strength
which should have been expended against the common enemy.</p>
<p>But the industrial union, embracing all workers, gives no
opportunity for craft conflict, nor can unscrupulous leaders
embroil the branches in wrangles over trade autonomy.</p>
<p>A uniform label for all products of union labor makes
impossible wrangling between trades over their labels. It will
end corrupt bargaining between capitalists and labor officials to
further the label of one group of workers above that of
another.</p>
<p>Such a union label is truly a weapon of defense for the
workers; instead of an advertisement for favored manufacturers
and to assist in the formation of monopolies to further oppress
working class purchasers.</p>
<p>Divided in resources and fighting strength as are the forces
within the present unions, nearly every strife becomes a battle,
not between laborers and capitalists, but between different
divisions of the working class.</p>
<p>But the industrial union concentrates all its force upon any
one point, financially or any other way.</p>
<p>It is the business and duty of the industrial union to wipe
out all imaginary boundary lines or divisions between the workers
by bringing them within the lines surrounding all the workers in
this and other countries.</p>
<p>Neither must a worker serve an apprenticeship to man or
machine, nor &ldquo;stand and deliver&rdquo; an enormous
initiation fee to become a member of this union.</p>
<p>In this industrial union there is room for and no bar against
any worker on account of race, sex, creed or color, and an
earnest invitation is extended to every worker to enroll him or
herself a member of this union.</p>
<p>At the time craft unions were organized trades were of
importance, and individual employers were the rule. Inventions
and developments upon the industrial field have wiped out the
trades. Craft unions have refused to keep up with the progress of
economics. They have served their time. Their usefulness has
ended, and they are to-day only deadweights on the forward
movement.</p>
<p>Would you not think a nation foolish that would go to war with
bows and arrows against machine guns. Yet that is the condition
of the trades unions to-day on the industrial field, its members
rushing unarmed and divided to do battle with a unified,
disciplined and merciless employing class.</p>
<p>Divided into small crafts they are helpless, for many crafts
are employed in one industry.</p>
<p>Betrayed by their leaders, these crafts are led singly to
battle and destruction, for all other crafts of that industry
assist the master in crushing their brothers. Just think how easy
it is done.</p>
<p>Union hod carriers go on strike, and union bricklayers carry
brick and mortar for themselves.</p>
<p>Union coal miners strike. Union railroad men haul scabs to the
mines and scab coal away from the mines.</p>
<p>Officials of the miners&rsquo; union order members of that
union to unload machinery loaded by scab teamsters.</p>
<p>We recognize that injury to one is injury to all, and that the
workers should be organized as a whole; thus avoiding such
treason among themselves.</p>
<p>In this way only an entire industry becomes a branch of the
organization, and the day of craft troubles will disappear.</p>
<p>For the uniform union label will mean uniform union conditions
to all.</p>
<p>And when you join any union, your card is good in any other
union without another initiation fee.</p>
<p>We see that the defeats of the past that have met us at every
turn were only because of our lack of unity.</p>
<p>For these reasons this organization has come into being. We
earnestly entreat you to enroll yourself with us.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the report of the Committee on
Literature and Press. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: I move its adoption.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I move that it be turned over to the incoming
Executive Board. (Seconded).</p>
<p>Motion put and carried, and report referred to the Executive
Board.</p>
<h4>EXPENSES OF PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE AND CONVENTION.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Has the Ways and Means Committee any further
report to make?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Yes. The Committee on Ways and Means recommend that
this convention assume the indebtedness contracted by the
convention, and further, that the matter be referred to the
incoming Executive Board.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is that the Conference?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: All preliminary financial transactions; that is
what it is meant for.</p>
<p>Del. Pat O&rsquo;Neil moved the adoption of the report. Motion
seconded by Delegate A. W. Morrow.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is it to be understood from this report of the
Ways and Means Committee that they recommend that the Industrial
Workers of the World assume the indebtdedness that was incurred
during the preliminary work of the Industrial Conference?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Yes. I want to make an explanation, that I would
like to have the Chairman of the committee here to explain the
situation. I did not write out the report myself, and this was
presented to me by the Chairman to read out, so that I would like
to have him make the explanation or explain the situation so that
there will be no misunderstanding about it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is the Secretary of the Ways and Means Committee
present?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: The Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. MCCABE: I don&rsquo;t think the Chairman is here just
now. That was his understanding; that was the understanding of
the committee, that this report should be made out with the
understanding that we assume the indebtdedness of the original
committee, the preliminary work for this convention.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Does this include the work and the indebtedness
contracted by this convention?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Yes.</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<h4>RITUAL COMMITTEE.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Have the Committee on Ritual prepared their
report?</p>
<p>DEL. MILLER: As a member of the Committee on Ritual, I will
state that we finished up to the installation ceremony last
night, but the committee has had no meeting this morning. I got
here at eight o&rsquo;clock and saw one or two members of the
committee, but no more.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move that the report of the Ritual Committee be
accepted and referred to the incoming Executive Board.
(Seconded).</p>
<p>Motion put and carried.</p>
<h4>COMMITTEE ON ORGANIZATION.</h4>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MACDONALD: The Committee on Organization desire to
submit the following: Your committee realize that the subject
referred to them is of vast importance to the growth and welfare
of this organization, and under the circumstances we gladly offer
certain recommendations as our judgment would best prompt. We,
further realize that the suggestions that we offer will involve
the expenditure of money, and the organization is without funds,
and that many demands will be made upon it in the near future.
Under these conditions we believe the interests of the
organization can best be served by refraining from imposing a
burden of instructions prior to the provisions being made for
carrying out the same. We therefore recommend that the matter of
organization for the ensuing term be left in the hands of the
Executive Board, with full power to act.</p>
<p>(The report was signed by Delegates McDonald, Baker, Mother
Jones, Bradley, Fitzpatrick and Hopkins).</p>
<p>On motion of Delegate Dinger the report was adopted.</p>
<p>The Committee on Label and Emblem, being called on, announced
no report.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Any unfinished business? New business.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION.</h4>
<p>Secretary Trautmann read the following resolution:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The delegates to this convention from the International
Painters&rsquo; Union of America, Local 359, would advise every
member of this organization to recognize that it is his privilege
as an American citizen to have weapons in his possession, and
they should use them when the capitalists force us to use
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Submitted by Delegate Samuel).</p>
<p>Delegate Dinger moved that the resolution be laid on the
table. (Seconded).</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair does not entertain the resolution, as
we are not under that order of business at this time. This will
not appear in the minutes of the convention until it comes under
the proper head.</p>
<h4>INSTALLATION OF ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The installation of Organizations. The
representatives of the different local unions, international
unions and individual members who are to take part in this new
movement will so announce by rising to their feet.</p>
<p>The respective representatives and individuals rose.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Individuals, all who take part in this new
movement, either representing themselves, their local unions or
other national bodies.</p>
<p>The delegates rose almost unanimously.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I, as Chairman, hereby duly install the
respective individuals and the representatives of the local
unions as a part of the Industrial Workers of the World.
(Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I desire to know if those who did not
stand did not participate in becoming a part of this
organization. In other words, Mr. Chairman, I want to know if
those who did not install themselves and did not participate in
installing their organizations at this time, shall have a voice
or a vote in this organization from this time on.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Those who have not become installed have neither
a voice nor a vote from this time on.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: I believe it would be well to have a record of
those.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: To make a record of the delegates, or of those
present?</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: To make a record of those who have installed
themselves in the organization. Several delegates representing
organizations with instructions to install did not rise or
participate in the installation.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will read the roll call and
proceed to make a record of the delegates and their organizations
that have been installed.</p>
<h4>ROLL CALL ON INSTALLATION.</h4>
<p>Secretary Trautmann then called the roll and took the answers,
as follows (dashes represent no response):</p>
<p>Western Federation of Miners&mdash;W. D. Haywood, yes. Charles
H. Moyer, yes. Charles H. McKinnon. Albert Ryan&mdash;J. H.
Baker, yes.</p>
<p>Milling and Smeltermen&rsquo;s Union, Butte, Mont.&mdash;</p>
<p>Socialist Trade &amp; Labor Alliance&mdash;Duncan McEachren,
yes. August Gillhaus, yes. Samuel J. French,&mdash; Thomas J
Powers, yes. Thomas H. Jackson, yes. Paul Dinger, yes. Theodore
Bernine, H. J. Brimble,&mdash; John T. Remley,&mdash; Joseph
Scheidler, yes. Octave M. Held, yes. Daniel De Leon, yes. Carl U.
Starkenberg, yes. Walter Goss,&mdash; Max Eisenberg, yes.
(Delegate Eisenberg requested to be called under the organization
to which he belonged.)</p>
<p>Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club, Cincinnati&mdash; Max
Eisenberg, yes.</p>
<p>Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club, Chicago&mdash; Thomas J.
Hagerty, yes. Robert Larson, yes. Mark Bartlett, yes. Bert
Sainer,&mdash; John E. McEachren, yes. Gus. Bartlett,&mdash; Mrs.
Bohlman,&mdash; Mrs. Isora Forberg,&mdash; Mrs. Lillian Forberg,
yes. Robert C. Goodwin,&mdash;Miss Libby Levinson, yes. M. B.
Quinn,&mdash;</p>
<p>W. J. Knight, Pueblo,&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Mr. Knight informed me as Secretary of the
Credential Committee that he had to leave, and he left a notice
for the brother from Illinois to act in his stead. He wants to
install his union, and left a written notice under his signature
to that effect, that he wanted to install his organization. He
left last night.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: That will be so recorded. The United Mine
Workers, Kansas, John Veal&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. GRAHAM: I wish to say that the peculiar circumstances
under which I was sent to this convention would not justify me,
in my opinion, just now in installing the men that appeared on my
credentials; for the reason that I belong to a big local of the
Federation of Miners and there were only a few, about 40 names,
given on my credentials, as men that were in favor of this
movement as far as they understood the movement. They sent me for
the purpose of finding out what this movement was; what were its
intentions and object; and I have to go back to them and take
them a report. Now, I feel that I would not be justified in
installing those men by voting &ldquo;yes;&rdquo; but on my own
account, and installing myself into the organization, I will vote
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roll was continued:</p>
<p>United Brotherhood of Railway Employees&mdash;J.
Fitzgerald&mdash;Thomas de Young, yes. E. T. Eastman&mdash; A. H.
Williamson&mdash; J. Churchfield&mdash; J. S. McDonald&mdash;
Frederick Dean&mdash; M. E. White, yes. Fred Hopkins, yes. Frank
McCabe, yes. William Hickey, yes. A. W. Morrow, yes. H. M.
Kyle&mdash; William Benning&mdash; Thomas Hansberry,&mdash; W. L.
Hall, yes. W. J. Bradley, yes. Fred Henion,&mdash; John
Plummer&mdash;</p>
<p>Montreal (Canada) Wage Earners&rsquo; Union&mdash; R. J.
Kerrigan&mdash; (The Secretary stated that Delegate Kerrigan was
absent, but was empowered.)</p>
<p>Punch Press Operators&rsquo; Union, Schenectady&mdash; J. W.
Roff&mdash;</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: I will state that Delegate Roff, before he
left, gave me authority to either write out or explain or
communicate to this convention that the Punch Press
Operators&rsquo; Union of Schenectady will install into this new
organization, and another statement by him was that somebody
should be sent to Schenectady in order to get the other
organizations installed into this new Industrial Workers of the
World. So I can report him &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; He gave me power to
report that way. .</p>
<p>(Roll call continued):</p>
<p>United Mine Workers, Red Mount, Montana&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I explained my position some time ago, and I
have seen no reason to change my views since.</p>
<p>Flat Janitors&rsquo; Local, Chicago&mdash; George U.
Miller&mdash; Andrew Anderson&mdash;</p>
<p>Journeyman Tailors&rsquo; Union, Pueblo, Col.,&mdash; A.
Klemnsic, yes.</p>
<p>United Metal Workers of America&mdash; Charles O.
Sherman&mdash; Charles Kirkpatrick&mdash;</p>
<p>Journeyman Tailors, San Francisco&mdash; George Nesbitt, yes.
American Labor Union&mdash; W. D. Haywood, yes. Daniel McDonald,
yes. William Shurtleff,&mdash; David C. Coates, yes. John
Riordan, yes. Henry S. Davis, no. Charles H. Moyer, yes. F. W.
Cronin, yes. Fred Clemens, yes. Clarence Smith, yes.</p>
<p>Cloakmakers and Custom Tailors&mdash;absent.</p>
<p>Charles O. Sherman, United Metal Workers,
&ldquo;here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I would like to ask the Secretary how he
recognizes him as voting.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: He answered &ldquo;here&rdquo; to the roll
call. He has not voted on the matter of installing the
organization in this industrial movement.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; (Applause.)</p>
<p>Roll call continued: John Beuchert, no. Longshoremen&rsquo;s
Union, Hoboken&mdash; Charles Kiehn&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: May I be permitted to explain my position? THE
CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I wish to explain to this convention that I was
sent here with no definite instructions, but since I have been
here I got instructions to install my organization on condition
that this organization shall not depart from the spirit of the
Manifesto. Since I have heard and know the constitution that has
been adopted, in my opinion it is not according to the spirit of
the Manifesto. In the first place, the plan of dividing the
industrial activities of society into craft unions, into thirteen
divisions, appears to me as the creation of craft lines.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: I enter an objection to a member making a speech on
explaining his vote.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: Can&rsquo;t I explain my position?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I think so. Yes, Brother Kiehn, we would like to
know your position.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: Another objection to the constitution is that it
gives the President or the Executive Board of this organization
czarish powers that are not given to the executive officers of
any other pure and simple organization in this country.
Practically we install ourselves in the hands of a few
individuals, In this particular I wish to pay my compliments to
the delegates of the Trades &amp; Labor Alliance, who, in my
opinion, have turned a complete somersault on the teachings and
the principles that they have been promulgating for the last ten
or fifteen years. It appears to me that the organization that has
been created by the constitution&mdash;whether only for a time or
whether it is forever does not matter&mdash;but it seems to me
that this organization is a second edition, but not an improved
edition, of the American Federation of Labor. I have been sent
here to assist in creating an organization that will be something
different from the American Federation of Labor, and since the
adoption of this constitution I have made up my mind that there
is no difference, excepting that it may be a little worse. It has
been left to the Executive Board, and we know by experience what
an Executive Board is; the Executive Board in interpreting the
constitution consists of the President and General Secretary; we
have always found that out, and the constitution they can stretch
as they please; it is a rubber band, and they can stretch it as
they please, and we are not, in my opinion, and the members that
I represent, to comply with the rules arbitrarily interpreted or
laid down by a few men. We wish to hold the organization to
ourselves, and that is why I take the stand that I will not
undertake to install any organization that I represent.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Not install?</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: Not install.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Now come the individuals. Mark Ord,&mdash; H.
Ferber, yes. M. Glasgow&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: Allow me to explain briefly. I have raised the
matter before the union that I belong to, with 1,700 members, and
after considerable discussion and opposition, and with the aid of
Brother Saunders, succeeded in having that union send five
fraternal delegates to this convention. Of course we have no
power in any manner to install here by initiating as an
organization or union into this convention. Individually I feel
this way: I represent that union in the Painters&rsquo; District
Council, and also in the Chicago Federation of Labor. I know that
if I become a member of this as an individual I will be denied
the privilege of representative in those two bodies. I also do
not know what position my own union may take, provided I become
an individual member. I feel that I can do more for the
industrial organization upon the lines which we have succeeded in
adopting by being able to attend those bodies and advocating the
principles whenever an opportunity may present itself, in such a
way that it will not debar me also in my own union. I therefore
feel that I must refrain from identifying myself with it as an
individual.</p>
<p>Roll call continued: J. J. Johnson&mdash; Robert Nelson&mdash;
J. W. Saunders&mdash; Otto Ulrich&mdash; Lincoln Wright, no. T.
J. Hitchings, no. F. P. Cranston&mdash; J. A. Sturgis&mdash;

Breckon&mdash; Lorenz Kleinherz&mdash; Michael Tracey&mdash;
Juile Mechanic&mdash; Joseph Clossy&mdash; Rosa Sullway&mdash; W.
C. Critchlow&mdash; Emma F. Langdon, yes. Theodore Rickey J.
Peuchert, as an individual, yes. Philip Veal&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. VEAL: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I wish to state
the position which the local holds that I represent. In that mine
there are 400 miners working. There are seven locals in the
United Mine Workers represented in this mine. The local I belong
to sent me here. It is known as the radical local, the Edgmont
local. Now, then, I know that I express the sentiments of those
men, that they would come in as far as that local is concerned,
but the moment that they would, these other men who are working
there would go and scab on them. Hence I am not going to take the
responsibility of saying that those men will come in, but as an
individual I am going to take the responsibility myself, and will
work; and I don&rsquo;t propose to bore from within either; we
are going to smash them from without. I want Mr. Wright, the
delegate from Local 99, who works in the same mine, to state
before this delegation the position that he is going to take when
he returns back and reports before the local.</p>
<p>Roll call continued: Philip Voegtle&mdash; Evan Evans&mdash;
J. Walker&mdash; John Green&mdash; Philip Veck&mdash; H. C.
Perry&mdash; Tom Burke&mdash; W. Thopham&mdash; Duncan
McDonald&mdash; W. D. Ryan&mdash; R. J. Robinson, yes. Fred
Shotak&mdash; J. Fox&mdash; Florence Basora&mdash; Joseph J.
O&rsquo;Brien&mdash; J. L. Fitts, yes. C. L. Spiegel, yes. L. L.
Thompson&mdash; W. F. Davis, yes. H. M. Richter&mdash; Gust.
Herwarth&mdash; J. W. Johnson, yes. Ben Frankford, yes. J. W.
Saunders&mdash; Charles Schoeller&mdash; James Smith, yes. Pat
O&rsquo;Neil, yes. C. W. Sunagel&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SUNAGEL: In the position I am in I cannot install the
organization I represent. They sent me to see the work done here.
Probably if they think the constitution is all right they will go
into the organization. If not they will not. Therefore I cannot
vote.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Individually how do you stand?</p>
<p>DEL. SUNAGEL: Individually I am in favor of the movement.</p>
<p>Roll call continued: R. M. Scutt, yes. C. F. Martin&mdash; W.
E. Scoggan, yes. Evan J. Dillon, yes. R. Sullivan&mdash; James
Murtaugh&mdash; J. C. Sullivan, individually yes. C. H.
Becker&mdash; Joy Pollard&mdash; Frank W. McCormick, individually
yes. W. F. Weber&mdash; Charles McKay, yes. A.
Jorgensen&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: As an individual yes, but as to my local I am
somewhat in the same position as the individual from the
Painters&rsquo; Local. Although I would like to say yes, I would
install myself individually in the new organization, but in
accordance with our instructions in our organization, and in
accordance with the ideas that I was sent here with, I do not see
that it would do any good for this organization to do anything
for a month or two in that body. If I can go back to the
organization and report the work of this new organization and its
proceedings they will see for themselves, and we may try to start
a club and work in the same way after as we started that local
when we first started twenty years ago. I think it will be more
beneficial to this organization if I remain silent after this. I
can assure you that the impression that I have got from this
organization, and also my colleague, Brother Thompson, is that
the only thing for the trade unionists and any other men that
toil on this earth for a living is to join a movement of this
kind. (Applause). Trade unions, the fighting sort that they have
in there, seem to be getting weak. That due book and due card
seems to be getting so weak that it is all riddled full of bullet
holes that have been shot in them whenever they have showed that
card and made any demands. Another card fifty times as big as the
card I carry in my pocket is the card of injunction that has been
posted on all the wagons of industry, so it seems to me that we
have got to have the ball opened and that weapon of the
industrial union for our organizations. I must criticize a member
or the members on this floor that will say that we don&rsquo;t
see that this organization will have more in its future for
organized labor than the American Federation of Labor. I will say
that the American Federation has only one good thing, and that is
this, that Gompers is a doctor who gives the members of that
organization a box of pills, and tells them to take one pill at a
time. The cover on that box is put on so tight that they
can&rsquo;t get the cover off the box.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: A point of order.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSON: I am about through. The tighter the cover on
the box, the longer the pills last.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: I object to his making a speech in explaining
his vote.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: Well, I am through.</p>
<p>Roll call continued: Pat O&rsquo;Neil, yes. J. A.
Ferguson&mdash; Thomas Schwartz&mdash; John Cren&mdash; Edward
Payment&mdash; John Brown&mdash; Luella Twining, yes. Charles
Hibbard&mdash; Edward Rody&mdash; Joseph Gilbert, yes. Ad. S.
Comm, yes. W. F. Morrison&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I simply want to ask for information this: I am
a member of the United Brotherhood of Railway Employes. Will it
be necessary at this time for me to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; as an
individual delegate on the floor?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It won&rsquo;t do any harm.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: Then I will say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; The only
reason was I did not want to go on and say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for
the organization:</p>
<p>Roll call continued: W. Tunningly&mdash; Bessie A.
Hanan&mdash; Mrs. E. C. Cogswell, yes. Albert S. Cogswell, yes.
C. C. Ross&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I only ask for a
moment. Being heartily in accord with every line and every word
of the Preamble of this organization, that is its platform, I
feel satisfied that any man who analyzes it will never be called
to task for the faithful performance of his duty as I heard our
worthy chairman Comrade Haywood and fellow delegate Brother
Sherman explain last night. As far as the constitution for
governing the organization is concerned, I am willing to leave
that to the wisdom of the Constitution Committee and to the
members of this organization, in the belief that if in time to
come it proves insufficient it will be amended; and accordingly I
vote &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; While I have the floor I want to call the
Secretary&rsquo;s attention to the roll call on the constitution
yesterday. He omitted my name and I was recorded as not voting,
whereas I voted &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: I called the name right upon the roll call. It
is the same roll call that I have got in my hand now.</p>
<p>Roll call continued: W. Harry Spears&mdash; E. Bosky&mdash; E.
J. Morrow&mdash; J. L. Schatzke&mdash; J. W. Ryan&mdash; Michael
Tracey&mdash; C. A. Payne&mdash;Joe Corna&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. CORNA: I desire to state that I am placed in a very
peculiar position, for the local that appointed me to represent
them here did not give me power to install them. As far as
joining this organization as an individual, I would be very glad
to take part in it if social conditions would permit me to pay
the dues in both organizations. That is something I cannot afford
to do at the present time, for we have been working about twelve
hours per week during the last three or four months.
Consequently, I am willing to use my best judgment and devote my
ability to propagate this new industrial movement, but at present
I do not know whether it would be advisable for me to become a
member or not.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Not voting?</p>
<p>DEL. CORNA: No; I vote &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roll call continued: A. Wrink&mdash; A. M. Simons, yes. E. V.
Debs, absent. Mother Jones, yes. W. E. Trautmann, yes. John
O&rsquo;Neil, absent. Carl Koechlin&mdash;</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: He left a letter with me before he left
empowering me individually to announce that he would become a
member of this organization.</p>
<p>Roll call continued: W. Roscoe Parks, yes. E. D.
Hammond&mdash;Marion Brown&mdash; R. D. Tobias&mdash; T.
Kleinman&mdash; Lucy E. Parsons&mdash; Charles Frey, no. T. N.
Ricke&mdash; W. V. Hardy&mdash; A. G. Ristol, yes. A. Kohn&mdash;
Anton Andra, no. J. D. Mack&mdash; John Matthews&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. S. J. FRENCH, NEW YORK, S. T. &amp; L. A.: S. J. French,
absent when called, asks to be recorded as present and ready to
install. So recorded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there any delegate in the hall who has not
heard his name announced?</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: Have you got my name? I want to go on record as
saying that I realize that by becoming a member of this
organization I will be made the target of every political and
labor fakir in the city of Milwaukee. I am prepared to stand
their shocks and go against them on the lines as laid down in the
Industrial Workers of the World. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SHURTLEFF: I would like to be recorded as voting
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. JOHNSON: I want to be recorded as voting
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: I was not here when my name was called. I would
like to be recorded as voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; Hopkins, of the
U. B. R. E.</p>
<p>DEL. SAINER: Delegate Sainer of the Industrial Club, Chicago,
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: I also. I would like to state that the
Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club, consisting of fifty-four members,
have instructed us to put all the members on that list. I have
the list ready and will send it to the Secretary.</p>
<p>DEL. G. M. YOUNG: I would like to be recorded as voting
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; from the Longshoremen, Detroit.</p>
<p>DEL. MILLER: I should like to he recorded as voting
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there any other delegate who has not heard
his name called, or who came in after his name was called? Those
delegates who came in after the installation will please rise to
their feet; any of the delegates who came in late.</p>
<p>Delegates Sherman, Kirkpatrick and French rose.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Sherman and Brother Kirkpatrick. Any
other delegate that has not been installed?</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: I had my name quietly recorded. I voted on my
position. I did not know about the installation; I was out.</p>
<p>The individuals ready to install rose.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brothers, as Chairman of the Industrial Workers
of the World, I hereby announce that you, as individuals and as
representatives of your respective locals and internationals, are
hereby duly installed as members and as parts of the Industrial
Workers of the World. (Applause). The next order of business is
the report of the Committee on Ways and Means.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Now, Mr. Chairman, I move you&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother De Leon, the special order of business
this morning is the election of officers.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: All right, sir.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The next order of business is the election of
officers. Nominations for President are in order.</p>
<h4>ELECTION OF OFFICERS.</h4>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I nominate Albert Ryan, of the Western
Federation of Miners, of Jerome, Arizona, as President. (Seconded
by Pat O&rsquo;Neil.)</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: I have in mind a member of this
convention, and a friend of labor and brother of mine, that I
desire to place before this convention. He is a man that requires
no recommendation and no introduction from me; a man who has been
associated with the labor movement for years; a man&mdash;</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I desire to know whether the brother voted to
install.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: What was the interruption?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: He asked whether you had voted, when your name
was called, to install.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I did not think I would be accused of that much
impudence. I desire to place before you for the favorable
consideration of this convention a man of determination; a man
who, though modest, is a man of force and activity; a man that
has been tried and stood the test; a man that has contributed as
much if not more than any other single individual in this
convention to the consummation of this organization; a man who,
in my judgment, will contribute as much if not more, in the next
year, to the success and growth and development and perpetuation
of this organization than any other individual or combination of
individuals could do; a man, I say, who is charitable, who is
kind, who is tender, who is extremely modest. I desire to place
this gentleman in the hands of this convention for your kind,
serious and favorable consideration Mr. Charles H. Moyer,
President of the Western Federation of Miners. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I want to thank Delegate McDonald for the
confidence he has expressed in me by nominating me as President
of the movement which we have just installed. But I want to say
to Brother McDonald that I fully appreciate the nomination, and
without making a speech at this time and without going into
details in regard to the reasons that I may give to this
convention, I will say that it is absolutely impossible for me to
accept the nomination. In declining the honor conferred I wish to
place in nomination a delegate in this convention in whom I have
the utmost confidence; a man who, I believe, if elected to lead
this movement which has just been launched, will not be found
wanting; a man who, I believe, is prepared at this time to go up
against the American Federation of Labor and fight it to the
finish that is going to be absolutely necessary; a man who I
believe has been instrumental in drawing, more than any one other
man, his organization away from the American Federation of Labor
in order that they might be installed as a part of the Industrial
Union; a man in whose hands I am willing to place my
organization, the Western Federation of Miners as a part of this
organization. I have the pleasure, and I believe I make no
mistake, in placing before this convention the name of Charles O.
Sherman as President.</p>
<p>DEL. GILLHAUS: I rise to second the nomination for the same
reasons given by Brother Moyer.</p>
<p>DEL. GUY MILLER: Briefly I rise to voice my own preference.
When one realizes that the battle is to be hard and bitter, one
wants to know that the man who is to lead that movement will
stand the hardest blows and be able to give as much as he
receives. The man whom I name is one who has the power to do and
the courage to dare in larger measure than any other man
identified with the labor movement in America. I name that
peerless Secretary-Treasurer of the Western Federation of Miners,
William D. Haywood. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I rise not to
make a nomination, but to second the nomination made by Guy E.
Miller. I second the nomination of the man who has acted as our
Chairman; a man whom I consider one of courage; a man whom I
think and I trust the capitalists of this country and of the
world will not point their fingers to with scorn, but a man who
will not be afraid to go to the bull-pen if necessary.</p>
<p>MOTHER JONES: And lick the militia.</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: Yes, and lick the militia. (Applause). I admired
his speech last night when he said that if he were a Negro he
would be worth $3,000, and I thought then that he was a priceless
jewel for labor. That is the opinion that I have formed of him
since we assembled here. I am not here for the purpose of
throwing bouquets. I am not here for the purpose of having my
little speech taken down by the stenographer. I am not here for
the purpose of seeing my name in print. But I am here as my
brother Wilke from Milwaukee said, to make a target of myself
also for capitalism. Since I have been here in this convention I
have lost my job. I make this declaration, as I made on the
Fourth of July, that from this time on, so help me God in heaven,
I shall make myself a target for capitalism, and I shall devote
every life-blood drop for the upbuilding and the emancipation of
labor. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. GILBERT: I am not going to take up much time, neither am
I going to make a nomination; but now that I have become a member
of this organization, although I do not represent any body of
workers, I do not consider it presumption on my part as an
individual to say a few words. Probably some of you here to-day
do not fully realize the work that we have done. Probably you do
not fully realize what a tremendous fight we are going up
against. I want to tell you, fellow delegates, that we are going
up against the greatest thing that has ever been, as you are
going to see the tragedy of the ages enacted if only we all do
our duty. Therefore, on the threshold of that fight we have got
to develop men in whom we all have absolute confidence. I am not
going to say that to cast any reflection upon any others; only I
will say this, that while there may be other men just as good as
one who has been nominated here to-day, that we have got to judge
a man by what he has done, and when we consider one of these men
who have been placed in nomination here to-day, we know that he
is made of material that will not flinch when the time comes
requiring a stout heart. We also know that he possesses the
utmost integrity of purpose. We also know that he possesses one
of the qualities I firmly believe in, and that is idealism. And
therefore this convention could not do a wiser thing than to make
the election of William D. Haywood unanimous. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: When we first heard of the Western Federation of
Miners, we knew that the man who now occupies the chair and whose
nomination I am going to second in a moment, possessed courage,
possessed those characteristics that made him feared and hated as
but one or two others, if any others in America, are feared and
hated by those who are our enemies and the enemies of our class.
I know personally, from the experience I have had with him in the
conference and on the committee in this convention, that he is a
man whose counsel is of value; a man who sees widely and clearly;
we know him to be a man who has sat in this convention largely
apart from the factions that may have arisen within it; and for
all those reasons, plain, practical but strong reasons, I want to
urge, as the gentleman who has just sat down, that we make his
election unanimous.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: Brothers and sisters, I realize the honor that
has been conferred upon me by being placed before this convention
as a candidate for the presidency of this organization; but it is
impossible for me to accept the nomination. I have but recently
left Salt Lake City, where the Western Federation of Miners held
their thirteenth annual convention, and was there re-elected as
Secretary-Treasurer of the Western Federation of Miners. I was
elected in good faith by the membership of that organization. I
accepted the office in good faith. When you stop to consider the
condition of other officers in other labor organizations that
have been involved in trouble, and think what it means to the
officers of that organization to have been re-elected, you will
understand where my duties lie at the present time. I want to
stay there with the Western Federation of Miners to fill out the
term for which I have been elected. In doing so I believe I can
assist the Industrial Workers of the World. You can depend upon
me at every turn in the road. You can crush me on the wheel, if
you will; I will do everything I can to carry my part of the
burden. But owing to the condition of my family making it
impossible&mdash;or rather I do not desire to be away from home
as much as an office of this kind would entail upon me. I cannot
move my family to where the headquarters are likely to be
located, and believing that that family is the first
consideration, I must decline the nomination.</p>
<p>DEL. ALBERT RYAN: I decline the nomination; I was downstairs
when I was nominated.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: I think we have men in this convention who are
willing to do what is right, who have undoubtedly shown their
ability in the labor movement and devoted their time to it. I
would like to mention here for nomination Comrade Coates. He has
been one of the staunch fighters for the last many years, and he
would do as good as anybody. (Applause. Nomination seconded.)</p>
<p>A Delegate moved that the nominations be closed. No
second.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I would like to ask, is Eugene V. Debs a member of
this organization?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Debs not having been duly installed, it
would occur to the Chair that he is not at this time regularly
installed.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: I would like to place in nomination Daniel De
Leon, of New York.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I decline. I beg to request the convention to
drop my name. I have other work to do for which I am better
fitted than to be the head of an organization of this nature. I
decline.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Charles O. Sherman and David C. Coates are
nominees. If there is no further nomination&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to kindly thank Delegate Klemensic for
this nomination, but I wish to say that I absolutely and
positively decline to be a candidate before this convention for
any position, President or in any other official capacity in this
organization at the present time.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I now move that the nominations be closed, and
there remaining but one nomination, that of Delegate Sherman,
that this convention make his nomination unanimous. (Motion
seconded by Delegate T. J. Hagerty.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the nominations be closed and that Delegate Sherman be declared
the unanimous choice of this convention for President. Are you
ready for the question? (Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: By a rising vote.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Those in favor of the motion will please rise to
their feet. (The entire convention arose). Those opposed. The
Secretary will cast the ballot of the convention for Delegate
Sherman.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Charles O. Sherman elected by unanimous vote
President of the Industrial Workers of the World.</p>
<p>(Applause and calls for Sherman.)</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman, Brothers and Sisters: As I never
was placed in a position of this kind before, it is difficult for
me to find words fitting for the occasion. I believe that this is
the first time in my life that I have been untrue to myself. For
the past six months I had resolved within myself and announced to
my friends and the world that I was serving my last official term
for labor, and I will assure you that the position that I am
placed in makes it so embarrassing that it is hard to find words
fitting for the occasion under those circumstances, and had it
not been for the many warm friends that I have had a great many
years in this movement and those that I have made in this
convention; had it not been for them bringing the pressure to
bear upon me that they did, I should certainly have declined this
most honorable election. I feel that I have been honored with the
greatest trust that any man was ever honored with in years
(applause), because I feel that no man was ever offered an
executive office or any position where the principles were
involved that are involved in the Industrial Workers of the
World. I feel that it was the greatest honor that could be
bestowed upon any man when the Western Federation of Miners laid
their vote at my feet, realizing as I did the vast material that
they have got in their organization that I feel is superior to
myself for a position of this kind; realizing the great education
that they have had, and when they absolutely refuted to furnish a
candidate and laid the force and the vote of that organization at
my feet, I felt that it was the greatest honor that could be
bestowed upon me. I trust, sisters and brothers, that you will
realize as keenly as I do the responsibility that you have put
upon me. As Mother Jones remarked, we are up against the real
thing. But I feel that if I get the same co-operation of the
sisters and brothers that there has been in this convention, if
they give the same co-operation to the administration of this
organization that they have to this convention, there will at the
next convention be plenty of candidates for the executive head of
this organization. (Applause). Because I feel that with the
assistance of those who are joining this organization at the
present time and those that will join between now and the next
convention, we are going to have an industrial organization
second to none in the world. I realize too keenly that there will
not be one moment of quietude, there will not be one moment but
what there will be a contest or fight on somewhere, but I will
say to you, brothers, that as long as there is one drop of blood
left in my body, if my constituents will stand by me they will
find me on the battle line supporting the banner. (Applause). If
we do not succeed, it will not be because we will recede from the
position, but because we will be crushed. We will succeed or they
must kill us. (Applause). The watchword must be, &ldquo;There is
no defeat. We must and will win.&rdquo; (Applause). I hope and
trust, as I said before, that every sister and brother, whether
he or she may be close to the President of this organization or
in other parts, that they will remember their obligation to the
organization, that they will constitute themselves an
organization, and if they do I am confident that we will win. As
President of your organization I feel that it is my duty to carry
out the laws of the constitution that you have adopted in this
convention. I will exercise my right as given to me in those
laws, and try to administer those laws and rules in a way that
will be satisfactory to all who have endorsed this constitution.
It will be the height of my ambition to see our organization
grow, and our treasury, so that we can at as early a date as
possible institute an educational bureau whereby we can reach
with literature those who need education, and enlighten them on
this work and upon the principles of industrial unionism based
upon the class struggle. I will feel that it is my duty to look
after all these things that we have pledged ourselves to do in
the way of resolutions and in the way of the constitution, and do
such other work as I believe will be the making of the
organization. Now, I say, sisters and brothers, that I am opposed
to having any office, whether it be the industrial or a political
organization. I feel that I am now only your hired man and your
servant, and I will try to conduct myself in that way; and I say
to you that it is not the time to receive any applause or brass
bands, but wait till my office has expired, and then if my work
shows that it is worthy of a brass band or applause, then it is
up to you to say whether I receive them or not. (Applause). If I
deliver the goods along with the constituents and the membership,
then we will join hands and feel that we unitedly are entitled to
praise. I thank you most sincerely. (Applause.)</p>
<p>President Sherman was then called before Chairman Haywood, to
be installed.</p>
<p>CHAIRMAN HAYWOOD: President Sherman, the Ritual Committee,
have prepared a pledge. &ldquo;You have been selected by the
members of this organization to assume the responsibilities of
office. The place of difficulty and danger is the post of honor.
It is neither to be sought nor shunned. All that the world has
gained is the gift of the toilers. They stand with empty hands,
but they are coming to claim their own. It is your duty to carry
out the policies that will best defend their interests. Your
devotion and courage will hasten the day when those who have
known only toil and gloom shall enjoy the sunshine and the beauty
of the world. Let neither praise nor slander take you from the
path of duty. The measure of your service will be the measure of
our love. Guard well the interests confided to your
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>President Sherman then assumed the duties of President, amid
applause.</p>
<p>PRESIDENT SHERMAN: Sisters and Brothers, I subscribe to the
charge in full, and will, to the very best of my ability, carry
them out to the letter. I would like to say, however, that a
remark was made here on the floor of this convention that the
American Federation of Labor was going to be one of our
opponents. My position would be this: that in any open fight or
battle or battles that they wish to challenge us to, if they will
come in the open and discuss the proposition we are willing to
leave the decision to the rank and file. (Applause). I believe
the next order of business will be the nomination and election of
a General Secretary-Treasurer.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Mr. Chairman, I desire to place in nomination for
this responsible office a man whom I know personally, and whom
the world knows to have made a great personal sacrifice for the
industrial union movement at a time when he had no encouragement
to do so; a man who has asked for nothing; a man who has taken
upon himself the work of furthering this movement without any
idea of personal gain. I am satisfied that when I mention the
name of the person whom I wish to place in nomination there is
not a person in the United States who has kept himself familiar
with the labor movement but will say with me that he stands
almost peerless in the way of a personal sacrifice to the
interests of the working people, and that man is William E.
Trautmann, of Cincinnati. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: In seconding the nomination of William E.
Trautmann I would say that from the time of the issuance of this
Manifesto the entire power of the machinery of the American
Federation of Labor was brought to bear upon William Ernest
Trautmann; that his organization, the United Brewery Workers,
although voting overwhelmingly to retain him in his position as
the editor of the &ldquo;Brauer Zeitung,&rdquo; was itself
cheated out of the services of Brother Trautmann by the casting
of fraudulent ballots against him; that as editor of the
&ldquo;Brauer Zeitung&rdquo; he was in the fore front of the
radical labor movement of the world, and by reason of his
intimate familiarity with the labor movement not only of America,
but of all continental Europe, by reason of his personal
relations with the secretary of the International Labor Bureau at
Berlin, of his personal relations with Emilio Pauget of France,
of his personal relations with the labor movement of Italy, of
Denmark and of Germany, he is known not only in this country as a
man absolutely familiar with the revolutionary economic spirit of
the world-wide working class, but his name is not unknown in
foreign lands, where he is recognized as standing by the
principles of the Industrial Workers of the World. And I move
you, if it is not out of order, in seconding this nomination,
that his election be made by acclamation of this entire congress
here. (Applause.)</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: I will rule that at this time the motion would
be out of order. Any other nominations?</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: In view of what has been said I rise to second
the nomination that is now before this body. In the labors that
have been performed by our worthy brother, W. E. Trautmann, I
desire to say this: To my mind, the power and the integrity and
the wisdom that he has displayed in his every-day life and in his
connection with this movement from its incipiency do not in any
degree reveal to me the character of a weak stream which searches
out some little channel in which to wind its fickle and sickly
course. And again, my brothers, they do not remind me of the
headlong torrent which carries havoc in its mad career. But his
every act and his ability resemble, to me, the mighty ocean which
this organization must manifest to the world; an unceasing power,
ever restless upon its bed, heaving the mighty waters to the
shore. And, my brothers and sisters, he to-day represents that
particular emblem of majestic power. And as a mighty ocean, this
man and this movement identified together will prove their power
and their efficiency by their common action. I believe W. E.
Trautmann represents to this organization the individual who
should administer the affairs of this office and to the best
interests of this organization. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I have known Brother Trautmann since last
September only, but since last January I have been intimately
associated with him in the work of the Executive Committee that
has prepared for this convention. I want to say, Mr. Chairman,
that in my opinion there are two requirements for an official
position in this organization. One of them, which is the less of
the two in my opinion, is perfect familiarity with the work with
which he has to contend or meet, and the other, which is the most
important of all, is the willingness to meet any test to which he
may be put. I believe that the members of this organization,
particularly the members of the Executive Board and its officers,
are going to be placed in a position where, if they perform their
work properly, they will be the target, not for the American
Federation, as has been referred to on this floor, so much as the
target for the capitalist class. And I want to say, Mr. Chairman,
that in my judgment the fight of the capitalist class in Colorado
against the Western Federation of Miners will, by the side of
this that we are approaching, be the mere skirmish, and this is
to be the battle. I believe that when men are to place
particularly their lives in the hands of other men, we should
have men who can be absolutely trusted with the lives of those
men with whom they are associated. I do not know any other man
with whom I would care to place my life if I were to be
associated with this movement, than William E. Trautmann, the man
who has been nominated. (Applause). I move you that the
nominations now be closed and that the President cast the ballot
of this association for William E. Trautmann as the unanimous
choice of this organization for Secretary-Treasurer of the
Industrial Workers of the World. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I rise to second the motion; and I will say on
the nomination of Brother Trautmann, that the people I represent
here are familiar with the name of Comrade Trautmann. We know
that he is one of the pioneers of this movement. We know also of
the great sacrifices he has made, and I know also of the work
that he has done in this convention, and the hardly
comprehensible amount of work which he has done in the launching
of this organization. It is hardly conceivable to me how a man
could go through all the work which he has gone through since
this movement took its initiative step. I think, also, comrades,
that when the workingmen of America have an opportunity to see
the typical workingman represented by Comrade Trautmann, and to
know by his speech and by his actions that he is the real
every-day workingman, the man who has got the education necessary
as a worker and all that sort of thing they will feel that the
work of this organization is in the hands of the right man. Now,
comrades, I do not feel equal to the emergency; I do not feel
equal to the task of giving Comrade Trautmann the credit which
properly belongs to him, but I heartily endorse on behalf of the
Socialist Trade &amp; Labor Alliance and heartily second the
motion of the comrade to close the nominations and make the
election of Comrade Trautmann unanimous. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I am not
rising to place in nomination a new candidate, but I am simply
here for the purpose of giving my second to the nomination
already made. This is not because I agree with him politically
and that I am affiliated in the same craft, but it is because we
meet on the same economic field; that is why I second the
nomination.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: Mr. Chairman and Delegates: Considerable stress
has been laid on the fact that some of the nominees that have
been mentioned have received the support of the Western
Federation of Miners. I take this opportunity of seconding the
nomination of Brother Trautmann, and assuring him, believing that
I voice the sentiments of the representatives of the Western
Federation of Miners, of our entire support. We will render every
assistance to himself and the President in carrying out the work
of this organization, and we will expect him to give us full
returns. (Applause.)</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the nominations now close and that we make Brother
Trautmann&rsquo;s election unanimous. Those that are in favor of
the motion will signify the same by rising to their feet. (The
entire convention rose, amid applause). I will instruct the
Assistant Secretary to cast one ballot for Brother Trautmann.</p>
<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY LANGDON: I hereby cast my ballot as the
unanimous choice of this organization as Secretary-Treasurer for
W. E. Trautmann.</p>
<p>(Calls for Secretary Trautmann.)</p>
<p>SECRETARY TRAUTMANN: My comrades, in the early days of my
life, confronted by the conditions of being raised from the slums
of this proletarians of the world, I have known the class
conflict on all its sides in every part of the world, and I was
made by cruel conditions a slave, but a class conscious slave of
the working class. In Russia, when the first lashings were
administered to me in the same city where to-day the revolution
arises, from that day I have become, not by the mere study of the
works of the economists, not by a study of the conditions as they
are shown in the books, but by the cruel, barbarous conditions
under which my class has been evolved, I have become a class
conscious wage worker and a wage slave. (Applause). Driven from
one part of the world to another: born in a country which is
considered to be free, in New Zealand; my father himself being a
miner and crushed to death in the mines; from that day on my
family was separated and I became a victim of the present system,
and as a victim I became a warrior against the conditions that
have made me a victim. (Applause). I came to this country, where
my father was a citizen until he was forced to emigrate to New
Zealand. When I entered upon the shores of this country, I found
the same conditions prevailing as I found over in Russia, in
Germany, in all the countries of the world wherever I had a
chance to travel as a wage earner. I was a member of the United
Brewery Workers, an organization of which I am proud because the
rank and file are in it. When a member of that organization that
to-day stands foremost in all the battles of the wage earners of
this country, I went through all the struggles with them and have
seen defeats and have seen victories. And today, I say as a
United Brewery Worker that I know the rank and file will pretty
soon be ready to become a part of the Industrial Workers of the
World. There were days in this country when we had to work
sixteen and eighteen hours a day. I saw the progress that that
organization made under the leadership of progressive men in
those early days, and I saw how this organization was later on,
through the instrumentals of the capitalist class, made an
auxiliary of the capitalist system of society, not by the fault
of the rank and file themselves, but by their ignorance to
observe and their having too much confidence in leadership.
(Applause.) I have seen in this country, in the strikes and
lock-outs, the spirit of the men and women crushed. I have seen
them stand on the picket line. I have seen them when they were
making their masterly fight against the capitalist class, and I
have seen the labor lieutenants of the capitalist class crush the
spirit of the men in those days, with the assistance of a man who
to-day is paraded as a leader of labor, and I swore to myself
that the fight we have to make is against the capitalist system
as well as against those who are becoming and have been made the
agents of the capitalist class. The aim of this organization will
be to fight against the capitalist class with all its emissaries,
and the co-operation of every man and woman in this land is
necessary in order to make the battle successful. In accepting
this office in the Industrial Workers of the World I realize the
confidence that the representatives of the working class of this
country have placed in me. I realize also that the storm and the
fight will begin from this day on. Through all my life I have
tried to be on the right side, although I was always in the
minority, but it is not a shame or a disgrace to stand with the
minority, because a time will come when the minority will be the
majority. (Applause). The industrial organization of the working
class is going to be the strongest of the class conscious toilers
of this land; and when the message goes before the toilers, when
they realize what has been done at this convention, when they
realize that within them will lie the power of this organization
in the referendum vote, when they know that this organization is
going to spread, the men will become class conscious and will
take up their place as members of this organization, knowing that
we are building a structure that will be lasting and will not
fall to pieces as other organizations have done. We know that the
foundation of this organization is right; it is correct, and we
are bound to build up upon this foundation a structure whose
foundation is individual integrity, and while we have to go
through all these fights and the every-day struggle, we know that
our goal will be reached, and will be reached by the co-operation
of those who are longing for a better form of society. I look to
see the day when the working class will be their own masters, and
not the slaves of a master class; and with that object clear
before my eyes I pledge to this organization of the working
class, not to the representatives at this convention only, but to
the entire working class, the devoting of my energies to the
interests of the victims of the capitalist system of society, of
which I have been one. I thank you. (Applause.)</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Brother Haywood, will you please take the
Chair?</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: Have you got tired already?</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: I was tired before I came here.</p>
<p>(Delegate Haywood took the Chair.)</p>
<p>CHAIRMAN HAYWOOD: There are two members at large of the
Executive Board to be elected. Nominations will now be in
order.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: As I understand the recommendation of Committee
on Constitution on this matter, it provided that the convention
elect five members of the Executive Board, and not two. It seems
to me that we should pursue the course laid down by the
committee; that is, select one of them from the Western
Federation of Miners, one from the U. B. R. E., and one from the
United Metal Workers, and then two at large. I believe that was
the line laid down in the recommendation, and I think that we
ought to follow that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I followed the instructions of the
President.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Oh, you did?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This recommendation reads: &ldquo;Your Committee
on Constitution recommends that this convention elect a
Provisional Executive Board of seven to conduct the affairs of
the organization until its progress at the next national
convention. The said Provisional Board shall consist of the
General President, the General Secretary-Treasurer, and five
other members; two of these to be elected at large, one from the
United Metal Workers and one from the United Brotherhood of
Railway Employes. When the W. F. M., the U. B. R. E., and the
United Metal Workers elect their members on the General Executive
Board, the provisional delegates from their respective
organizations shall withdraw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then I am simply mistaken. The two general
officers then come first.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The two general officers have been disposed
of.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: The two at large come first. Your apology is
accepted, Mr. Chairman. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Nominations for delegates at large are in
order.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I would nominate as Delegate at Large Brother
Pat O&rsquo;Neil of Arkansas.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I was going to do the same thing. I want
to second the nomination of Pat O&rsquo;Neil.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I want to place in nomination before this
convention as a member of that executive committee one who is
conversant with the class movement of this country; who has
participated in its strifes and struggles; who I think is duly
qualified for the position. That man is the textile worker of
Providence, R. I., Thomas Powers. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I desire at this time to place in nomination a
brother who is well known in the northwest and Chicago, and
especially Canada; Brother John Riordan of Phoenix, British
Columbia.</p>
<p>DEL. BAKER: I rise to lend my voice in seconding the
nomination of Brother Riordan. I want to say that during the
entire period of my official connection with the Western
Federation of Miners I have had the pleasure of being in intimate
and close association with Brother Riordan, and I have always
found him what I believe an organization desires in an executive
officer.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: As I understand it now, we are to elect two on
the same ballot?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: At this time.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes, we are to select two at once?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, I have
no desire to waste the time of this convention in oratory as to
the qualifications of the candidate whom I wish to name. I only
want to say that he is well known in a heart of the jurisdiction
of this organization that will bring, I think immediately, its
greatest strength if it is properly and early looked after; a man
who is well known there for his work in organization. I wish to
place before the convention the nomination of F. W. Cronin of
Butte, Montana. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: I would like to place in nomination a brother
who knows a good deal about the form of organization that we have
established, and I think he belongs there on the executive
committee. I place in nomination Thomas J. Hagerty.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I decline.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I rise to second two of the nominations, without
disparagement to the others. The spirit of the resolution under
which we are working provides for a temporary representation on
the Executive Board by the organizations that have come
instructed to affiliate with this body. Of these organizations
three are already industrial organizations; they are the Western
Federation of Miners, the Brother of Railway Employes, and the
Metal Workers. The three are recognized by the resolution and
allowed to choose their representatives, so we are bound to have
representatives from them. But there are two other organizations
that will be ripped up after this convention adjourns, and both
of them have come with instructions to affiliate. These two
organizations are the A. L. U. and the S. T. &amp; L. A. Now, in
obedience to what I consider to be the spirit of the resolution
under which we are working, I rise to second the nomination of
Delegate Riordan of the A. L. U., and Delegate Powers of the S.
T. &amp; L. A. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: I rise to second the nominations of the two
delegates who have already been placed in nomination, and I think
both have been seconded; they were the delegate from Arkansas who
has introduced the Arkansas hog, and I also wish to introduce the
little fat pig from Rhode Island, Delegate Powers.
(Laughter.)</p>
<p>DEL. GILBERT: It seems to me an effort should be made to have
an element represented that will not be represented by the other
three. I am not going to say a word against those who have been
nominated. I know some of them, and I am fully certain that they
possess all the necessary qualifications, but for the sake of
having a broader representation I desire to place in nomination
an individual here who is very well known and who has had the
courage to ally himself with this organization in spite of the
fact that he occupies to-day an official position with the
American Federation of Labor; a man who is well known by the
masses; a man who has done considerable work for them in our
mining states. That man is Charles L. Spiegel of the Utah State
Federation of Labor. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I move you that the nominations be closed.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved that the nominations
now close. Are you ready for the question? (Question called for).
Those in favor will signify it by saying aye; contrary no. The
nominations are closed. I will appoint as tellers Brother White,
Brother Ross and Brother Klemensic.</p>
<p>DEL. ALBERT RYAN: I would like to ask what arrangements have
been made for casting our ballots.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There has been no provision made.</p>
<p>DEL. RYAN: I think there ought to be something done in the
matter before, we go any further, to avoid any possible
confusion.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: Mr. Chairman, if I understand the
resolution of the Constitution Committee, these members of the
Board are to be voted upon by those delegates who do not
represent the organizations that have already selected their
representatives, or are they to be voted on by all of the
delegates?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Smith, the spirit of the resolution of
this organization clearly sets forth that the administration
shall rest in its entire membership. Every Board member or
officer elected on the floor of this convention will be elected
by the entire convention.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: It is not an argument on my part as to how they
should be elected, but simply a question of information. I had
understood the resolutions to say that the other delegations
should withdraw pending the selection. I simply wanted to be put
right in the matter, that is all.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I do not so understand it. (The Chairman again
read the provisions.)</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: As I understand the motion as to the method of
voting, I perceive that there is going to be some difficulty
here. I move you that the Secretary call the roll, and that the
delegates as their names are mentioned state their preferences,
and in that way we will ascertain where the majority lies. Then
the tellers can count them if they like. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded that in the
election of officers the Secretary will call the roll, and the
delegates will announce their choice, and the tellers will so
record it.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: The number of votes.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I wish to make an amendment to the motion, that
the election be by ballot; that the Secretary will call out each
delegate&rsquo;s name with the number of votes, and that he
writes the number of his votes on one side of a piece of paper
and his choice on the other side, and as he deposits the ballot
in the hat he shall show the tellers the number of votes that he
casts, so that every one just casts his own vote. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded as an amendment
that the election shall be by ballot; that the Secretary shall
call the roll, the delegate will write the name of his choice on
one side of a slip of paper and the number of votes on the other,
and that he shall show the tellers the number of votes when he
deposits the ballot.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I rise to speak against the amendment. I contend
that in so far as no ruling has been taken on any vote taken for
the election of officers, and in so far as this amendment is
virtually a roll call with a subterfuge to dodge the record, I
hope this amendment will not prevail.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I oppose the amendment for the reason that it
will create confusion. Take for instance our own delegates. We
have been instructed to give the vote of our organization. We
have twelve ballots. Now then, if I cast a ballot I would not
know what share of the votes I would be casting. We have been
doing that during this convention, and this is a late hour to
establish a different method. We have during this convention been
voting the delegation as a unit. Now, by what process except one
that will keep us here all day almost&mdash;by what process are
we every time to find out who are the delegates present, and how
many happen to be absent, and in that way allot the vote of our
organization? I imagine that the same thing will happen with some
other organization. I fail to see what is accomplished by putting
the thing in shape of a ballot. If the Secretary calls the roll
as he has done hitherto, every time a man&rsquo;s name is
mentioned you know the vote he is casting, and they can mention
their candidates, getting up as they are called up. The ballot
system will confuse the matter, and besides confusing it it will
make it a long-drawn process.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, the only purpose I had in making my
motion was this: that this convention in the election of the two
officers that it has elected has followed absolutely the system
of balloting. Each of the officers that have been elected have
been elected on motions that an officer of this convention cast
the ballot of this convention. Practically I have never been in
an organization that elected its officers any other way than by
ballot. Now, in answer to the argument of the last
speaker&mdash;or not exactly in answer to the argument, but my
position on the vote is this, that if any group here desires to
vote its unanimous vote for any candidates it can so agree among
itself, and one of that group can cast its entire vote for the
candidates it decides on; as the S. T. &amp; L. A. delegate gets
up to cast his vote the Secretary will simply announce that the
S. T. &amp; L. A. casts 1,400 votes, or whatever the number is,
and the delegate will simply show to the tellers that he is
casting that number of votes, so there cannot be any confusion
about the thing. They are entitled to their delegation vote, and
they can cast it either separately or all together as they
please.</p>
<p>The question was put by the Chairman. Before the result was
announced Delegate Coates called for a division. A rising vote
was taken, resulting: yes, 37; no, 30. So the amendment was
carried.</p>
<p>The Chairman announced the candidates as Pat O&rsquo;Neil,
Thomas Powers, John Riordan, Frank W. Cronin and Charles L.
Spiegel. The delegates then deposited their votes in the manner
provided for in the amendment.</p>
<p>Delegate Miller was called to the chair to preside in place of
Delegate Haywood.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: If it will be in order, I move you that we
continue in session till we get through. I do not think there is
much business before the house, and I think we can get through
before adjournment. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. LANGDON: Mr. Chairman, as there are resolutions to come
before the house to be reported on, I object to that.</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: As the convention this morning has given power to
the Committee on Arrangements for the Ratification Meeting to
take up another collection in order to cover the deficit, I would
like to have you announce from the Chair that we shall take up
the collection at the present time.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will not be in order till after this vote
is taken.</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: To expedite matters, while they are
counting the vote I have a resolution. May I read it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I do not think it would be in order,
comrade.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: All right.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The convention will listen to the report of the
tellers.</p>
<p>The result of the ballot was announced by Delegate White, as
follows:</p>
<p>Pat O&rsquo;Neil: 8,278</p>
<p>John Riordan: 40,446</p>
<p>F. W. Cronin: 33,554</p>
<p>Thomas J. Powers: 7,189</p>
<p>C. L. Spiegel: 401</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegates Riordan and Cronin having received the
highest number of votes, or a majority of all the votes cast for
members of the Provisional Executive Council, I declare them
elected.</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: Mr. Chairman, I am glad to see the vote
cast as it was. Those men come from the two organizations that
have made this industrial organization possible. I thank the
delegates for the complimentary vote that was given me, who came
here empty-handed and alone. I can follow the work I do now. I
came here recognizing that the men who came here with
organizations behind them were the bone and sinew of this
movement, and I heartily congratulate those two men on their
election, and if I am not out of order I would like to make a
motion that the election of these two men be made unanimous.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, the next thing in order will be the
selection of members of the Executive Board by the delegations of
the Western Federation of Miners, the United Metal Workers and
the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I want to say, as chairman of the delegation, that
the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees yesterday afternoon
in session elected Brother Frank McCabe as their choice on the
Executive Board.</p>
<p>DEL. DINER: I move you that Brother Frank McCabe be the choice
of this convention on that committee. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried, and Delegate McCabe&rsquo;s
selection declared ratified by the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: As a representative of the United Metal Workers
I desire to place before this delegation the name of Charles
Kirkpatrick, of the United Metal Workers, as their representative
on the Executive Board.</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: I move you that the recommendation of the United
Metal Workers be concurred in by this convention, and that
Brother Kirkpatrick be the unanimous choice of this convention to
represent the United Metal Workers on the Executive Board.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>The Chairman put the motion and it was carried, and the
selection of Delegate Kirkpatrick was declared ratified by the
convention.</p>
<p>DEL. BAKER: On behalf of the Western Federation of Miners I
wish to say that the unanimous choice of our delegates is our
worthy President, Charles H. Moyer.</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: I move you that he be the unanimous
choice of this convention also. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried, and Delegate Moyer&rsquo;s
selection declared ratified by the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: The Committee on Constitution desires to
get through with its work and be discharged by this
convention.</p>
<h4>INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS.</h4>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move that we proceed with the installation of
those officers.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I do not think it is necessary to put the
motion. The next thing in order will be the installation of the
officers. It seems to me that the platform here is the proper
place for the members of the Executive Board, the
Secretary-Treasurer and the President of the organization as
well. In the installation this morning the Chairman overlooked
the obligation.</p>
<p>The officers and members of the Executive Board proceeded to
the platform and arranged themselves before the Chairman.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN (addressing the candidates): You have been
selected by the members of this organization to bear the
responsibilities of office. The post of difficulty and duty is
the post of honor. It is neither to be sought nor shunned. All
that the world has gained is the gift of the toilers. They stand
with empty hands, but they are coming to claim their own. It is
your duty to carry out the policies that will best defend their
interests. Your devotion and courage will hasten the day when
those who have known only toil and gloom shall enjoy the sunshine
and beauty of the world. Let neither praise nor slander take you
from the path of duty. The measure of your service will be the
measure of our love. You will now raise your right hand and
repeat after me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I. . . . . promise to fulfill the duties of my office
to the best of my ability. I promise to deliver all books,
papers, money or other property entrusted to my care to my
successor in office or faithfully account for the same. I shall
obey the constitution of the Industrial Workers of the World, in
letter and spirit. I further promise to use all my efforts to
secure unity of action among the workers, on both the political
and economic field, and never by any act of mine create
dissension in the councils or division in the ranks of the
workers. To all of which I pledge my sacred honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The obligation was taken by all the officers.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The officers and members of the Executive Board
of the Industrial Workers of the World are duly installed.
(Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Are we under the head of unfinished business
yet?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I think the next thing in the regular order is
the selection of the meeting place.</p>
<p>Here Delegate Miller retired and President Sherman took the
chair.</p>
<h4>SELECTION OF HEADQUARTERS.</h4>
<p>DEL. HALL: Mr. Chairman, do I understand that the business of
selecting the headquarters of this organization is now under
consideration?</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: I did not understand that there was a committee
appointed to select headquarters. I understood it was to be left
to the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Then is that the matter before the convention
now?</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Well, I am going to make a suggestion. I am going
to nominate a place for the headquarters of this organization. I
do not care to occupy too much of your time, but I would like to
go just a little into details in order to show you why I am
making this selection. Now, the natural conclusion of a person is
that the headquarters of an organization of this kind should be
at the industrial center of the United States, but I do not agree
with that opinion. It occurs to me that it should be closely
situated to the industrial center of the United States, but I
believe that to establish it directly within the industrial
center of the United States has a bad effect upon the
organization itself. I have been at a number of points and cities
where the headquarters of the different organizations have been,
and I have always found that it has a baneful influence upon the
organized labor of that particular point. You take the cities of
the United States where the headquarters of any organization that
is well known is located, and you will find that the laboring
people are not organized in that place. I would cite to you
Indianapolis, one of the headquarters cities of the United
States, and I venture to say that it is one of the least
organized cities in the United States to-day; and I believe that
if you will look over the ground you will find that that applies
in every city where there is a headquarters of an organization
that really amounts to anything. Now, I do not attempt to say why
this is, but I believe it is due to the fact that too much
dependence is placed upon the general headquarters by the
membership of the organization when they are immediately in
contact with it. Now, we want for a headquarters a place where
offices can be equipped and maintained cheaply; a place where
printing can be done cheaply, and a place where we have easy
connections with the industrial centers of the United States.
Now, I am going to suggest the town of Joliet, Illinois, as the
headquarters of the industrial union movement, for this reason:
We have several railways connecting with Joliet; we have a number
of electric lines connecting with Joliet; and I venture to say
that all the printing that is done for the organization will
probably be done in Joliet because it can be done cheaper and be
done better; and then the office rent in a city like Joliet is
much lower than any place else, and that is going to be a
considerable item for an organization in locating itself. Joliet
is a well-advertised city. There isn&rsquo;t anybody in the
United States but what knows of Joliet, and it has easy access
from all parts of the United States, just as much so as Chicago.
And then if there is any baneful influence coming from the
headquarters of the organization, for instance, taking the board
of directors that was just initiated into this organization, I
have never seen any place better guarded if we wanted to seclude
those men as much as possible from public gaze. Therefore I
suggest Joliet, Illinois, as the headquarters. (Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: I am not much in favor Joliet. You know what
they have got there. I think Joliet is a very safe place for the
headquarters of the Industrial Workers of the World, but I
don&rsquo;t see that that is any reason why we should go there. I
have in mind a little town nearly as big as Joliet, but it will
probably be more serviceable for the purposes of the Industrial
Workers of the World, and that town is Chicago. (Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: I want to nominate a town which has been placed
upon the map several times&mdash;Milwaukee.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, I want to make a motion that the
selection of headquarters of this organization be left with the
Executive Board of this organization. Now, I do this at this time
for this reason: We all more or less have had experience in the
labor movement. We realize that from now on the struggle will
become more and more intense. We, realize that this organization
is going to grow and be powerful; that it is going to be
surrounded by every condition that opposition can bring. Now,
personally I am opposed to the headquarters being in a large
industrial center or a large town, for this reason, that you are
surrounded on every hand by all kinds of spies and detectives,
and it is almost impossible for the headquarters to protect
itself against them. In large towns you will find them by the
hundreds. I think any small place contiguous and accessible to a
big town is preferable for the headquarters; I think that there
the headquarters can guard itself absolutely against the outside,
and I want the Board to take these things into consideration, and
that is the reason I make the motion that the selection of the
headquarters be referred to the Board.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: I will willingly second the motion of
Delegate Coates that the selection of a city wherein the
headquarters of the Industrial Workers of the World are to be
located for the ensuing year be left to the Executive Board. I
have confidence in the Executive Board selected by this
convention. I believe that they will be guided by reason, and
that they will select such a place as the conditions under which
we are to continue the struggle for the emancipation of mankind
shall make most appropriate and most convenient for conducting
our affairs. While I am an insignificant factor in this
convention, I again second the motion of Delegate Coates that the
selection of the headquarters, of the city or place within which
the headquarters of the organization shall be left with the
Executive Board.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I am in favor of Chicago, and I will tell you
why. A remark was made by Delegate Coates that the capitalists
will have their spies about us in a large industrial center. But
if you take the headquarters to Quincy or some other small town,
do you suppose the capitalists would not keep spies on you all
the time? Is it the purpose of this organization to evade the
eyes of capitalist spies? We have nothing to hide from them. We
state our purpose in the Manifesto. Our purpose is ostensibly to
take control of the means of life. That is what we are working
for. Chicago is the proper place. It is the place where all can
come. Read French history and you will find that Paris is always
the center of the revolutionary spirit. We want Chicago as the
headquarters because it is going to be the center of the economic
revolution. If we place the headquarters at Joliet we will have
to come to Chicago first, any way. Chicago is centrally located.
It is the center of two million people. It is the industrial
center of the United States. Delegate Coates said&mdash;maybe I
am a little out of order&mdash;the gentleman said that if there
was any opposition to this organization that it would not last
another year. He goes on and says it is going to grow.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I did not say any such thing.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I beg your pardon. You said it might last
another year, and I will leave it to the delegates.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I didn&rsquo;t say any such thing.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: That was your argument. I will leave it to the
delegates.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: The selection of a location for headquarters is
the business before the convention, and two towns have been
placed in nomination. If I understand the proposition right, any
delegate has a right to place in nomination any town that in his
judgment would be a proper location.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: A point of order. Isn&rsquo;t there a
proposition before the house, and a second?</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: I rule the motion out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that at this time
we should dump everything onto the incoming Executive Board. I
believe the time has come for decisive action. We know what we
want and we know how we want it. I do not believe in making
motions to refer everything to the incoming Executive Board.
Their load will be heavy enough before they get through with
their labors, without encumbering them, with the insignificant
proposition of selecting headquarters. It is immaterial to me
where the headquarters are situated. What concerns me most is the
action of the men that will constitute the Executive Board at
that headquarters; that is the vital point, and I hope a decision
will soon be reached.</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: Mr. Chairman, I have just a suggestion
to make, and that is this: The men elected on that National
Executive Board come from the west and northwest, with the
exception of two. The great bulk of this organization lies in the
west and northwest, and at the present time and for the next year
the headquarters of this organization should be near the body
behind it. That is the only idea that I have got about this
thing, and I would suggest that for the first year at least the
headquarters of this organization be somewhere further west, four
or five or six or seven or eight hundred miles west of here where
the body of its strength is.</p>
<p>DEL. GILBERT: I was going to suggest a point very similar to
what Del. Pat O&rsquo;Neil has, for this reason: There is no
doubt at all in my mind but what this organization, if it is to
be successful, must be in touch with the people where it wants to
do something, and that will be west of Chicago unquestionably.
But while we are discussing the idea of the place I wish to offer
a suggestion that might be adopted later on, and that is that
after you have got a strong influence built up for the
organization there is only one place, in my estimation, that
should be considered for the permanent headquarters, and that is
the place that we expect to capture in a little while,
Washington, D. C. We ought to get right there under the shadow of
the capitol. (Applause). Don&rsquo;t be sentimental about this.
There is something more than sentiment attached to it. There we
are not at a seat of industry. All of you men who have had a
great deal of experience know that it is a good thing that we are
away from the conflict. You want to be away from that, and you
also want to be where you can have good postal facilities and
also good transportation facilities, and Washington, D. C.,
offers you those things, and the fact that it is already the
headquarters of the American Federation of Labor shows that in my
estimation it was a good thing to go there, and that when we camp
right on their trail we will also be where we can keep our hand
upon the whole pulse of the labor problem and upon the
legislation of this country. But I think that for the first year
at least it would be a great deal better to place the
headquarters further west, and I think it would be very much
better to have them in a city like Denver for the first year.</p>
<p>(Delegate Haywood was called to the chair).</p>
<p>PRESIDENT SHERMAN: I would like to say a word on this, Mr.
Chairman and Brother Delegates. I believe we have in nomination
three points&mdash;four now; Joliet, Chicago, Milwaukee and
Denver. The objection has been raised to Joliet on account of the
high walls. Perhaps it would be all right to have them nearer the
high walls, and I want to say to the brothers that if it ever
becomes necessary to put men behind the high walls it would not
cost anything for the transportation and they could get us there
very quick. But I think the brother who is talking about
Washington is afraid that the Executive Board and the officers of
the Industrial Workers of the World will perhaps desire at
certain times to exercise their right at the ballot box, and he
is trying to disfranchise them by locating them in a town where
they cannot vote, which is Washington, D. C. A brother laid great
stress on the fact that the bulk of our organization force was in
the west. It is at the present time, but I feel that the baby has
only been born, and it is going to grow, and before the next
convention we are going to have strength all around Chicago in
every direction. I can concur in Brother Coates&rsquo;s remarks
as to a large industrial center for a labor organization, and
especially a National labor organization, and while I appreciate
with all kindness the other brother who stated that they wanted
the headquarters at the seat of war, which is very good, yet I
want to say to you, brothers, that you have imposed a burden upon
the officers and the Executive Board of this organization such as
has never been imposed upon a set of officers in any labor
organization in the past. I want to say to you, brothers, that
that matter will be taken up when we get to work and get to
talking about handling the welfare and the progress of this
organization; and while I as President will always grasp the hand
of any sister or brother, I realize the fact that in a large
industrial center the enthusiasm of the rank and file of the
sisters and brothers will naturally draw them to our office many
times for nothing more than to pay their respects, but at the
same time when they are paying their respects they may be taking
up some of the most valuable time that we have got, which might
be used in doing the work that should be done. So I realize
keenly that a small town near an industrial center is far
superior for those whom you have chosen to serve you, because you
want them to do the work and you expect them to do the work.
Hence, if you place them in a place where they will naturally be
subjected to the more or less unnecessary paying of visits you
place them in a position where they will not be able to carry out
the work that they could and would like to do and that which you
expect them to do. Hence, if I could entertain the motion of
Brother Coates I should have done so: not with the idea, by any
means, that this Executive Board should have any power not vested
in them by the Constitution, but that they might use their own
good judgment. I presume we will have to have a temporary office
to begin with, any way. I expect that, owing to the position that
we are in financially. We are not at the present time in a
position to go to any town and there rent any particular
headquarters, and I do not see the necessity of it at the present
moment. Owing to the fact that the United Metal Workers has quite
a large office on West Madison street, I will say that the
Industrial Workers of the World may have the rent of it free for
the benefit of the organization. (Applause.) But I realize this,
that those who never occupied an official position realize very
little the amount of company that has to be entertained in those
offices, and every moment, every second, sometimes, is worth
dollars while a brother or sister may be there with a very
important message, or you perhaps at that very moment are just at
the point of writing some very important telegram and have called
a boy over to take the telegram; a message that you want to go
into the field where there is a battle and where the receipt of
that message may have an effect on that battle. Hence I say,
brothers and sisters, that I have realized keenly for years from
my own experience and from the experiences of those who have held
executive office, that a small town near a large industrial
center, where they have good access to the mail and communication
and transportation, is superior to a large industrial center. If
you will talk to those who have had experience they will make the
same statement to you. Now that is all I desire to say on that,
and I thank you.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I do not desire to go into an argument, because I
want to save time. I want to do what I think the best thing for
the organization. And I am not going to appeal from the decision
of the Chair. But, for the life of me, I cannot understand why
you ruled my motion out of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: For the reason that the Chair announced that the
convention was to have the naming of the headquarters or locality
for the headquarters, and I had accepted nominations previous to
your making the motion. Now I would feel that it would be
necessary for the nominees or those who have placed the different
towns in nomination, to withdraw their nominations, and then your
motion would be in order.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: All right, I think my motion is still in order,
because the convention has the power at any time to delegate its
powers to the Executive Board. We have done that time and time
again by resolutions before the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I rise to move the previous question.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: For the sake of harmony, though Milwaukee is so
close to Chicago, and I think when the electric lines are
finished Milwaukee will be superior to Chicago, I withdraw my
choice of Milwaukee.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move as an amendment to Chicago, Washington,
Joliet and other towns, that these places be referred to the
incoming Executive Board for their consideration. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I moved the previous question, and it was
seconded.</p>
<p>The motion of Delegate White was seconded.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: I desire at this time to offer a
substitute for all the motions and amendments, namely, that the
matter of the selection of a headquarters for the provisional
government of the Industrial Workers of the World be left to the
Executive Board. Now, before I relinquish the floor I would ask
if the Chair would entertain that motion as a substitute.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I believe it would be in order.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: That is all I desire to know.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I second the motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A substitute has been offered to leave the
selection of headquarters to the incoming Executive Board. Are
you ready for the question? (Question asked for). Those in favor
of the same will signify it by saying aye. Contrary minded no.
The ayes have it and it is so ordered. I will announce now that
the temporary headquarters will be at 148 West Madison street,
Chicago, until further notice.</p>
<h4>COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTION.</h4>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I ask for the consideration of this report
so that we will get through with it, as one of the Constitution
Committee cannot remain here more than ten or fifteen minutes
longer. The committee yesterday did not finish their work on the
constitution report.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Constitution Committee has a further report
to make.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: A further report, and I think that will be
all.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will hear the report of the Constitution
Committee.</p>
<p>Del. Hagerty, of the Committee, read the following report:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, your Committee, further recommend that Delegate
Haggerty&rsquo;s resolution, from the Butte Milling and Smelter
Men&rsquo;s Union, receive the careful consideration of the
General Executive Board, and that as soon as possible an
educational system appropriately financed be established for the
purpose of training the workers in the principles of industrial
unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. GILLHAUS: I move to concur in the recommendation of the
committee. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>On motion of Delegate Held the Committee on Constitution was
discharged.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: The Resolutions Committee has completed its work,
and I ask that the Committee be discharged by the convention. It
was moved and seconded that the Committee be discharged with a
vote of thanks.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: Cut out the thanks. The proletarian doesn&rsquo;t
need any thanks for his services. (Applause.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>The Committee on Literature and Press being called for,
announced that it had no further report to make. On motion of
Delegate Coates the Committee was discharged.</p>
<h4>COMPENSATION OF OFFICERS.</h4>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: A point of information. Now that we have elected
and installed our President, our Secretary-Treasurer and the
Executive Board, what compensation are they going to receive? I
failed to hear of any compensation for our executive officers or
any provisions made for the compensation of our President or
Secretary-Treasurer in our Constitution. While I was absent a few
hours from this convention this morning they may have made some
provision of that kind but I failed to hear it. I want to know if
this convention desires that our President and
Secretary-Treasurer and other executive officers are to serve the
Industrial Workers of the World without any compensation. I would
like to have that question settled before we adjourn, and not
leave it to the officers themselves to fix their own compensation
and thereby raise dissension among the rank and file.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I will state for the benefit of the brother that
I believe the constitution provides for the President and General
Secretary-Treasurer, if I am not mistaken. There is no provision
made for the members of the Executive Board. As you remember,
only those who come from at large come from the organizations.
There is no provision made, to my best recollection, for the
members of the Executive Board, as to their remuneration for
services.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Will you announce that there is a collection to be
taken up for the deficit from the ratification meeting, a
shortage of five dollars.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The brother states to me that there was a
shortage of meeting the expenditures of the Committee on
Ratification of something about five dollars, and he asks the
privilege of taking up a collection. We will proceed to take up a
collection at the present time.</p>
<p>DEL. MOTHER JONES: Owing to the fact that there is no money in
the treasury to start this organization with, it seems to me it
would be good policy to leave the decision of the salaries to the
incoming officers. I for one am not afraid to trust those
officers with fixing the salaries that will compensate the
officers, and I think it will be satisfactory to the body as a
whole. I do not know that this body here could now decide what is
best to do with regard to the salaries, as long as we have no
funds to begin with. When the funds grow larger and it is worth
while making a decision about that, I believe that is time enough
for us to begin. (Motion seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, Mother, will you please state that motion
again? Just make the motion so that I can understand it.</p>
<p>DEL. MOTHER JONES: My motion is to refer the salary question
to the incoming officers, the Executive Board. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the salaries of the members of the Executive Board be referred to
the executive officers. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: Am I to understand that the Executive Board
itself is to fix the salaries of the members of the Executive
Board and the others?</p>
<p>DEL. JOHNSON: I would like to offer as an amendment to the
motion that the compensation of the Executive Board shall be in
accordance with the wages that the different members of that
board receive, and in addition the extra expenses connected with
their work. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There has been an amendment made to the motion,
but I wish you would make that amendment again, as short as
possible.</p>
<p>DEL. JOHNSON: I offer an amendment to the motion, that the
compensation of the members of the Executive Board shall be equal
to the wages that they receive in their respective vocations, and
in addition to that the expenses incurred by their work.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the amendment to the motion,
which has been duly seconded. Are you ready for the question on
the amendment? (Question called for). Those who are in favor of
the same will signify it by saying aye. Contrary minded no. The
ayes have it and it is so carried.</p>
<h4>LITERATURE AND PRESS COMMITTEE.</h4>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: As a member of the Press Committee I have been
approached by several delegates in view of the fact that the
Daily People published the doings of this convention and an
article that after I read it I took it as a direct slap at the
convention; it is a slap at practically myself. I want to read
the article, how it was written in regard to the session, and
which it published as the eighth day session, taken up with the
Coates amendment destroying the principle of industrial
unionism.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I rise to a point of order. I would be perfectly
willing for any one to take up the question of the Daily People
or any other paper if we had time to discuss it. At this late
hour the convention would have no such opportunity. The
capitalist press and all other papers hostile to this convention
have been lying about us, misrepresenting us, and no action has
been taken upon that. What does this move mean of trumping up a
charge against the Daily People at this late hour when the
convention is on the point of adjourning? To do so, in this way,
at this time, is out of order because the convention cannot have
sufficient time to consider the matter. I raise that as a point
of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The point is well taken. The Chair rules that we
are under the regular order of business at this time, and there
is unfinished business, the report of the Ways and Means
Committee, to be heard.</p>
<h4>STENOGRAPHIC REPORT.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Ways and Means Committee made a report. That
report was that there be an assessment of five cents levied on
the membership of this organization, which was amended that there
be an assessment of one dollar, to pay the expenses incurred in
launching this organization and to provide for a stenographic
report. An amendment to the amendment was offered providing for
an assessment of one dollar and that the stenographic report be
not considered. What is the pleasure of the convention with
regard to this report as amended and the amendment to the
amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I move that the recommendation of the committee
be concurred in. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order. The question before
the convention at this time occurs on the amendment to the
amendment, which provides for a one dollar assessment on the
entire membership of the organization.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Would a motion be in order at this time as a
substitute for the whole?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A motion would be in order as a substitute.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move as a substitute for the whole that this
matter of these recommendations and amendments be referred to the
Executive Board for their consideration. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded as a
substitute that the proposition of levying an assessment, the
report of the Ways and Means Committee, be referred to the
Executive Board. Are you ready for the question? (Question called
for.)</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I am opposed to the substitute because the
matter of the stenographic report is involved.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Not in this amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Not exactly, but the substitute for the whole
refers the whole thing to the incoming board, doesn&rsquo;t
it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It refers the entire matter to the incoming
board.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: And the stenographic report likewise.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: For that reason I am against the substitute. If
it is decided to have a stenographic report let us find it out.
The Board has work enough on hand and will not be able to
undertake it. The Board starts out without a cent in the
treasury. The stenographic report so far, since we have had
anything to do with it, is the property of the Daily People. I
stated when the convention opened that since the expense would be
larger than anticipated we were willing to make it the property
of the convention if the convention would pay the difference.
Now, if this thing is referred to the incoming board or to the
President of this organization, as stated by one comrade here,
the stenographic report will be ancient history by the time it is
published. Now as a matter of right this stenographic report is
the property of the Daily People, and we can put it through
quickly, long before the Board can have come to a decision and
long before it can have raised the funds for that. The
stenographic notes are valueless as they are now. They are
valuable only if we have stenographic notes transcribed. You all
know that it takes time to collect funds, and a person who works
wants to know who is going to pay him for it. I am authorized to
say that the stenographic report can be published, that the
publication of it can be begun immediately by the Daily People.
Consequently I am against the substitute. If the substitute fails
I shall move to lay the whole matter upon the table, so that the
stenographic report remains where it was when this convention
opened; my reason being that in no other way can the stenographic
report be published in time to be of interest. My purpose is to
publish it as soon as the report can be transcribed, running it
every day in the Daily People until we are through with it, and
that will not be effected if you pass it over to the incoming
executive board.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Your motion is to lay the matter on the
table?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: No, I argued against the substitute motion for
the reasons I have given.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Did you make a motion to lay the entire matter
on the table?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: No, I could not make such a motion after arguing
on the substitute. I stated that if this substitute motion is
defeated I shall then make a motion to lay the whole thing upon
the table, the motion on the assessment and the motion on the
stenographic report and everything.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I wish to speak on the motion. The Ways and Means
Committee recommended to the convention that the report be
adopted. In preference to the position that the brother takes on
this matter, that the stenographic report is not going to be
printed, we might just as well start in right. There are other
things besides the stenographic report here. There was over $100
borrowed from one individual to carry on the preliminary work of
this convention, and I think that is much more important. for
this convention than the stenographic report at the present
time.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I understand that any other motion is out of
order without the consent of the convention. I would request that
I be allowed to divide the question. I agree with the delegate
that the matter of this stenographic report has been jumbled up
with the matter of the assessment. Will the Chair allow me to
make a motion to divide the question? There are two distinct
questions in that report of the committee and in all the
amendments. One question is the question of the assessment, and
another question is the question as to the stenographic report. I
beg leave to divide that question into two. Will the Chair or the
convention allow it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It occurs to me that such a motion would be
placing the Chair in rather a peculiar position.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: All right.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I would rather not put this motion.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: I understand the motion before the house
is the motion to refer the entire matter to the incoming
Executive Board.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I am in favor of that motion. I believe the
Board is in a position to know exactly the amount of money they
will have in a very few days and be able to make a recommendation
and report to this organization. They will know exactly about the
amount of money that can be raised and how quick they can raise
it, and I am in favor of referring the entire proposition to the
incoming Executive Board.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate McDonald, did you take into
consideration the statement of Delegate De Leon, that it is
desired that they be given property in this stenographic report
so that they can take up the publishing of it? Did you understand
that?</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I am not in favor of giving them that power. I
think this should become the property of the Executive Board, and
if the delegate desires to use this he may get it with the
consent of the Executive Board after it is given to the Executive
Board.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, but it is the property of the Daily People
at the present time; they have paid their money for it.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: Well, with the proviso that if the convention
desires the report. Now, the Executive Board can determine as to
whether they desire it. If they desire not to have the report,
then leave the proposition to them.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: For that very reason the result would be to
place the convention in an awkward position, whether the
Executive Board decided that they do want it, or that they do not
want it. Suppose they decide that they do not want to publish it,
that would prevent us from publishing it in time, because we
would have to wait until their decision. You put it, by such a
motion, in a rather awkward position and put yourselves in an
awkward position. What is the position in which you place
yourselves and those who have already borne the expense thus far?
Without their work in this direction there would have been no
stenographic report, because this man was not going to work on
tick, on promises to pay. He has been paid already for last week,
and is to be paid to-day. We pay this bill, and yet you put
yourselves in the absurd posture of saying that what we have paid
for becomes your property; and you try to manoeuvre us into the
unjust position of not having anything at all. Suppose on the
other hand that it is finally decided by the Board that they do
not want the report, what would be the situation if your motion
prevails? At the late hour when the Board may decide that it does
not want the report, it would have become stale matter if we then
start its publication. Or is it your purpose to try and deprive
us even then of the right to publish it. We are ready to go on
with it right here. If the delegate will explain to me what sense
there is in that motion I may be willing to accept his view of
it, but as the motion now stands we and you, especially you, are
put in an absurd position. This report is the property of the
Daily People. You rejected the motion of Delegate Smith; you
rejected the motion of the Committee on Ways and Means: and had
we acted on the spirit that disposed of those motions we would
have discharged the stenographer on the spot, and then there
would have been no stenographic record of the transactions of
this convention. But we saw the value to the Movement of
preserving this record, and so, while you were hanging fire and
this convention was making history, we continued the expense of
the stenographer&rsquo;s fees. Now, it is a matter of courtesy on
our part to consider this thing any further in the hands of this
convention; it is a matter of pure courtesy; and knowing that, I
hold that the only legitimate way for this convention to act is
to defeat the motion of Brother White. If that motion is
defeated, I shall then make a motion to lay upon the table so
much of the committee&rsquo;s recommendation as concerns the
stenographic report. Then the rest of the motion can be taken up
afterwards.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate De Leon, to get the sense of this
question properly before the convention, the Chair will entertain
a motion to divide the question.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: That is just what I asked leave to do. Then I
move that the question of the stenographic report and the
question of the assessment of one dollar involved in this motion
and in the amendment and in the amendment to the amendment be
divided. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion to divide was put and carried.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Now I move you that the matter of the
stenographic report be left where it was when this convention
opened. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion now will occur on the substitute,
which is to refer the Ways and Means Committee&rsquo;s report,
that regarding the assessment, to the incoming Executive Board.
Are you ready for the question? (Question asked for). Those in
favor will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is
carried.</p>
<h4>FINANCES.</h4>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Mr. Chairman, repeatedly in the last few moments it
has been declared from the floor of this convention that the
incoming officials have nothing in the way of finances to do
anything with. On this eighth day of July, one hour ago, we
ceased to be a convention and became an organization. I move that
every member of this organization that has been installed at this
time and place, as the Secretary shall call the roll, shall come
forward and pay his first month&rsquo;s dues of fifty cents, and
thereby put something in the treasury.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: You have got to pay it to the respective
organizations.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: When he gets back home it will appear on the record
here that his dues are paid for a month, won&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: Is there anything more to come before the
organization?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I know of nothing further.</p>
<h4>MISCELLANEOUS.</h4>
<p>DEL. HELD: The Ways and Means Committee has not been
discharged, and the Committee on Ratification has not been
discharged.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move that they be discharged. (Seconded.) THE
CHAIRMAN: Did the Committee on Ratification Meeting get enough
money to pay their bills?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: They did not get enough money, but the proprietor
of the hall took what we got and called it square.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair would say that the committee should
not be discharged until they had liquidated all their debts.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: We have got the bill and the debts have been
liquidated, and we owe absolutely nothing to anybody.</p>
<p>The motion to discharge the committees was carried.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move that we now adjourn.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN (DEL. HAYWOOD): Just a moment. I want the
President here when we adjourn. Is there any further business to
come before the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Have we decided on the place where the next
convention is to be held?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I do not believe it has been decided.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Of course the constitution, as I understand it,
fixes the first Monday in May, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The first Monday in May is the date, but the
place has not been named.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move that this matter be referred to the
incoming Executive Board. By that time they will know what
organizations have joined and in what place it would be advisable
to hold that convention; they will be in a much better position
to decide. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, delegates, the temporary Chairman has a
request to make of this convention. At the opening of the
convention I was presented by some one with a gavel. I do not
know to whom that gavel belongs, but I would very much like to
retain it, and I would like to ask the privilege of this
convention to do so.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I move that the request be granted.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I move that the Chairman take possession
of that gavel in the name of this organization, of the Industrial
Workers of the World. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: Before you put the motion I wish to state that
there is another comrade there at the door that has got the stick
that Comrade Haywood called the meeting to order with, so that he
has got a rival in Chicago to that gavel.</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: I have a resolution that I would like
to offer and move its adoption:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, During the period from the issuance of the
Manifesto to the convening of this congress of industrial
workers, the Miners&rsquo; Magazine, the Chicago Arbeiter
Zeitung, the Crisis, the Cleveland Arbeiter Zeitung and the Daily
People have uncompromisingly advocated our cause; therefore be
it</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resolved, That we, the Industrial Workers of the World,
express our thankfulness to the above mentioned journals for
their support of industrial unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motion seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of this resolution.
What is your pleasure?</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: Question on the gavel.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is my request in regard to the ownership of the
gavel granted?</p>
<p>DEL. SHURTLEFF: I would like to state that that gavel is the
property of the International Machinists&rsquo; Union. It has
been carried by me all over the country from the West to the
East. Personally I am willing for the Chairman to keep it. I
don&rsquo;t think there will be any question about it, and really
I would rather see him keep it than any other man.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I thank you very much, Delegate Shurtleff. I
will put this with the chart and the chairman&rsquo;s badge, in
one group. What is the pleasure of the convention in regard to
this resolution?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I have no objection to the resolution at all,
except I know of a number of other papers, that I cannot call by
name just now, which have done valiant service for this Manifesto
and for this organization since the issuance of the Manifesto. A
number of them are small papers out in the community or in the
part of the United States in which I live, and I think, Mr.
Chairman, if we are going to do this, if we are going to offer
thanks to somebody that in my opinion simply did their duty, let
us include them all. Let us not only name four or five that are
the most prominent and exclude a number of others that are
entitled to the same thanks, but let us include them all. I am in
favor of that motion.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move, to amend that resolution by adding the
words: &ldquo;and all other papers that have upheld the cause of
industrial unionism.&rdquo; If any one can name them, let them be
placed in that resolution, so as to include them all. (Amendment
seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment is that the names of all other
papers that are known be added to this list? Is that it?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: The amendment is to add &ldquo;and all other
papers that have stood for the cause of industrial
unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: &ldquo;And all other papers that have stood by
the cause of industrial unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. FITZGERALD: If I am not out of order I would like the
Voice of Labor inserted in there.</p>
<p>DEL. GILBERT: I think this is all out of order. The Crisis was
the first paper to champion this cause, and I prefer not to put
in any names. As the delegate here said, we only did our duty,
and therefore what do we want a vote of thanks for? Therefore I
move as a substitute that the whole thing be laid on the table.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Is he to be allowed to make a speech on a motion
to lay on the table?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I object to the substitute, on the ground
that there are very few labor papers in this country that have
endorsed the Manifesto. By looking at the labor exchanges we can
find out the names of the other labor papers or journals that
have endorsed this working class movement, and it seems to me
right and proper here that we should express some recognition of
the fact; that these papers and whatever other papers may be
known be recognized as supporting our cause. If there are other
papers, it ought to be no great matter to find out their names.
Every man here who has been in the labor exchanges since the
issuing of that Manifesto can find that out. As soon as the other
papers outside of the Voice of Labor are known, I think they can
very easily be specified, and not make any error in the names.
There are a number of papers that have supported the movement,
but I personally do not know any others outside of that, and I
have been in the labor exchanges since the issuance of the
Manifesto. I would like to know the names of those that support
this Manifesto and have them added to that resolution.</p>
<p>The motion on the substitute to lay on the table was lost. The
amendment of Delegate De Leon was then carried, and the
resolution was adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chairman, unfortunately the Assistant
Secretary of this convention incurred some loss, partially, I
suppose, owing to the fact that she was acting as Secretary of
this convention; that is, she lost some effects, and the matter
was presented to this convention yesterday. Whether or not the
loss has been recovered or replaced I am unable to say, but I
believe that the work that she has done and the attention that
she has given to the duties of Assistant Secretary of this
convention are worthy of consideration and a just and fair
recompense. I move you at this time that the Executive Board be
instructed to pay out of the first money available in the
treasury of the Industrial Workers of the World a just, fair and
equitable compensation for the services rendered to this
convention by the Assistant Secretary, Mrs. Langdon.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried, and the Chairman directed the
Executive Board to take notice accordingly.</p>
<p>Chairman Haywood retired and President Sherman resumed the
Chair.</p>
<p>There being no further business to come before the convention,
the President at 1.20 P. M. declared the first convention of the
Industrial Workers of the World adjourned <em>sine die</em>.</p>
