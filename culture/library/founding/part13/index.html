<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>EIGHTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Wednesday, July 5</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>The convention was called to order at 9.20 by Chairman
Haywood.</p>
<p>The roll of delegates was called by the Secretary.</p>
<p>The Secretary read the minutes of the previous day&rsquo;s
sessions.</p>
<p>CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of the minutes. Are there
any corrections? I would ask that the Secretary insert the
correct number where the vote on the roll call occurs.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: The number was 47,728 against the amendment;
3,540 for the amendment.</p>
<p>The minutes were then approved.</p>
<h4>Communication.</h4>
<p>The following communication was received from the Socialist
Labor Party at Pittsburg, Pa., and on motion it was placed on
file:</p>
<p>Pittsburg, Pa., July 4.</p>
<p>The Industrial Union Convention, W. E. Trautmann, Secretary,
Brand&rsquo;s Hall: Comrades, the Socialist Labor Party of
Pennsylvania in State Convention assembled at Pittsburg, in the
name of the oncoming revolution greet you. Hew to the line of
class-conscious solidarity; make no mistake, give us a working
men&rsquo;s and working women&rsquo;s organization, as harsh and
radical as capitalism itself.</p>
<p>D. E. Gilchrist, Sec&rsquo;y convention, Osmond Hall, 1921
Carson Street, S. S. Pittsburg, Pa.</p>
<h4>Reports.</h4>
<p>No report was offered by the Committee on credentials.</p>
<h4>Ratification Meeting.</h4>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: As a member of the committee appointed
yesterday for the purpose of a ratification meeting, I will state
that the committee has made arrangements to use this hall Friday
night, the 7th, and the committee is arranging to advertise the
proposition as extensively as the occasion justifies. I believe
that is all that the committee has to report.</p>
<p>DEL. Schwartz: A point of information. I would like to ask if
the committee has decided upon the list of speakers.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: Yes, I will state that the committee has agreed
upon four speakers: upon Mr. Debs, Mr. Moyer, Mr. Coates and Mr.
Sherman as the four principal speakers.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: Is a motion in order?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We are listening now to the report of the
committee. Do you want to make a motion as to this report?</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: I would like to amend that by adding Comrade De
Leon&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>DEL. KNIGHT: I would like to ask that committee how it is that
the press gets these reports before the convention gets them. All
that has been reported by that committee appears in this
morning&rsquo;s paper.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I will state, Mr. President, that the committee
thought it was proper for them to get the matter advertised as
extensively as possible, and if this paper desired to advertise
it it is entirely satisfactory to the committee, and we simply
announced that to the newspaper men yesterday afternoon. That is
how it came to get into the papers.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: Since we know the names of the four speakers
that are intended to speak at that meeting, and I do not see any
one from the Socialist Trade &amp; Labor Alliance, I would like
to have some comrade from the Socialist &amp; Labor Alliance also
speak at that meeting.</p>
<p>DEL. McDonald: I will state that the committee on speakers at
the ratification meeting agreed upon this plan: that Eugene V.
Debs was representing the Socialists and the radical element in
this convention; that Delegates Moyer, Coates and Sherman were
representing the trades union end of the proposition, and in that
way all the elements in this convention were honestly represented
as the speakers are appointed by this committee.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I move you that the following comrades be added to
the list of speakers: Comrade De Leon, Hagerty, Haywood and
Trautmann. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the four names just read be added to the number of speakers at
that meeting. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. GUY MILLER: At first there were a great many candidates
to be placed on the speakers&rsquo; list. At first the committee
would have been glad to hear from all of them, but we realized
that time was to be considered in this matter. The number of
members of the various organizations represented here was taken
into consideration, the Western Federation of Miners being the
most numerous; and while personally I wanted very much to have
the worthy Chairman of this convention on the list of speakers,
yet we realized that we had the lion&rsquo;s share of the honors
of this convention. President Moyer had hardly been heard from,
and so he was chosen for that place. Now, we thought this is to
be purely a trades union meeting, for the purpose of putting
before the people the principles of industrial unionism. More
than that, we considered also something of the wrangle, something
of the ill feeling that has characterized certain sections
represented in the convention, and for that reason we thought it
best that certain names be left off the program. These matters
were talked over, perhaps with some energy, during that
committee&rsquo;s session. I want to say, however, that so far as
the members of that committee were concerned, we did not
participate in that spirit. The only question which we asked
ourselves was, as to what names would contribute most largely to
the success of that meeting, and we decided accordingly. Now, if
three more names are added to the list of speakers furnished by
the committee, it simply means that every man&rsquo;s time will
be cut to such a short limit that he will be unable to enter into
details and give this meeting what the people ought to have and
what they expect.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Mr. Chairman, I desire to have my name
taken off there, as I am not a candidate; but I want to say that
this committee, in my opinion, does not represent the big end of
what they call this wrangle, and I see in their report a direct
slur at the Socialist Trade &amp; Labor Alliance, and
particularly at Brother De Leon, who has fought so valiantly for
this economic organization. This ratification meeting is for the
purpose of showing that at last the workers have got together on
the common ground of an economic organization of the working
class. Brother De Leon through thick and thin has stood for an
economic organization of the working class when to stand for it
was to be denounced by the entire American Fakiration of Labor
from New York to San Francisco, and if any one in this convention
represents an uncompromising fight for an economic organization
such as we hope to establish here, that one is Brother De Leon.
(Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. RIORDAN: I want to ask the committee a question. Very
recently I saw where Eugene V. Debs was wanted in Montana. I
would like to ask the committee if they have any assurance that
he will be here on Friday evening. If not, it appears to me that
we should make some arrangement to have some one to speak in his
stead; that is, if we are to decide on adopting the report of the
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. Sauer: I will state, in answer to that question, that the
committee was practically, while not positively, assured that Mr.
Debs would be here on Thursday night, and that he would be in the
convention on Friday and that he would be at the meeting on
Friday night. Although the committee is not in a position to
guarantee to this convention that Mr. Debs will be here, I
believe and it is the belief of the committee that he will be
here.</p>
<p>DEL. Bradley: As a member of the committee makes the statement
that Delegate Debs represents the radical element, I, as one of
the radical element, do not believe that Debs represents our
ideas at all. I believe he represents the conservative element in
this convention; for that reason I do not think he is a
representative at all.</p>
<p>DEL. M. P. HAGGERTY, BUTTE: I am in favor of the proposed
addition of the names read by this brother here; not on account
of the names of the men, but on account of the intellect that
they possess. It seems to me that if there is one thing that the
laboring man in this country needs to-day, that one thing is a
man or men with intellect enough to lead the people right. I
believe our past history has conclusively proved that it has been
a case of the blind leading the blind, and so we all fall into
the ditch. We want intelligence in the labor movement; not men
who have got only ordinary intelligence. We want the best we can
get, and prejudice and personal feelings should be cut entirely
out of this, and let us take the men who are capable of teaching,
capable of instructing, giving us more knowledge, which is
something that we are hunting for. If De Leon or Hagerty or
anybody else has got this knowledge to give, then I say that
prejudice should not keep those men from teaching the people. Let
us have the best we have, got, and that is none too good.
(Applause)</p>
<p>DEL. Luella Twining: I do not want to take part in any
factional strife. I am very anxious to hear Debs and the other
speakers, but I think the people that come here will want to hear
Delegate De Leon. I would like to hear him, and I think his name
ought to be added to the list of speakers.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I move to amend that the list of speakers be
Eugene V. Debs, Daniel De Leon, Brother T. J. Hagerty, Brother
Coates, and so on along down the line as the committee has
recommended. I forget the names&mdash;Brothers Moyer and Sherman.
I move that as an amendment.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I move that the name of Thomas J. Hagerty be added
to the list of names of speakers.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is already covered by the amendment. You
have heard the amendment offered by the delegate over here. Your
amendment to the amendment is out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. JAMES SMITH: I believe it would be to the benefit of the
meeting to have Mr. De Leon as a speaker at this mass meeting;
not because he represents one faction in this convention, but
because he represents the cause for which we have come here.
Therefore I hope and trust that the delegates assembled in this
convention will be consistent enough and broad enough in not only
asking but insisting on him, if possible, to be there as a
speaker to address them on that evening.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment is that the names of Delegates De
Leon, Hagerty, Haywood and Sherman be added to the list selected
by the committee. Are you ready for the question? (Question
called for). Those in favor of the amendment will signify it by
saying aye. Contrary no. The amendment is carried. Now, what do
you desire to do with the report of your committee as
amended?</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the report be concurred in.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the report of the committee be adopted as amended. Are you ready
for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I shall have to ask the convention at this
time&mdash;I do not think any explanation on my part is
necessary&mdash;that my name be taken from the list of speakers.
I have a reason for this, but I do not care to go into details
with the convention. I would ask that my name be taken from the
list of speakers. I do not want to be arbitrary and insist that
it be taken from the list, but I ask that the convention do
that.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Is the motion before the house for discussion
again?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion before the house is to adopt the
report of the committee as the list of names has been amended.
Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Now, I voted against that amendment for this
reason: I believe that the list of speakers should include one
name, one individual rather, representing the Western Federation
of Miners, one representing the American Labor Union, and one
speaker representing the American Labor Union, and one speaker
representing the Socialist sentiment of this organization,
believing that three speakers will be plenty for one meeting.
Therefore I voted against the amendment. Believing that still, I
am now opposed to the report as amended, and I hope that the good
sense and judgment of this meeting will try to limit the list of
speakers. We know that there are very few men that have the
faculty of expressing very much to a large audience in the short
period of time which will be allotted to them if you have a great
number of speakers. I hope you will act along this line;
otherwise I will have to vote against the amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: Mr. Chairman, the committee on mass
meeting thoroughly discussed and thrashed out the very
proposition that is before the convention this very minute. The
committee would have been glad to have selected all the gentlemen
who are now mentioned by the various gentlemen in this
convention. In addition to that, Mother Jones was talked of as
being one of those speakers, and nearly every one of the names
that have been mentioned was talked of by this committee. The
committee, however, believed that it would be impossible to hold
the crowd for more than about two hours or two hours and a half
at the outside, and that each one of those speakers probably
would consume about thirty minutes. Starting at eight
o&rsquo;clock, which was agreed upon by the committee, it would
hold the meeting until about ten o&rsquo;clock. Now, then, if we
are to add four more speakers to this proposition, neither one of
the speakers will have an opportunity to do anymore than simply
pledge his support, without any explanation of what industrial
unionism is to the people who come here, thus doing, in my
opinion as the chairman of that committee, an injustice to the
people who come here for the purpose of hearing something about
industrial unionism. Those men who have been selected are the men
who are presidents and chief representatives of the different
organizations that are going to become a part of this
organization and who will put their organizations into this new
organization, and those are the men that we want to have the
assurance of as the chief officials of the three organizations
mentioned, such as the Western Federation of Miners, the American
Labor Union and the United Metal Workers&rsquo; International
Union. They are the men that represent the largest portion of
this proposition, the chief proportion of the new organization,
and it was the intention of the committee to have those men give
their views upon the industrial union proposition; and the
committee went to the trouble of seeing the three of them who are
here, and we hope to correspond or get in communication with Mr.
Debs by wire as to whether he will be here or not, and in the
event of Mr. Debs not coming, the committee expect to substitute
some one else. But it strikes me that by putting on this large
list of speakers at this meeting neither one of the speakers will
do the organization or himself justice.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A matter of information. In several
conversations that I have had with Brother Debs in the last two
weeks he personally stated to me that it was his desire to appear
on the same platform in a ratification meeting with Brother De
Leon on this question. (Applause). I also state that I have
withdrawn my name from that list and am not a candidate.</p>
<p>DEL. ROBINSON: I shall vote against the report of the
committee, for I do not believe that it is the sentiment of the
convention. I would like to see the speakers&rsquo; selected by
the delegates to this convention.</p>
<p>DEL. PHIL. VEAL: We as members of the working class have come
here for a purpose. That purpose is to line up along the line of
solidarity. Now; then, from now on there is no A. L. U., there is
no Western Federation of Miners, neither is there a Socialist
Trade &amp; Labor Alliance. We merge what is known by those names
into the industrial union. But we must profit by the experience
of the past, where men have fought for this idea that we are
about to launch. The men and women who come here, many of them,
have listened to some of these speakers before, but as a wage
slave of the mines I want to get the expression of Haywood, I
want to see Moyer, and I want to see all these men who have
fought, and I want to see Comrade De Leon. I have never heard
them before an audience nor in this convention. Hence we must get
them on a platform, and recognize the fact that the American
proletariat of this age has put them on record where they clasp
the hand, not only of international industrial unionism, but the
hand of solidarity, pledging themselves to the workingmen of
Chicago that from now on they will fight under the same banner.
(Applause). We demand as workingmen that these men be given a
place. We won&rsquo;t solve the problem or educate the workingmen
in <em>one</em> meeting. It has got to be fought out with the
organizers and the agitators when they leave this convention
hall. We want to have that spirit of solidarity so engrafted into
the minds of the working class of this city to start with that it
is beyond the breath of suspicion that here is any prejudice.
Hence I stand absolutely for the support of the amendment which
says that we shall add these four names.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: It has been carried.</p>
<p>DEL. VEAL: I stand for that proposition that we add these
comrades, and refuse absolutely to allow Comrade Moyer to
withdraw from this list, because we want to see these men face to
face, and I express the sentiments of the men who sent me
here.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: A point of information. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a
good idea to have another meeting Saturday night and allow these
men to express themselves? I believe there are a great many
people here in Chicago who would be glad to come back two nights
to hear the expressions of these people on the principles of
industrial unionism.</p>
<p>DEL. CRANSTON: I think we ought to have about three meetings.
Delegate Schatzke is all right. Any speaker that gets on the
platform cannot expect to cover the question so that it will be
understood by the mass of the people that come here, under thirty
or forty minutes, possibly longer. We took Brother Debs,
believing that he as a trades unionist was in a position to
explain all that was necessary. There is no objection, I think,
on the part of the committee to adding Brother De Leon, but we
cannot have too many speakers because it will not permit any one
to do full justice to the subject. I do not think the committee
would object to De Leon&rsquo;s name being added, but I do not
think the convention ought to put on more than one more if we
want to give them all time to speak. There will be hundreds of
people coming to this meeting to hear this question discussed,
and I do not think it would be just and fair to allow the
speakers&rsquo; time to be cut down as you have suggested.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I move as a substitute for the report of this
committee that this convention select the speakers and the order
in which they are to speak.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUER: I want to understand what this ratification
meeting is for. Is it to explain industrial unionism to the
people, the crowd who will be here at the meeting, or is it to
show that all the factions on this floor are united?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The word &ldquo;ratification&rdquo; suggests
that it is for the purpose of showing that we are united.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: I would like to ask if this committee was not
given full power to act in regard to the speakers, soliciting for
the hall, advertising and so on? If I understand the thing right,
they had full power to act, and with that understanding this
convention should abide by the decision of the committee. If they
don&rsquo;t want to do that, I say discharge the committee and
appoint the speakers at this time, right here. I make that as an
amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Before the motion is put the chair wants to say
this to the convention, that the name of Haywood will have to be
taken from the list, as I expect the work of this convention will
be concluded before that time and I will not be in the city.
However, it will be necessary for President Moyer to remain here,
and I am in hopes that the convention will not find it in their
wisdom to permit him, unless he insists upon it, to withdraw his
name from that list of speakers, because he can tell you many
things that will be of interest to the industrial union movement,
representing, as he does, one of the most perfect industrial
organizations in this country. The motion is to adopt&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Before the motion is put I want to tell the
convention that I will be very glad to give any time that may be
allotted to me to the other speakers that have been
mentioned.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Are we to vote on this report as amended with the
names of Hagerty and Haywood omitted?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You are to vote on the motion as amended.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Was my substitute out of order? I think it was
seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the report of your committee, and
it was amended by adding four names. Delegate Hagerty requests
that his name be withdrawn, and I request that my name be
withdrawn.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I had hoped that this convention would give me the
consideration that I asked for and take my name from the list of
speakers. I will have now to say to the convention that it will
be impossible for me to speak in this hall on Friday evening. I
do not want to disappoint anybody by permitting my name to be
included in this list of speakers, when I am satisfied at this
time that I will not be able to address a meeting here on Friday
night. I desire to see the Western Federation of Miners
represented on this list of speakers, and I would ask that the
name of James A. Baker, of British Columbia, be placed on the
list of speakers.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion occurs on the report of your
committee amended. Those in favor will signify it by saying aye.
Contrary no. The proposition is to add the two names, Trautmann
and De Leon, to the report of the committee. Those in favor of
the report as amended will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no.
The ayes seem to have it; the motion is carried.</p>
<p>DELEGATE PAYMENT: It would be wise to have an understanding
now as to whether Brother Moyer is to speak or Brother Baker. He
asked that he be excused and have in his place Brother Baker, of
British Columbia.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The request will have to be arranged with the
committee. &mdash;Reports of standing committees. The
Constitution Committee, on Section 2 of Article I.</p>
<h4>DEBATE ON CONSTITUTION.</h4>
<p>DEL. COATES: Do I understand that we are to vote for now?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Sir?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: As I understand it, the debate and argument was
closed last night, and we now vote.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, sir.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, now, of course I do not want to continue to
be interrupted on a proposition of this kind. I am willing to
leave it to the rules of the convention or to the convention, as
far as that is concerned, but certainly&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: A point of order. I understood the chair to
announce yesterday afternoon that everybody was to speak that
desired to on that question, and that Delegate Coates was to make
his closing argument. He did so, and he closed and the convention
adjourned at that time.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I believe Brother Coates stated that he desired
the floor after all the delegates had spoken who wanted to, and
that he would be given the privilege of the floor to close.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: I move you that we have a further extension of
time to discuss the matter. (Seconded).</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and
seconded&mdash;it occurs to me that there is no occasion for a
motion.</p>
<p>DEL. Klemensic: Well.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If there is any delegate that desires to speak
on the question he may.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I haven&rsquo;t objection to anybody speaking. If
we are going to open up this debate again I am gong to claim the
right of the mover of the motion. I want to make another speech,
too. I want that thing understood before this thing is opened
up.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you make a motion for further debate?</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: That further discussion on Section 2, Article
I., of the constitution be allowed.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Does the chair entertain that motion?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: In view of the ruling of the chair in my absence
yesterday, the chair will entertain this motion that there be
further discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Do I understand you will entertain a motion to
suspend the rules and have discussion?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: To suspend the rules and open up this question
for discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: A point of order. My point of order is that the
rules were suspended yesterday, and when the rules were suspended
the delegate who then had the close was given unlimited time, and
I had the floor to ask some question, and at that point the
convention adjourned. The rules are suspended now, and the
subject is no longer open under the rules. That is my
understanding.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If that is the understanding of the convention,
motion&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I would like to have a ruling from the chair. My
point of order is that upon the vote of this convention the rules
were suspended, the convention adjourned, and consequently we are
no longer discussing under the rules. I would like to get a
ruling upon that. I simply request a ruling from the chair,
without any debate from the floor. Is that correct, Mr.
Chairman?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is correct.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I am opposed to that kind of snap judgment. I
simply want to call your attention to this rule. The rule shows
that my time was extended by the convention; the rules have not
been suspended absolutely, no.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: The motion was to suspend the rules.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: The motion reads that the rules be suspended
and Delegate Coates be given an extension of time, and the motion
carried.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: According to the rules governing bodies, when
that session adjourned that session ends. We did not recess last
night; we adjourned till this morning, and with that the session
ends and, the rules operate again. The rule was only suspended
during yesterday. If we had recessed till nine o&rsquo;clock this
morning this suspension would still have been in effect, but the
convention adjourned and this is a new session.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: In the opinion of the chair, Section 2, Article
I. occupies the same position as if there had been no discussion
on it. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I just want to ask for information. The position
of the chair is that I have a right to close the debate?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have the right to close the debate.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: That is all.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: The only reason I take the floor is that I
consider the matter under discussion&mdash;Section 2 and the
Coates amendment&mdash;infinitely more important than the matter
of a name, and I do not believe it is the purpose of the
committee to railroad anything through this convention. It cannot
be our purpose, nor do I believe it is the purpose of those
opposed to the proposition of the committee to carry anything
high-handedly, by force of votes. I proceed upon the theory that
we all desire that when this convention adjourns we can all be
agreed, if not upon the wisdom of what was done, nevertheless
agreed upon what was actually done. After the address of Delegate
Coates it was clear to me that whichever way the vote
went&mdash;and I have no doubt as to how that vote will
go&mdash;whichever way the vote went, there would be a vast
amount of misconception upon what was voted, or upon what the
committee actually proposed. For that reason I took the floor,
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and the condition of the
convention, to ask Delegate Coates the questions that I did, and
get the answers which I needed for my argument.</p>
<p>I asked Delegate Coates whether I understood him correctly,
that he believed that his proposed substitute will not materially
affect the structure proposed by the committees and I understood
him to say&mdash;you are my judges whether I report him correctly
or not&mdash;I understood him to say that, while he did not want
to be bound down by any set of words, that that was his
impression. I shall show you that the Coates amendment would
smash the structure proposed by your committee. Right here let me
say that it is no argument against an argument that a brick
proposed to be substituted would smash the structure of the
committee. That is no argument against such a brick. It may be a
desirable thing to smash that structure. The structure of the
committee may be wrong; the brick proposed to be substituted by
Delegate Coates may be a good brick; and if so made clear, I am
sure that the committee jointly with the convention will join
hands in smashing that structure. But it is well that when that
proposed brick is voted on we vote on it with a clear knowledge
as to what its effect will be. I repeat that it is of itself, no
argument against Delegate Coates&rsquo;s brick that it would
smash the structure proposed by the committee; but we should know
whether it will or not. It won&rsquo;t do to vote for that brick,
or favor that brick thinking it to be an innocent brick, and that
it will not smash the structure, and then find that the brick was
full of dynamite and that it brings the structure down over our
ears. If that is understood I shall proceed.</p>
<p>I asked Delegate Coates how many industrial unions and
industrial international unions he thinks would have to go into
that body according to his proposition. He did not answer me, but
I do not need him for that. Delegate Smith, who stands with
Delegate Coates upon that matter, did not have to indulge in
astronomical calculations about the next 4th of July to come to a
conclusion. He stated, as I remember, that he thinks the number
of industrial international and national unions would not be to
exceed sixteen.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that it?</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I said I did not think to exceed
twenty.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: That it would not exceed twenty. Very well, I
accept that. He at any rate stated a figure. Now we have
something to go by. I disagree with Delegate Smith that it would
not exceed twenty. I am of the opinion that twenty is about
one-half the number that would have to be entered on the list. I
believe that forty is nearer to the truth, to the correct number,
than twenty. Aye, twice as many as forty. Now, I shall take his
position presently, but follow my theory for the present. If I am
right that the present constitution of the unions will make it
impossible to have only twenty of these organizations&mdash;if I
am right that it will take at least forty, what will be the
result? The structure of the committee is industrialism. But
industrialism is not a thing of one thing only. Industrialism
means a number of things, and among the things that industrialism
means is the establishment of an organization so centralized that
it can act quickly and as one man. Whatever name you give to
something else&mdash;call it a thousand times
industrialism&mdash;if it is not so centralized that it will act
promptly, that it can act promptly and as one man, the name of
industrialism given to it is a snare and a delusion. Now, then,
if I am right that it will take at least forty, is it imaginable
that the presidents of these forty international and national
unions can constitute a central authority sufficiently
centralized to preserve that feature of the structure proposed by
the committee? I say no. Forty men is too large a number. You
cannot have centralized authority with forty men. This is no
longer a matter open to discussion, it is a matter established by
human experience. A deliberative body is one thing, an executive
body another. You want a smaller body than that to accomplish
executive purposes. But now, suppose that, in order to save that
feature of industrialism, you, instead of having all the
presidents of these forty national and international industrial
unions represented, you reduce them below that number, to a
number of members of an Executive Board small enough to preserve
that centralized and executive power&mdash;where do we land? We
land right back into the A. F. of L. principle where many of the
organizations that are considered integral parts of the whole are
not represented, but are wholly ignored on the Executive Board.
On the executive board of Gompers organization you have seven
men, and you have industrial, national and autonomous unions
galore, notwithstanding that, only seven men, only seven officers
of seven of these &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; bodies, act as the
executive board. A preposterous idea! For an executive board, an
effective industrial executive board, it must not only be a small
body, but it must be a body consisting of individuals who
directly represent their respective constituencies.. My theory is
that at least forty such industrial bodies would be needed by the
Coates plan. If my theory is right, then you are before this
dilemma: either an Executive Board that has no centralized power
and won&rsquo;t have it on account of its numbers; or, if you
want to reduce the number, they cease to be direct
representatives. But perhaps my theory is wrong. Perhaps Delegate
Smith&rsquo;s theory is correct, that the number would not exceed
twenty. I ask you to watch and follow me closely; I am willing to
be pinned down to my words; I believe in a man being held to what
he says, otherwise we tumble into hopelessly unintelligible
confusion. If I am mistaken I shall be glad to be corrected, and
if you want to find out my mistake follow me closely. I now take
up the theory of Delegate Smith that it will need no more than
twenty international unions as a maximum. What will be the
result? Just watch. The unions are to-day absolutely
interdependent; labor has become interdependent; you cannot think
of any one trade but it dove-tails with. another, and is, in turn
dove-tailed with by others. Take for instance the Western
Federation of Miners; all the men working around the mines,
whether they are directly engaged in digging ore or not, are
working interdependently, and so are the unions of the crafts.
You all know&mdash;I hope you do&mdash;that there are infinitely
more unions, national and international, than twenty. It follows
that under the Smith figures and the Coates proposed brick, there
will have to be an immediate wiping out of the individual
character and autonomy of at least sixty organizations. Under the
Smith figure and the Coates system you would then have twenty
organizations, twenty national or international unions, and these
twenty national or international unions would have to draw to
themselves rapidly, quickly, without any period of transition,
all the other unions that are over and in excess of that number,
and which have kindred qualities with the prevailing twenty. That
is a most drastic proposition. It leaves no time for transition.
Those men will have to go in immediately, or if not immediately,
whenever they do go in they find absolutely no autonomy for their
trade. They disappear. It may be compositors and machinists; it
may be woodworkers and carpenters, if you like; it may be
electricians and mechanical workers, whose work dove-tails very
extensively. Nevertheless, those organizations exist to-day, and
under that system their autonomy will vanish absolutely,
destroying the quality of their occupation which compels and
necessitates the continuity of that autonomy. Now, that is a
drastic method. Now, what does the committee propose? Delegate
Coates asked, &ldquo;What do you want? Do you want to rule your
individuals as a mass, or do you want them separated as
locals?&rdquo; Or would you have this or that or the other?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Your time is up.</p>
<p>DEL. JACKSON: I move that Delegate De Leon&rsquo;s time be
extended as provided for by the rules. (Seconded by Delegate
Coates).</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Under the ruling it is not necessary to have this
motion. According to the ruling of the chair here the rules were
suspended yesterday. You sustained that decision this morning,
and it is not necessary for the motion at the present time.
Delegate De Leon has the floor until he is done speaking.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question is that the time of Brother De Leon
be extended. Those in favor of the motion signify it by saying
aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I do not want to consider this motion as a
personal compliment to me. I wish to consider that in voting as
you have just done you simply realize that it is important that
you should know what you are voting for. (Applause) Delegate
Coates asked this question: &ldquo;What do you propose? Do you
propose this or that or the other?&rdquo; There was no occasion
for any such questions. The committee&rsquo;s proposition is
clear on that head. The only explanation I can find for those
questions is the difficulty of any person&rsquo;s remembering a
long document which he hears read only once. Now, what does the
committee propose? Among the things that the committee proposes
is that within each of these industrial organizations into which
these various unions are subdivided there shall exist a number of
executive boards. The proposition is&mdash;I quote from memory,
from the fact that I heard it read only once in the
committee&mdash;that there shall not be fewer than five of
them.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Seven.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Seven, and not fewer than seven. So that there
is a possibility of there being at least three times seven, or
twenty-one sub-heads of the general executive committee, these
sub-heads constituting within each of these thirteen departments,
the requisite craft executive boards. Now, what does that mean?
For each of these sub-divisions there are a number of individuals
representing the executives of what? Of a mob? Preposterous! Not
of a mob;&mdash;representing these various existing craft
organizations; these various craft organizations which are the
result of the capitalist sub-division of labor. It means,
consequently, following closely what the Manifesto says&mdash;and
when I say Manifesto, I mean exactly what I say. I quote from the
text, not from the wheel, so that no one afterwards may say that
the wheel has anything to do with it. The written words of the
text of the Manifesto provide here, on page 5 (reading) &ldquo;A
movement fulfilling these conditions must consist of a great
industrial union embracing all industries, providing for craft
autonomy locally, industrial autonomy internationally, and
working class unity generally.&rdquo; That the committee proposes
sub-executive boards within each of the divisions, is a complete
answer to the various questions put by Delegate Coates. It shows
that the committee proposes that the different crafts within each
of the main divisions shall organize upon craft lines in
sub-divisions, and that the heads of these sub-divisions shall be
assembled in sub boards. It means that the committee proposes to
put an end to what is harmful in the existing craft
organizations, putting executive boards over them, chosen by
themselves. They will administer their own affairs, according to
the language of this Manifesto, and they will jointly elect one
member to the general executive board. That removes what I
consider the largest part of the confusion created,
unintentionally, by Delegate Coates, and arising from his not
having remembered this passage. When he closes I hope he will
answer directly upon this, whether or not these sub-executive
boards of crafts do not absolutely deny the impression that he
attempted to convey. Should he still he of his former opinion, I
would like to know the reason why. and I invite you to follow his
answer closely when he closes. I recognize that these divisions
are not ideal. One of them or two of them are; the others are
not. But there Delegate Hall well expressed the sentiment of the
committee, and, I hope, of this convention when he said that we
must begin to take a step some time. Now, the committee proposes
a scheme through these subexecutive boards which would leave time
for these craft organizations to amalgamate wherever amalgamation
is possible. The proposition of the committee, consequently, is a
sane proposition; it is a practical proposition. And this
proposition of the committee is decried as a wild theory,
notwithstanding its practicability; and the Coates
proposition&mdash;the craziest of propositions, namely, to
suggest that you just squeeze and mutilate and pound those crafts
within the number of twenty, without any provision for the
separate arrangement of the crafts in different
managements&mdash;that proposition it is here attempted to be
palmed off as &ldquo;practical!&rdquo; I hold that the views
Delegate Coates expressed are a natural result of what is my
contention with regard to his general position&mdash;he fails to
understand that constitution.</p>
<p>One of the questions I asked Delegate Coates was this, whether
I understood him right with regard to what he said on the matter
of railroad companies and the like. He said I was wrong. I have
here the transcript from the stenographer. This is exactly what
he said: (reading) &ldquo;Whenever capital goes into the railroad
business it organizes a railroad company, and the railroad
companies, variously as they are grouped together, come together
as railroad companies. Whenever the same men who are interested
in these railway companies want to go into the newspaper business
they organize a separate company and go into the newspaper
business.&rdquo; Now, listen: &ldquo;AND THAT COMPANY HAS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RAILROAD BUSINESS.&rdquo; Now,
that statement I consider to be an unqualified blindness to the
facts. There is not one single capitalist organization,
capitalist concern, capitalist board of directors, but embraces a
dozen or more different industries. (Applause). When capitalists
come together to organize a newspaper, perforce it is a newspaper
that they are going to set up, but to say that they have
absolutely nothing to do with the railroad business is to ignore
a glaring fact,&mdash;by this time, you see, the gentleman has
gone beyond the domain of &ldquo;theory&rdquo; and has run foul
of the field of facts. If capitalists want to organize a
newspaper business, a newspaper company, they look for railroad
magnates, for mining magnates, for factory magnates, for
financial magnates, and they come together; ostensibly for a
newspaper, but <em>de facto</em> to promote the interests of
these industries that are amalgamated within or behind that mask
of a newspaper. (Applause). Time was that when we Socialists said
these things we were said to he &ldquo;wild-eyed men.&rdquo; I
think the time has come when Delegate Coates should know from
experience and from facts that he can gather from the capitalist
press, that we are not &ldquo;wild-eyed men.&rdquo; Look at what
is going on in New York, now. Capitalists had met to organize an
insurance company&mdash;an INSURANCE company, mind you. And what
are the facts that are now being unearthed? There is not a
banking trust, there is not a railroad trust, there is not a
Standard Oil interest, there is hardly a factory industry, but is
represented on that board of directors; an examination of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society proves that what they have there
is ostensibly a &ldquo;life insurance association,&rdquo; but de
facto a means by which to gather money for the industries that
each of these various directors represents. (Applause). Is it
&ldquo;insurance&rdquo; that takes Depew there? Is it
&ldquo;insurance&rdquo; that takes there the man who owns the
stocks of the Fall River weaving mills? Oh, no! It is something
entirely different. There is a book that I recommend to all of
you. It is not a book with a yellow cover; yet it is thrilling
enough for yellow covers, although its cover is red. It is called
the &ldquo;Directory of Directors.&rdquo; It is a publication
from the capitalist camp. It gives a list of the directors in the
leading industries of the United States, and the leading
corporations of the country. In it you will find innumerable
instances of men who pose as directors in one concern and are
directors in half a dozen others. Few comparatively are the
instances of importance in which a man is a director in one
concern alone. Those men pick themselves out and elect themselves
and each other, here out of the railroad business, there out of
some other business, but all with an eye to the interests of the
various industries that they represent. The capitalist system has
reached a point where it is no longer a lot of little individual
blisters; it is one general blister. (Applause). The theory upon
which this committee has proceeded is that the working class
should be organized as one body, without ignoring the necessary
craft sub-division. We recognized the fact of the different
trades, the different tools that they have to use, and we look to
the ultimate ideals, the absolute amalgamation, but we recognize
the necessity of a period of transition, and the
committee&rsquo;s proposition provides for a period of
transition. I do not believe that that period of transition will
be very long; I do not share the opinion of Delegate Coates that
the ideal of ultimate emancipation lies distantly remote&mdash;a
thousand years or so.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I did not say a thousand years.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: You stated it would be a thousand years and
more, to the very day.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Not a thousand years.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: A hundred years?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: You stated a thousand, I think. If there were
time I would look for it in the stenographer&rsquo;s report. I
understood you to say that, to the very day. But let it go at a
hundred. Even that I consider a serious error, however sincere
the error may be. It is a harmful error. Delegate Coates has
repeatedly assured us of the loyalty of his intentions; but the
best of intentions do not preclude a person&rsquo;s acting
wrongly&mdash;though, perhaps, not wrongfully. It is wrong to
place the ultimate consummation of this movement into the remote
distant future. If you want to encourage a tired man you do not
tell him that the goal of his trip lies innumerable hours thence.
At times you may even have to imitate Columbus: you tell the man
that the goal is near, and you give him courage, and add
elasticity to his step. Do not deceive him. Do not make him think
that the goal is near when the goal is away out of sight.</p>
<p>But, as I stated and explained on the third day of this
convention, I hold that the goal IS IN SIGHT. (Applause).
Consequently I consider it wrong to conduct ourselves as though
the goal were indefinitely far off. I hold that the proposition
of the committee is correct. It takes in the situation and its
nearby possibilities. I believe that the committee, as one man,
will join Delegate Coates or anybody else if he can propose a
better method. But unless a better method is proposed, unless a
method is proposed which is agreeable to facts, not to
fancies&mdash;unless that is proposed, I for one shall stick to
the proposition of that committee. And since the debate has been
opened and the rules have been suspended I shall listen carefully
and attentively with no hobby to ride, or ill temper. When I
yesterday asked my questions to Delegate Coates he went to pieces
and forgot his exquisite parliamentary manners. The occasion is
solemn. It demands cool judgment. We want that when we adjourn
from this body, those who have fought&mdash;for it is a
fight&mdash;against a thing, may, although not agreed in their
action, be agreed upon what was done. (Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman and Delegates, as one of that
committee I will state that with all of the arguments that have
been put forth, both on the floor of this convention and in
conversations that I have heard on the street, I have as yet not
changed my mind. While I will agree with Brother De Leon that
perhaps the plan partially may be not a success, yet I feel at
this time that the plan outlined is the best that can be done for
a start; and whatever I may say in opposition to any arguments
that may be put forth by any of those who participate, I
seriously hope and trust that no delegates will feel that I am
addressing them personally. I am speaking to the principle, and
no matter how this fight goes, when I leave this hall I shall
have the same love and respect for those that oppose me as I have
for those who are with me. (Applause). There is a principle
involved that we must all adhere to, and while we may be divided
on opinions we must be united on action. (Applause). A few
remarks were made by the brother who preceded me, referring to
those who took issue with the proposition. If this amendment
prevails it would practically mean that this convention is not
prepared to state what the lines would be in the industrial
movement, but it would be left to some other committee&mdash;I do
not know where they are going to select them from, some one that
is wiser than this committee or this convention&mdash;to lay out
the lines of what industrial unionism shall be. It means a longer
deliberation than what this whole convention will be and the only
way that I can see that the committee could reach any conclusion
would be to go among the various trade unionists and get their
various opinions and then outline as to what they believe would
meet with the approval of the trade unionists of the United
States. Which would mean what? It would mean multiplying forty by
three. It would not be forty divisions that would meet the
approval of the trade unionists of the United States. There are
one hundred and twenty-seven distinct divisions and charters now
standing out, issued by the American Federation of Labor. In
several of those organizations to-day there are arguments being
put forth by men who claim to be posted on the trade union
movement that they should be re-subdivided and charters issued to
different trade unions that are represented in the one hundred
and twenty-seven. If we are going to be industrial unionists and
we are going to expand greater than thirteen, I feel that we
should strike out the name &ldquo;industrial unionism&rdquo; and
not represent ourselves to be that which it would not represent.
(Applause). Brother Coates is a printer. First of all I will say
that I am confident that he has traveled several thousand miles
to reach this convention with the right heart. He is here with
the spirit of brotherhood, to do something to emancipate the
producing class. I know that he is here honest and earnest, and
in the argument that he makes against this proposition he
personally believes that he is right. I concede that he has got a
right to his opinion. He represents the printers, and his
contention is that the printers should have an organization of
their own. There is an organization of that class existing at the
present time. Does Brother Coates know that the printers
don&rsquo;t work in a way that they can be identified as an
industrial organization? Does Brother Coates realize that the
printing of this country is done by a printing establishment?
Does Brother Coates realize that at the great meat strike in
Chicago not many months ago there were over a hundred printers in
the printing department of the packing industries that were not
included in the packers strike? Does Brother Coates realize that
in the meat industries, the packing industries, they are also
running laundries? They are in the laundry business, yet they are
in the industrial packers&rsquo; business because they do work
for the packing industry. They have restaurants too, if you
please, in the same industry. Does Brother Coates not realize
that under the proposition that he offers here it is nothing more
than purely and simply what we have got at the present
time&mdash;what we are assembled here to tear down?</p>
<p>(Great applause). Last November at Montgomery Ward&rsquo;s
plant all the garment workers walked out into the streets of
Chicago and declared a strike. It took some four months to defeat
that strike. After the garment workers had been annihilated and
defeated the teamsters that were working in the same industry
came to the conclusion that they should have assisted the garment
workers.</p>
<p>Those are the kind of decisions that the employers like.
&ldquo;Just let us get at you one at a time and we will skin you
to a finish.&rdquo; That is their proposition. (Applause). If the
garment working industry were organized on the industrial system
there could not have been one man or woman, whether he or she be
driving a team, running a sewing machine or working a hand
needle, but what would have stopped work and at once have
paralyzed that industry. But under Brother Coates&rsquo;s
proposition, before anything of that kind could be done,
conciliation must be brought about between five or six executive
heads, just as we have got them at the present time. I would not
object if somebody would make a motion to strike out the thirteen
lines and make it three. (Applause). What is a mechanic? He is a
slave; he is nothing; he is a workingman. I do not recognize one
man to be any different than another. He is only one cog in the
wheel that goes to make up the general machinery that grinds out
the product. (Applause). And I care not whether it requires two
or three years to become an efficient mechanic, or whether he is
only the common laborer that comes across the water and all he
can do is to pick up the shovel and dig and excavate for the
factory that is going to accommodate the employes; it is just the
same to me. (Applause). There is no particular business at the
present time. Take the transportation department, as the
Pennsylvania Company, go up to Monroe street, and on the sidewalk
there you find a line of cabs that it has been decided by the
City Council belongs to the Pennsylvania Company, that has a full
right to the streets of Chicago to stand there to accommodate the
people that the Pennsylvania Company, that furnishes transfers,
that they may go to other points or to go to other depots. Go
right into the depot; there we find the terminus of the
Pennsylvania Railroad; follow it all the way down, with every
slave and every one that works for that company as a part of that
corporation, away on to Jersey City, and there we find the
Pennsylvania with a great monster vessel backed in there, and
there the passengers of the Pennsylvania are put onto that boat
and transported across. Many of them are going to foreign
countries, and they go on a Pennsylvania line because the
Pennsylvania people have got lines that run to various ports in
Europe. Away the Pennsylvania Company goes to the foreign ports,
and you don&rsquo;t stop there, but they have their agents that
go out representing them and misrepresenting the conditions in
this country, and they go into Ireland, they go into Wales, they
go into Sweden and in all of the congested ports, and there they
misrepresent to them the golden harvests they have in America,
and if they come over here they travel by the Pennsylvania lines.
It is one straight system all the way through, representing
nearly every industry.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Your time is up.</p>
<p>DEL. TRAUTMANN: I move you that Brother Sherman be granted the
same privilege as other delegates who have spoken; that his time
be extended.</p>
<p>Motion seconded by Delegate Simons.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: To settle this whole business, I move that each
speaker be allowed to speak till he finishes. (Seconded).</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved that every speaker be allowed
to speak till he has concluded.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I am opposed to that for the reason that the
majority of what was said by the two speakers that have just
spoken on the subject seemed to imply that those who are here in
the names of the industrial unions, with the exception of a few,
do not understand all the ramifications of the capitalistic
system, and that in order to awaken our minds to these
ramifications time is wasted in listening to other things that
they are discussing. I for one want to resent that imputation. I
do not believe in it, and I believe&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You are doing pretty well towards a speech
yourself, Brother Murtaugh. The amendment is that each delegate
be allowed to speak until he has concluded. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for).</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRVIEW: I believe that a motion of that kind is
useless. There are something like 251 delegates here, and we
would be here for the next three months if that motion prevails.
I believe each side should have two or three speakers and let
them present the arguments. I am opposed to this motion. We
don&rsquo;t want to sit here for two weeks, when two or three on
each side can explain the situation.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: The that reason I made the motion was to save
time. Every speaker that speaks we are going to give an extension
of time, and it would not be proper if we did not do it, and we
are merely wasting five minutes at least every time in making the
motion, and putting the motion.</p>
<p>The question was put, and the Chairman being in doubt, a vote
by uplifted hands was taken, resulting in forty for the motion
and twenty-four against.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment is carried. The original motion is
that Brother Sherman be allowed an extension of time, and that
other delegates be given time till they conclude their arguments.
Those in favor of the amended motion will signify it by saying
aye. Contrary no. Carried. Brother Sherman will proceed.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: We had the Pennsylvania under discussion. That
is only one of the few combines in this country, and they are
getting fewer; they are pushing out their lines every day.
Pennsylvania also does its printing, under the system of class
organization, the same conditions which exist, no matter if we do
call it by the name of industrial unionism. I don&rsquo;t want
anything called by name, but I want it in operation. We
don&rsquo;t want anything <em>called</em>; we want co-operation
and industrialism a <em>fact</em>. We want the workers to be
working on correct principles and educating themselves to the
fact that there is identity between labor; that they only
represent the producing class. There is too much plutocracy now
in labor, and that is the curse of it at the present time.
(Applause). I do not think that there is a sister or a brother on
the floor of this convention but what realizes that the products
now are handled by corporations and trusts that are so
intermingled that they are practically one organization, no
matter whether it is on the industrial or the political question.
They own and control the power from the fact that the workers are
divided industrially. You unite them industrially, and when they
realize what they can accomplish on those lines there is nothing
impossible on anything that we want to do after that. (Applause).
The powers against labor are nothing. The index finger of the
producing class would push every enemy into the sea. <em>All you
have got to do is to get them all to push at once.</em> The only
enemy that labor has got is labor. Capital never won a strike nor
never won a battle. It was labor, and we must educate labor that
they must turn around and face <em>one way</em>. There never was
but one railroad strike ever won, and that was with an industrial
organization, the A. R. U. (Applause). And it was won against the
opposition of the old brotherhoods and all of the political
trickery that they could bring into line. It was demonstrated at
once when they telegraphed to the seat of the United States
government that &ldquo;transportation was paralyzed, and we want
to place this proposition in your hands, and that you run these
trains with bayonets.&rdquo; When labor is organized right and
educated, they will own the bayonet. (Applause). They make them,
and after they are made and polished and fitted to the weapon
that will do the most destruction you hand them over to the
enemy, and you say, &ldquo;Now I am going back here a few hundred
yards to see if it spits you.&rdquo; Thus far it has given entire
satisfaction. It is a well-known fact that there is a prize
offered to-day to the man who will create or invent a machine
that will destroy the most human lives with a single shot. You
have got all these things to contend with, and I beg of you,
Brother Coates and your friends, for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t
cut off that arm, but put your arm out and come together and work
together. Division does not mean strength. I don&rsquo;t care how
you divide it, it does not mean strength. You have got to unite
them. And I believe that the committee has done as well as any
committee could do under the circumstances. I took into
consideration the Manifesto as we understood that we should work
from it. When I say &ldquo;Manifesto,&rdquo; I want you to
understand that that chart on the back of the Manifesto is not
considered the Manifesto. That chart was not in the conference
when that Manifesto was adopted. That Manifesto was simply given
to a brother who drew it up, and we have given this just as a
little outline or diagram showing the centralization of our
power. I am not unmindful of the fact that there will be in these
various places here thousands of men probably representing one
particular vocation. I am not unmindful also of the fact that
undoubtedly to facilitate matters and to relieve the burden of
this executive board in that department that they will have to
have sub-committees or sub-executive boards; that they will
create those to confer with these people, the same as we have at
the present time. It is a fact that the national organizations
now have their local unions; their local unions have their
sub-bodies; they have their representatives known as business
agents to assess them, like my friend from St. Louis (laughter);
a delegate who, though he is in opposition to that, I love him
and respect him because he was in one of the A. R. U.
organizations which I initiated into the organization. That is
the best redeeming feature I know about him, because he embraced
industrial unionism eleven years ago.</p>
<p>Now, I believe this is misunderstood. I believe that even
Brother Coates has not stopped to consider that it is possible in
the different crafts and in the industrial divisions that they
can be handled to the best interests of the movement, just the
same as the regular army is handled, the infantry, the artillery
and the various parts. Then there are the industrial
organizations co-operating within one certain body; they are
handled by certain divisions, but those divisions come to a head
just as the army does, which makes it possible for united action.
And that is what we have to have, sisters and
brothers&mdash;united action. Now, to change that, to take out
one line, means the adjourning of this convention and the
appointing of another committee, because the committee that
served once would not feel capable of forming anything that was
within reason. Taking out one line or adding one line means the
reconstruction of this whole constitution that has been made,
because that is the basis of the organization; and when you
change that, it is just like undermining a building, and the
whole thing comes down and must be built up again.</p>
<p>Now, Brother Coates and delegates, I think you are right when
you are fearful, and that it will not be possible between now and
the next convention to organize all the workers in any one of
those divisions. You may be all right, if you are afraid that
they will become organized and get disrupted from the fact that
they will have no way of handling each other. But I don&rsquo;t
think, you will see it that way. I think, brothers and sisters,
that bravely as we have started, we will perhaps find places
where changes could be made by the next convention. But for a
start I cannot see or I cannot believe that it would be advisable
or feasible to change that proposition and then call ourselves
and be an industrial organization. Industrial organization, as I
understand it, means that when an industry represented in any
department is involved, it involves every one in that industry.
Whether he is a printer, whether she is a lady that waits on the
table, whether he or she is a laundry worker or a clerk or a
stenographer, if they are in that industry it includes them all.
And the only way that you can have concentrated action and
momentary movement is to have them organized in industries,
regardless of what part of the industry they belong to, so that
when you touch the button the signal goes to every man and woman
in that industry. It is not a question of assembling six or seven
months before and taking action and writing to the high moguls
that belong to the various national organizations and getting
their consent. You don&rsquo;t have to call a board together to
fight and quarrel and consider whether an organization is now in
a position where it would be possible to bring them out on
strike, or whether it would be feasible if they have a contract
that has not expired, as is the condition at the present time. I
tell you, those that are arguing on the proposition of tearing
down this chart or this little outline, I believe they are making
a mistake, and before you go seriously into the matter I hope you
will consider and think what we are trying to do. We are not
trying to please the American Federation of Labor. We know that
we are going to displease them. We know that in the
transportation department we are going to displease the
Switchmen&rsquo;s organization, but we are going to please the
switchmen. We are going to displease the officers of the
trainmen&rsquo;s organization, but many of the rank and file are
going to be pleased. We are going to displease many of the
firemen as officials, and the engineers with &ldquo;the great
proud eagle eye,&rdquo; the one that is known as a national scab
as an organization&mdash;we are going to displease all of those
people, but we are going to please the rank and file, because we
are going to offer them a proposition that they can come in on
one platform and fight in one cause. I hope you will receive it
and ponder it and endorse this proposition as it stands.
(Applause).</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: Brother Chairman and Fellow Delegates, the way
I look at this discussion we are facing two different attitudes
or conditions, if you please. One is practical and the other
theoretical. Now, theoretically, in everything that Brother
Sherman and the other brother said about it, I agree with them.
It is the only way we can bring the ultimate results to a focus
where we want all industrial co-operators. On the other side, we
know the fact that as we stand to-day at this convention the only
properly organized organizations in this convention are
represented by the Western Federation of Miners and the Metal
Workers. Now, as far as I can see, those two organizations are
the only two here in this body. Now, we do want the rest of the
labor organizations in this industrial movement. The question is,
how are we gong to proceed about it? How can we get to the rank
and file and show the rank and file that our conception of
organization will bring immediately and ultimately better results
than the American Federation of Labor? Now, we have to take these
things as practical men, that would come in our daily lives, in
our struggle for every day bread and butter. For my part, I will
read the Manifesto and the statements thereof. In the first
place, &ldquo;All power shall rest in the collective
membership.&rdquo; The question is, how can we bring our
organization to that form whereby we can have all power rest in
the collective membership? This I think we can only have through
an organization locally, that the local organization will have
more latitude to deal with local affairs. Now, we know that the
conditions in the city of Chicago in any given trade are
different than in the rest of Illinois, or maybe the State of
Colorado or other places. Where the congestion of your population
has risen to a high pitch, the state of affairs is different from
where the population is scattered. Now, furthermore, we say,
&ldquo;Local, national and general administration, including
union labels, buttons, badges, transfer cards, initiation fees
and per capita tax, shall be uniform throughout. All members must
hold membership in the local, national or international union
covering the industry in which they are employed, but transfers
of membership between unions, local, national or international,
shall be universal.&rdquo; Now, the point at issue will be this:
I am say a member of the Journeyman Tailors&rsquo; Union. Now, I
do not know whether our Executive Board may be satisfied with the
local tailors&rsquo; union in Pueblo, that we are joining in this
movement. It is certainly against Lennon&rsquo;s advice and his
personal letters as stated to our unions. We referred the case to
the Executive Board, and Mr. Lennon wrote us back again that it
is his own personal wisdom to tell us and advise us that we
should not mingle with an organization that is Socialistic. Now,
this is the condition, that in the journeymen Tailors&rsquo;
Union that man is the absolute boss and power of that union. The
condition then will be that we will be kicked out of the
international union; and in this case, as the Manifesto says that
all members must hold membership in the local, national or
international union covering the industry in which they are
employed, in that case we could not comply with this point in our
Manifesto. Now, again, it stands to reason that it is better that
every union that is affiliated with the American Federation of
Labor&mdash;that it is better to stay and stand in the central
organization and fight for industrial unionism. Now, then, if
that is to be the case, we have got to have some protection one
way or another. But the only plausible way we can come to the
members and show up the advantages of industrial unionism is to
explain to them the difference between the old organization and
the new one. For instance, in our trade, the tailors, now we have
custom tailors, garment makers, cloak makers, cap makers, and I
think four or five like organizations in the garment trades. Now,
when the Journeyman Tailors&rsquo; Union is trying to amalgamate
with the garment workers, we would try to push the idea
furthermore in that particular union that all garment trades
should be included. If that is the idea of industrial unionism it
is practical and feasible. And then it should be understood that
the laundries and other trades will not mix in our affairs when
it comes to a local issue, or an issue in a similar organization;
because we must understand that if one of our organizations gets
into trouble, while we will always try to avoid it as far as we
can, but there is no doubt that in practical life we will be up
against it, either in one locality or in another one, that is as
far as the tailor trade is concerned. But now, you take for
instance, the condition of the printers here in this town or the
wood workers, and the difference between the men that are working
in this city and the mill hands in Michigan and other places. The
men out in the country can work cheaper and under better
conditions than the man that has a little cottage here in this
city. These are local issues, and this is only known particularly
to the craft that those men are employed in. If I understand the
Manifesto rightly, and there is no desire on my part to alter it,
we should build the whole thing up side down. But there is one
particular point that I want to call attention to, and that is
this, that centralization produces authority and despotism. That
is the point we are up against in human history all the way
through. On the other hand, we have got to try to centralize our
actions, as we know that only centralized action is efficient.
Now, we should have centralization and local authority without
despotism. It is a possibility. And on this point I think we may
consider the seven departments as they exist in the United States
government; the navy department, the war department, the postal
department, commerce, interior affairs, foreign affairs, etc.,
and that every one of those different unions that would be
affiliated with it, that it has its own autonomy as a trade, but
at the same time it be centralized in one principal department.
In this way we might have no more than seven instead of thirteen
as now. But I am satisfied that this committee, as the brother
states to us, have given us in this the best they could make; I
believe it is so, although I think it more expedient to have a
secretary to do the work necessary as far as writing and
correspondence is concerned, and have seven men representing
those seven industries on the Executive Board, and among the
seven they can pick out a President, or he could be appointed
here from the convention to perform the work. But practically the
work necessary for this organization would be only the work of a
secretary, with whatever he would need in the way of advice from
the Executive Board; because we have to keep in mind, as has been
stated several times over and over again, that we don&rsquo;t
want to keep up a pile of hangers-on in our organizations as
walking delegates and the man that would become ultimately a
figurehead. We must not give them an opportunity to prey on us,
and if we don&rsquo;t give them an opportunity they will stay
away, but if you do give them a chance they will take the chance,
and no one else but ourselves are to blame if we give them that
opportunity. Now, another thing. We have got the Western
Federation of Miners. Now, we know that the Western Federation of
Miners tried to organize their own craft or their own industry
the best they understood, and it would be folly for the tailors
or shoemakers or carpenters or any other trade to mix into their
convention and say, &ldquo;This is the way you should run those
affairs.&rdquo; So we say it is not the purpose. of this
organization to turn upside down the different trades. All those
that are working around the mines in whatever capacity, they have
got their say-so in their locality. That is the thing that is
understood by the system of industrial unionism. Furthermore, we
know that as a matter of expediency and for better administration
the Western Federation of Miners would have say over such a thing
as a District of Cripple Creek. Furthermore, we have got such a
thing as the State Federation of Utah, and of California. Now,
all the mines that are in those particular States find it to
their interest to have a State organization. They do it for their
own protection and to further their interests. Now, you see it
may be necessary, as Brother Fairgrieve of Montana pointed out,
that in some ways and in small localities it is very advisable if
you can group the people of that particular State where it is
necessary that all co-operate together. But the essential point
is this, that we never overlook the fact that we should all
belong to the same big family, the Industrial Workers of the
World. That is the point that the American Federation of Labor
never had and never can, that they are under a common
jurisdiction, but they have no ultimate purposes. The only
organization that we have got is for ultimate purposes, and that
is as far as we want to go, but all these minor questions we have
to settle among ourselves.</p>
<p>The next point is this, that many of the organizations have a
sick benefit and death benefit. Now, in many organizations we
will be up against it, because they would not withdraw and lose
the benefits. It is the sick and death benefits that keep them
back, or maybe insurance. These are all points in practical life
that with some individuals or some organizations we will be up
against. I think that in some ways the ideas of Brother Coates
are correct, for what he means is probably those. I do not know
whether I am correct or not, That designation is not broad enough
to take in all these; it is either too small or too broad. Take
for instance the printers. The printers say you will not know how
to manage their affairs, and he would not like to be mixed up
with the laundries, which is a trade recently mixed up with the
large packing houses, as Brother Sherman presented us the
evidence. Maybe Brother Coates did not know, as Brother Sherman
properly pointed out, that there are commercial houses,
industrial houses, that are running printing and laundry and
restaurant and all these businesses under one management. But
Brother Coates was probably figuring out just the conditions in
the trade that he knows about out in Montana. But this is the
only way we can get at it. We know that in the big majority of
the locals where we are that in every locality we are up against
something different. Now, I would like to suggest that we take
into consideration the organization of the French organizations,
as shown by the letter of Comrade Pouget. That organization is
organized on the principle as I outlined to you before. There is
a committee of seven with practical charge of all the big
business when they are in executive board session, and all the
business is done by the secretary. He is the man that is
responsible for the transactions during the time that the
executive board is not in session and during the time that the
convention is not in session. Now, you see, that lightens the
expense, and at the same time there is a central organization and
it is effective. There is no doubt but what in time we should
have a kind of organization which will come under this head when
progress has been made. But as a suggestion I would like to have
it understood by the committee that they should be given ample
latitude in the different trades to take up the suggestion, and
it will be the result of our intelligence and a way in which we
can do it better. We. must not be understood to direct in their
internal affairs. As an organization we must not be fanatics. If
we start out with fanaticism we might get into many difficulties
which we can avoid if we think it over coolly and carefully.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I am not going to take up over five minutes of
your time, probably not that long. I think this organization is
going to seriously disturb the present organizations. The Western
Federation will pass through an experience in the next ten years
that will shake them seriously. The printers will get a shake-up.
Organized labor as we know it to-day is going to get a severe
shaking, and that shaking is going to be done by the men who are
now at the bottom, living on chuck-steak and digging in the
sewers. The trades unionist of to-day has an advantage, and it is
the result of his organization. He has said to those who are not
organized, &ldquo;Organize and get the benefit of
organization,&rdquo; and the people have not heard his voice. The
condition of the printer to-day is the result of his
organization. But now this organization is going out and through
its educational department it is going to reach the man in the
sewer. It is going to reach the laborer who is earning $1.30 a
day,. and who pulls the truck for the man who is getting $3 a
day. his laborer in overalls who supports a wife and family on $7
a week, while the tradesman lives on the best with his $3 a
day&mdash;this laborer is :going to be lifted tip, and he is
going to say to the tradesman, &ldquo;It is as important that the
truck should be taken to the drill as it is that you should lay
out this hole where it is to be drilled. It requires muscle to
pull the truck, and it requires food to give muscle.&rdquo; And
the main work which this organization will have in the future is
not protecting those that are already organized, but lifting
those that are down in the gutter, so to speak, and those that
are at the starvation point, up to a level with those that are
now organized. That will be the work of this organization. The
organized labor of to-day is an aristocracy. It is a conceited,
selfish aristocracy, no better than the other aristocracies. The
man who is not the heir to a million, but is heir to a crafty
father who looks out into society&mdash;or the son of a wise
father, I will put it that way&mdash;who takes his boy and puts
him to a trade, and supports him while he is learning the trade,
and then after he has passed through his three years&rsquo;
experience he has learned something and he becomes superior to
the other fellow, the son of a $7-a-week man, the boy who has
been cheated out of as opportunity to learn a trade, and who has
probably been a bobbin boy in a mill for $10 a month. This whole
thing is running through the working class in America to-day, and
the purpose of this organization, as I understand it, is to
convince every man who works for a living, to write this deep and
indelibly in his memory, that every man and woman on this planet
has a right to the best that progress can give him or her, and it
does not matter whether the man digs in the sewer or whether he
records the course through which the planets pass. (Applause).
And mind you&mdash;</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: A point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What is your point of order?</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: That in the discussion he is engaged in he
should not be trying to cover the whole field, but that he should
discuss the proposition before the convention.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The point of order is well taken. The delegate
will confine himself to the question before the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I thought I was. I think the trade unions will be
in this movement in a very few years. The strength of this
movement will be given to the lifting up of those that are down.
It will not be given to the protection of those who are already
comparatively well off. So far as the international feature of it
is concerned, look at what we have right here in America. We have
got the Swede in his fraternal organization. We have got the
Irishman in his fraternal organization. We have got the Pole, we
have got the Frenchman. We have got all those different
nationalities in every city, with their charters hung up, and
what are they doing? They are trying, each of them, to convince
the other nationality that notwithstanding all that may be said
to the contrary, they are eminently respectable. We have had in
England the trades union movement for seventy years. We have had
the wise mechanic, the wise printer, the wise stone mason, and
all the rest of the skilled labor, and what have we got in
England? We have got the poor-house there; we have got poverty
there; we have got deformity there. And the same is true in
France, and the same it true in Ireland, and the same is true all
over the world.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegate will take notice that the
proposition is that this amendment of Delegate Coates be adopted,
and that that hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with the question on
which you are speaking at the present time, or the subject which
you are covering.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: Well, the argument has been on such a broad gauge
that I did not think that I went beyond the distance that most of
the other members did. However, I did not start out to take up
much of your time. I believe that the broader the gauge you can
put this movement on the better. I would ignore all the education
and all the experience that the trades union movement has got
to-day. I would ignore the whole thing. I would pay no attention
to it today. This organization is launched in recognition of the
class struggle by the working class. It is the working class, and
not for those trades organizations that are not willing to come
into this movement, thoroughly understanding that this movement
is not for the protection of any particular trade, and is not
going to concern itself very much as to preserving the advantages
that the particular trades have to-day as a result of their
organization, but it is going to concentrate all its efforts on
the lifting up of the men who are down. I think that is what we
want to keep in view, and I think if we do that we will go along
the right course.</p>
<p>DEL. Pat O&rsquo;Neil: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, down
in our country&mdash;I am led to tell a little story, but it will
take up but a minute or two&mdash;down in our country we have
what is called the Arkansas hog. We have got hogs that can outrun
anything. They have big bristles on their backs, and if they get
after you you want to climb. They will put their bristles up and
give a &ldquo;buh, buh, buh,&rdquo; and jump right over a hickory
sapling. They will jump over a fence and get into a potato patch,
and if a man goes after one of them the hog will run to his
fellows and they will get in a bunch and if they go for him he
had better get up a tree. So I find there is here a spirit of
that same kind. I don&rsquo;t care whether it is the
Typographical Union hog that has jumped into my potato patch or
not. Now, why the American workingman can&rsquo;t have as much
sense as the Arkansas razorback hog has, is what puzzles me. Now,
I want to ask you just a plain, practical question. You have got
a big strike on right here in this city. The teamsters&rsquo;
portion of your transportation department are out on strike.
About two months ago a large shipment of machinery was made from
this city down to Spadra, about thirty-five miles from where I
live. Now, mark you, I want to show you that these fellows
recognize that an injury to one is an injury to all, in spite of
the evidence of John Mitchell to the contrary. When that
machinery got there at Spadra our men refused to unload it. Then
they went over to Russellville and got a few men, mostly negroes
and a few white men, and when they came over there the men had a
talk to them, and they too refused to unload it. Now, mark you,
the proposition. The president of our district went down there;
Peter Handy, the president of the U. M. M. A., District No. 21,
went down to Spadra and ordered the union men of Spadra to unload
that machinery under threat of losing their charter. They still
refused to do it, and on the day when I left for Chicago
twenty-five of them were in the United States jail. Now, I want
to ask you a question, every one of you men who can&rsquo;t get
into your head what industrial unionism means, I want to ask you
this question: Suppose when your teamsters refused to handle
stuff here, and those non-union teamsters had put that stuff on
the train, if we had industrial unionism the railroad could not
move the stuff. That is what industrial unionism means, and I am
sorry to see any one come here and try to talk along the old,
craft union lines.</p>
<p>Delegate Simons took the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: It is now about five minutes to twelve, and I
don&rsquo;t wish to split any speaker&rsquo;s talk in two, so I
move that we adjourn till one o&rsquo;clock. (Seconded).</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I won&rsquo;t take over ten minutes. But it is
not important to me.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I think it is better to adjourn.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: Just as you say.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that we
adjourn till one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I rise to a point of order. It is not twelve
o&rsquo;clock. You will have to suspend the rules.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A motion to adjourn is always in order.</p>
<p>The motion to adjourn was lost.</p>
<h4>RATIFICATION MEETING.</h4>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: The committee on mass meeting and
ratification desires to announce to the convention&mdash;that is
four members of them do, there being five on the
committee&mdash;there are four members who desire to withdraw
their names from the committee, and if the convention sees fit to
appoint another committee it is entirely within their pleasure.
Mr. Bradley, Mr. Guy Miller, Mr. Cranston and Mr. McDonald desire
to have their names withdrawn from that committee on ratification
and mass meeting.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move you that these committeemen be allowed to
withdraw. (Seconded).</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>The convention then at twelve o&rsquo;clock adjourned until
one in the afternoon.</p>
