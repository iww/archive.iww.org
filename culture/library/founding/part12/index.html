<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>SEVENTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Tuesday, July 4</h3>
<h3>AFTERNOON SESSION</h3>
<p>Chairman Haywood called the convention to order at 2 P. M.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: When the convention adjourned it was to meet at
two o&rsquo;clock and take up the report of the Committee on
Constitution. Is the Committee on Constitution ready to
report?</p>
<p>The committee not being ready to report, a recess was taken,
and the convention reassembled at 2.50 P. M.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Have the different groups selected their members
for the Ritual Committee?</p>
<h4>RITUAL COMMITTEE</h4>
<p>The various groups handed in their selections, and the
Chairman announced the following as the Committee on Ritual:</p>
<p>American Labor Union&mdash;W. Shurtleff.</p>
<p>S. T. &amp; L. A.&mdash;S. J. French.</p>
<p>U. B. R. E.&mdash;J. S. McDonald.</p>
<p>Western Federation of Miners&mdash;(Selection deferred.)</p>
<p>Individuals&mdash;C. C. Ross, Guy E. Miller, James
Murtaugh.</p>
<h4>REPORT OF CONSTITUTION COMMITTEE</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will now have the report of the Committee on
Constitution. Proceed with the reading of the Constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: Mr. Chairman and brother and sister delegates, the
Constitution Committee appointed by the convention, who, I may
say for my associates on the committee, have worked faithfully
since their appointment, have made an effort to present a body or
constitution to this organization which we believe will be
sufficient to govern this industrial organization that may be
launched until a convention may be called some time in the
future. It is not necessary for me to enter into any
preliminaries in regard to the work of the committee, so I will
proceed to read, beginning at the Preamble. I might say that I
have understood that the Preamble drawn up by the committee on
constitution has already been adopted by this convention. I have
no personal knowledge of it, as I was not present on the floor of
the convention when this part of the work of the committee on
constitution was adopted. I will begin by reading the Preamble,
and then the constitution.</p>
<p>Delegate Moyer then read the Preamble and the first two
articles of the Constitution, after which, at his request,
Delegate T. J. Hagerty, Secretary of the Committee on
Constitution, completed the reading of the report.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the reading of the Constitution, Chairman
Moyer, on behalf of the Committee, added the following:</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: The Committee on Constitution, selected by this
convention a few days ago, submit their report at this time. We
fully realize that the matters set forth in the report submitted
may not be sufficient to govern this organization in the future.
We believe that we have submitted a form of constitution
sufficient to launch this industrial movement. We have agreed
upon this constitution, this report as read by the secretary of
the Committee on Constitution and myself, with the exception of
one member of the constitution committee. With the exception of
that one member we believe that this report, this form of
constitution, should be adopted by this delegation and this
industrial movement launched at this practical time, and that
such changes as may be necessary in the government of this
organization after being launched should be left in the hands of
an Executive Board or an Executive Council that may be selected
by this convention. In support of their report to this convention
the Committee on Constitution has the following motion:
&ldquo;Moved by De Leon and seconded by Hagerty that if any
amendments, changes or alterations are offered to this report by
the convention, Chairman Moyer of the Committee on Constitution,
shall demand in our name a roll call thereon.&rdquo; We submit
the report of the Committee on Constitution to you and it is now
your property. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the report be taken
up and read and acted on seriatim. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the report of the Committee on Constitution be taken up seriatim.
Are you ready for the question? (Question called for). All those
in favor of the motion will signify it by saying aye. Contrary
no. The motion is carried, and the secretary will please
read.</p>
<h4>DEBATE ON NAME</h4>
<p>Delegate T. J. Hagerty, secretary of the committee, then read
Section 1, Article 1, as follows: &ldquo;This organization shall
be known as &rsquo;The Industrial Workers of the
World.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to offer an amendment to the first
section. Instead of &ldquo;Industrial Workers of the
World,&rdquo; I want to offer the name &ldquo;The Industrial
Union of America.&rdquo; If I can get a second to the motion I
will give you my reasons for this. (Amendment seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the amendment. Are you ready for
the question?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, the only reason I offer this motion
is the fact that I realize that we, on the American continent,
have no right to organize a union for the workers of the world. I
realize that we can only organize the American part of the
industrial workers&rsquo; union of the world. I believe, Mr.
President and fellow delegates, that when we go into an
industrial workers&rsquo; organization of the world we must go
into an organization made up of like organizations as this from
every nation in the world into an international labor union of
the world; and I do not believe that we ought to begin with the
idea of stretching ourselves beyond the real domain of this
organization. I believe that England, Germany, France, and all
the various nations of the earth should be given their equal
right in organizing their great national and international
industrial organizations, and then we ought to come into an
international congress such as has already been organized and has
its headquarters now in Germany; and I believe we are, as I say,
beyond our territory when we attempt to launch this movement,
which must necessarily confine itself at least to America,
Canada, and the nearby nations that wish to come in with us in
this organization. I really believe that it would be more
attractive, if you please, to the workers of America, this latter
name that I suggest, I believe it will cover our entire
territory, and I believe that is the kind of name that we ought
to have, limiting ourselves to the American continent.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: I second the amendment, for this reason: We are
trying to launch an industrial union movement. Industrial
unionism is gaining more prominence among the workers, and by
calling this the Industrial Union of America we can explain the
idea of industrial unionism more intelligently. I therefore
second the amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. BERNINE: I have only one object in seconding this motion.
It was not because I wanted to confine it to a nationality,
because no one recognizes more than I do the international
character of the working class, being a member of that class.
There is throughout the world but one working class. (Applause).
Believing as I do that this union of the working class in America
is organized only for one purpose, one ultimate aim, one object,
and that the overthrow of the capitalist class, and knowing as I
do and as the members of the delegation with whom I am here, that
the workers of each country, although they unite with the workers
of the whole world, that the workers of each country must settle
with their own capitalist class ; and that is the only reason
that that point might be kept in view, that when the time is
opportune here for us to seize that for which we are organized,
and if we are not organized for that purpose we are simply
wasting our own time and deluding the workers with a false hope.
That purpose can only be, and it is the only purpose for which we
stand on the floor of this convention, the final and complete
emancipation of the working class and the absolute, unconditional
surrender by the capitalist class of all the means of production
to the people, namely, the working class. (Applause). Therefore I
believe that while we bear in mind that there is but one working
class and that we ought to be intimately joined with that class,
that the interests of the workers in Europe or in China are
identical with the interests of the workers in America, yet we
should not lose sight of the fact that we must finally settle
with our own capitalist class.</p>
<p>DEL. WRIGHT: I want to say, with regard to the name as settled
on by the Committee on Constitution, that we did not understand
the name to be a definition or an indication of the jurisdiction
of this organization. We understood the name of this organization
to be a general designation of our position with regard to all
the workers of the world. Now, I cannot conceive, nor do I, that
any name for any organization does define the jurisdiction of the
organization. And I cannot conceive, therefore, that the
questions that the other delegates have raised with regard to the
amendment and against the original proposition as presented by
the Committee on Constitution are valid. If they were valid it
would be different, but I do not believe that they are, under
those circumstances, since this name does not define the
jurisdiction of this organization. It simply sets forth to all
workingmen that we recognize the principle that we are all
workers of the world and belong as such in that category as
workers of the world, industrial workers of the world; and I
think that if we fly that banner as a name for the organization a
good deal, as some other organizations have flown the banner
&ldquo;Workingmen of All Countries Unite,&rdquo; we recognize the
fact nevertheless that the working class of each country would
have to settle with its own capitalist class in each respective
country. (Applause.)</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: I would like to ask the secretary or the committee
for the reasons for giving the name that the committee has?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J HAGERTY: As Brother Wright, of that committee, has
explained the meaning of the committee as far as I understand, I
do not think anything can be added to it except that in confining
the name to America it would shut out, for instance, one of our
brothers here in New Jersey who is in communication with the
members of his association in Hamburg, and would shut out a great
many in South America and Mexico who are not, so far as the word
&ldquo;American&rdquo; goes, practically, of the United
States.</p>
<p>DEL. BERNINE: Since the point I made seems to be fully
understood by this convention, I will withdraw my second, with
the consent of the maker of the motion.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>DEL. RIORDAN: I do not suppose there are very many delegates
here who care very much about international boundary lines, but I
am going to speak about how this name will be taken in the
country across an international boundary line, namely,
Canada.</p>
<p>There are many organizations over there which at the present
time are affiliated with organizations that are to become a part
of this organization. I am sure that they will protest or find a
little fault with the name &ldquo;America.&rdquo; We have over
there a great number of patriotic Canadians who do not agree with
the name of an organization defining itself too closely. At the
time that the American Labor Union changed its name from that of
the Western Labor Union it created a great deal of feeling
throughout British Columbia owing to the fact that they had made
the change without their approval. Now, I want to say, delegates,
that it creates more or less of a prejudice when you define
things so closely as to name or designate international boundary
lines. We have some over there, I will acknowledge, who realize
the fact that they must be cosmopolitan in a matter of this kind.
They do not want to recognize international boundary lines. I for
one do not. But there are many who are members of organizations
that are about to affiliate themselves with this organization who
will oppose a name of that kind, and I object to the name of
&ldquo;American&rdquo; in naming this organization.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: Brother Chairman and fellow delegates, when
you try to define what the boundary line is between one
nationality and another one, the only thing that is plausible is
this: it is the common submission of a common lot of men and
women to a common set of men that are ruling them in the name of
some supreme being or some supreme power, and this supposed-to-be
boundary is something that you neither can see nor feel, but it
is the plutocracy that organized it that way. We know we have got
Austrians, Chinamen, Japs, and people of all nationalities here
in this country. So we have got Frenchmen, Germans and Italians,
and we are a cosmopolitan crowd. Now, then, as it is, all lines
that were ever established have always been established by men
who were a bunch of robbers, thieves and exploiters, and we want
to combine ourselves as humanity, as one lot of people, those
that are producing the wealth of our oppressors, and we want to
have under that banner our brothers and sisters of the world.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment is that Section 1 of Article 1
shall be changed to read &ldquo;The Industrial Union of
America&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;The Industrial Workers of the
World.&rdquo; Those in favor</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: Roll call, Brother Secretary. (Roll call
seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will have a roll call if there is any
question as to the result of this vote.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Allow me to say a word in conclusion, and that
is, that if there is anybody here who believes that I am a
stickler for a national or international boundary he is very much
mistaken. But I think we ought to be at least sensible on the
matter. The idea is simply this with me: Of course we do not care
anything about the name of America or anything else. I agree
largely with my fellow delegate over here who spoke of the fact
that every nationality must settle its own questions, especially
industrial and political. There is no doubt about that. It is
true that perhaps it is not settled finally in any nation until
the rest of the world shall have acted. Nevertheless those are
national questions at the present time. But the chief idea that I
had in mind was this we have no right to take away the privilege
of any other nation to organize such a union as we here are
organizing. What complications will we get into if we accept the
membership in this organization of a man who lives in France or
in England or in any other nation? Are we going into all those
various nations to accept membership into this organization? If
we do we will have no end of turmoil in the ranks of organized
labor. We will perhaps get mixed up with men who do not want to
belong to their organizations there, who believe that they are
following the best policy in the interest of the workers and who
do not believe we have things right, and in fact we are going to
get into trouble if we attempt to stretch ourselves over the
world. We simply want to confine ourselves to the people who are
working closely together. There is no doubt in my mind but what
we will get along well with our fellow workmen in Canada or
Mexico or on the American continent. That was my idea of limiting
this extension or this boundary of the organization to the entire
American continent, where practically our interests are all
identical as far as the political features and the industrial
features are concerned. But I think we are going to get ourselves
mixed up with every other nation if we attempt to stretch this to
the industrial workers of the world and let individual
organizations, or individual members, if you please, of the
working class of every nation come into this organization. All I
want is some practical, sensible organization.</p>
<p>Question again called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The debate has been closed on this amendment.
The amendment is to change the name of this organization from
&ldquo;Industrial Workers of the World,&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Industrial Union of America.&rdquo; Those in favor of the
amendment will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no.</p>
<p>A division and a roll call were called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If a roll call is desired the secretary will
proceed.</p>
<p>The secretary proceeded to call the roll. Before the call of
the groups was finished Delegate Fitzgerald changed his vote from
no to yes. Delegate Sherman, in the absence of his colleague,
Kirkpatrick, stated that there was an understanding that the vote
of the United Metal Workers was to be cast as a unit. A delegate
suggested at this point that the further calling of the roll be
dispensed with, but the Chairman directed that it proceed. After
a few of the individual names had been called Delegate Murtaugh
suggested the uselessness of continuing the roll call in view of
the apparent result, but the call of the individuals was
completed. At the conclusion of the call&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment on the face of the count has been
lost. The secretary will count it up and give the correct result
of the vote. The amendment is lost.</p>
<p>(Later in the proceedings the result of the vote was announced
by the secretary as: Ayes, 3540; noes, 47,728.)</p>
<p>DEL. LUCY E. PARSONS: I recognize, at least I believe, that
the original name covers too much ground, and the one that has
been offered and lost covers too little, so I move that we
substitute &ldquo;The American Branch of the Industrial Workers
of the World.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Can we make an amendment to the motion?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There is no second to the amendment. The motion
occurs on the paragraph, Section 1 of Article 1 as already
submitted by the Constitution Committee. Those in favor of the
motion will signify it by saying aye, contrary no. The motion is
carried and the Section adopted. (Great applause). The secretary
will proceed to read.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty, of the Committee, then read Section 2 of
Article 1, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 2. (a) And shall be composed of thirteen international
industrial unions, designated as follows Division 1 shall be
composed of all persons working in the following industries:
Clerks, salesmen, tobacco, packing houses, flour mills, sugar
refineries, dairies, bakeries and kindred industries.</p>
<p>Division 2. Brewery, wine and distillery workers.</p>
<p>Division 3. Floriculture, stock and general farming.</p>
<p>Division 4. Mining, milling, smelting and refining coal, ores,
metals, salt and iron.</p>
<p>Division 5. Steam railway, electric railway, marine, shipping
and teaming.</p>
<p>Division 6. All building employes.</p>
<p>Division 7. All textile industrial employes.</p>
<p>Division 8. All leather industrial workers.</p>
<p>Division 9. All wood working employes excepting those engaged
in building departments.</p>
<p>Division 10. All metal industrial employes.</p>
<p>Division 11. All glass and pottery employes.</p>
<p>Division 12. All paper mills, chemical, rubber, broom, brush
and jewelry industries.</p>
<p>Division 13. Parks, highways, municipal, postal service,
telegraph, telephone, schools and educational institutions,
amusements, sanitary, printing, hotel, restaurant and laundry
employes.</p>
<p>Central bodies. Central bodies (first) composed of seven or
more local unions in two or more industries shall be known as
industrial councils; (second) Local unions, in such industries as
are not organized and represented on the General Executive Board;
(third) Individual members in such places where there is not a
sufficient number of workers to organize a local union in any
industry.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of Section 2 of
Article 1. What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Mr. Chairman, I move that we concur in the
recommendation of the Committee on Constitution on that Section.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that we
concur in the recommendation of the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, I want to offer an amendment. The
amendment is that the second paragraph of Article 1 shall read
&ldquo;This organization shall be composed of national and
international unions embracing all workers of an industry,&rdquo;
instead of thirteen division as made up.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Have you got the amendment written? If so,
please hand it up.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes, sir. (Handing written amendment to the
Chairman.)</p>
<p>The amendment was seconded by a number of delegates.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: An amendment has been offered to Section 2 of
Article 1. There are lots of seconds. The amendment is that
Section 2, Article 1 be amended to read &ldquo;Shall be composed
of national and international unions embracing all workers of an
industry.&rdquo; You have heard the amendment. Are you ready for
the question?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, I offer that amendment for the
reason that I think we are making a very serious mistake indeed
in trying to divide the workers of the world into thirteen
industries, or rather thirteen industrial divisions. While I
agree that an injury to one worker is the injury of all,
nevertheless my experience in trades unions has shown me that a
peculiar thing that directly affects one industrial branch does
not directly affect the workers in another industry; the
particular feature of their complaint, the particular demand that
they make for their working conditions. And I believe that an
international organization ought to be made up of solely
those&mdash;or one of the departments rather of this organization
ought to be made up solely of those people in a single industry.
Now, tell me, if you please, what connection the hotels, the
public parks, the theatres, the musicians, the restaurant
employes, and the laundry employes have with the printing or the
publishing industry, if you please? And I want to call your
attention to the fact that the fundamental principle underlying
this organization says that when one part of this industry
strikes, the entire industry strikes; and just as soon as we
begin to take out the printers for a remedy of the conditions in
the line of publication in whatever field it may be in that
branch of industry, we are practically forced, by bringing these
other people into their section, or rather, into their
international union, to take out the restaurant employes, the
laundry employes, the musicians and the various other ten or
twelve or fifteen separate industries grouped under this
thirteenth head. I think we are going purely crazy as far as the
practical feature of lining these people into an organization is
concerned. I won&rsquo;t attempt at this time, nor do I desire to
attempt to put into the constitution the limits of any industry.
That has been a mooted question in the organized labor world for
a number of years. Why, we have a division of all kinds of crafts
in an identical trade, men who work practically on the same
material, in the same shop, and yet they are contending for a
division. I want to throw everybody in that industry into one
organization and make it an industrial organization; not merely
to fix a set principle for this organization at this time,
grouping ten, twelve or fifty different and separate industrial
organizations under one head and one international organization.
I think if we are to accomplish anything at all in the way of
working up this organization to a practical organization, to an
organization of usefulness to the workers of this country, or of
the world, if you please, we must begin on a practical basis,
simply attempting at this time to wheel into line the men and
women who work shoulder to shoulder every day in the year as wage
workers.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: As I understand, the economic organization
of the working class is devised to meet the organization of the
capitalist class. It must correspond, organ for organ, tissue for
tissue, to the structure of capitalist industries, rather than to
the craft divisions that exist at present among the workers.
Those who have read Charles Edward Russell&rsquo;s articles in
Everybody&rsquo;s Magazine on &ldquo;The Greatest Trust in the
World,&rdquo; know that the beef trust to-day is no longer a beef
trust, it is a food trust, an international commissary
department. That fact is recognized by our fellow-workers in
Switzerland, who have practically the same arrangement that we
have here in their culinary industrial union of Switzerland, in
which they take in tobacco workers, bakery workers, brewery, wine
and distillery workers, and all cooking trades, as one industry.
To-day we have in this country no longer a few corporations
owning a few railroads; to-day we have a department of
transportation, with its own international steamship lines,
owning and buying up electrical interurban lines&mdash;a distinct
department of transportation. It is declared to be the ultimate
aim of this organization to train the workers to take
over&mdash;to take and hold that which they produce by their
labor; to administer the things that they take; to administer
them according to the best developed system. The system of
industry to-day is no longer a system of old international crafts
or trades. Even the system of government is not such to-day. We
have men representing in the government, not electoral
constituencies, but industries. We have Senator Aldrich, general
manager of the United States, representing the transportation
department of the capitalist system of society. (Applause). Now,
we propose to organize the workers to meet the structure of the
capitalist class. The employe in Odessa, as we read in the papers
of this week, is being exploited by exactly the same employer as
the employe of the McCormick Harvester Company and the
International Harvester Company here in Chicago, because we read
that the International Harvester Company&rsquo;s plant is
involved in the troubles in Odessa. The workers are beginning to
have one master the world over. There is one capitalist class the
world over. We may talk about meeting a particular capitalist
class in this country, but it is not true. We are meeting the one
world capitalist class, and we must not be afraid to meet that
class on their own ground and according to their own forms. We
must no longer fight with the little popguns of craft unions in a
small international union against the modern shrapnel of the
capitalist system, but we must be prepared to meet their
conditions and go them one better. We must be prepared to meet
their class according to the economic groupings demanded in the
Manifesto that called this convention, and not through the narrow
emphasizing of the old craft spirit that divided and split up the
workers and allowed them to be scattered by the capitalist class
in a divided and disorganized craft unionism. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. C. O. SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman and fellow delegates,
Delegate Coates seems to be wonderfully fearful that the workers
of the United States will become acquainted with those who under
circumstances that they were not responsible for, happen to be
governed under some other nation. The first point he made in his
argument was that he believed we were going too far when we
called ourselves the workers of the world.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I rise to a point of order. We have got through
with the discussion of that matter, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter
what this gentleman has said about a separate question.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: The second argument he makes he also brings in
that same point when he offers an amendment that we shall have
national and international organizations. Who is to be the judge
of that class of workers in the United States that should not be
international with the world? What class shall be given the
especial privilege in the United States that they shall be
classed under &ldquo;international organization?&rdquo; I am not
unmindful of the fact that the chart as set forth here is quite
contrary to the old-fashioned and rotten system under which the
trades unionists have gone along so many years. I am not
unmindful of the fact that we are going to meet opposition that
will support the brother who has offered the amendment. But those
who were instrumental in drawing up this Manifesto which has
resulted in this magnificent representation of the producers of
the United States, took into consideration this: that this
organization must take the initial step forward, if we were going
to break down the old system of craft organization. (Applause).
And it is on the Manifesto that this committee has drawn up this
constitution. We have stood by the lines of that Manifesto. If I
understand the proposition right, Mr. Chairman and delegates,
that is what we are here for&mdash;to form an organization as
outlined by that Manifesto. (Applause). And the first delegate
that raises up any objection to any part of that Manifesto, I
will all the time object to his position. We are called here with
the expectation, according to that Manifesto, to form an
organization that would represent the producing class of the
world. (Applause). I want to say to my brother delegate who has
offered this resolution that he need not be afraid we will offend
anybody. If there is one Frenchman in France, one Englishman in
England, one German in Germany, or one man in any other country
that desires to take out a membership in our organization, if I
had anything to do with it I should always stand up and say that
we must protect that individual to the full ability of our
organization. (Applause). It is that way, and that way only,
brothers and sisters, that we are going to break down this rotten
system called trade autonomy, which has been so detrimental ever
since it has been introduced. He says, &ldquo;What difference
does it make if the printers strike?&rdquo; To me it makes a
difference if anybody strikes; it is my grievance (applause), and
I want to be in an organization that can be of use to protect
that worker, no matter whether he be a printer or a candy maker.
(Applause.) Your Committee on Constitution felt at this time that
thirteen groups was as small as we could reduce them at this
time. But for myself, I do expect, if I live to be ten years
older, that it will be reduced to three groups instead of
thirteen. I believe that this is going to bring forth an
education that will bring to the workers a realization that the
injury of one is the injury of all (applause), and that there is
no distinction between the workers. The producing class, whether
they work in metal, wood, paper or any other way, as long as they
sell their labor in the open market in a competitive system,
their interests are identical, and there is no common ground
between the producer and the exploiter. (Applause), I hold that
if this organization now in its birth should go out after issuing
this Manifesto, and recognize a national organization, that that
would destroy the whole force of the Manifesto calling for this
gathering. I for one as a member of that Constitution Committee
will stand first, last and all the time for everything that has
been read before this audience this afternoon in that
constitution. I thank you. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. H. S. DAVIS: I wish to address the convention. To the
local in which I hold a membership in the American Labor Union,
that chart as now organized means the destruction of that local.
I wish to know in what particular position that local will be
placed. I refer to the Butte Working Men&rsquo;s Local Union No.
5, of the American Labor Union, composed principally of ditch
diggers, etc., with a jurisdiction extending over all unorganized
crafts and callings there, till another organization of that kind
with jurisdiction begins; all over Silver Bow county and clear
into the other counties until the jurisdiction lines of some
other organization of that kind begins; principally in Silver Bow
county.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you ask for information?</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Yes, where do we get off as a local?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is the opinion of the chair that you would be
in Division 13, Highways and municipal work.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: All right; that is a question that will be put to
me as soon as I arrive home.</p>
<p>DEL. DUNCAN MCEACHREN: I desire to find out wherein this
grouping that is in the chart as outlined by Comrade Hagerty
conflicts with industrial organization. I cannot see, as far as I
am able to see, wherein Delegate Coates finds any conflict. He
seemed to argue along the same lines and come to the same
conclusion, with the exception of some difference as to national
and international unions. I cannot see where they conflict. Their
arguments are alike. They sound similar to me, and I believe they
are alike.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: We will hear the explanation of the
secretary.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY, of the committee: The section here calls
for thirteen divisions, thirteen departments or groups in which
the workers shall be internationally organized. As I understand
Delegate Coates&rsquo;s amendment, it does away entirely with
these thirteen groups and means any number of national and
international industries. It might mean 60; it might mean 500 for
all I know; it might mean 1,000. We might call the business of
making toothpicks a separate complete industry, so that there
would be a department of toothpick makers, including all the
fellows in the business of toothpick making, and so on
interminably. This means a logical arrangement, so far as we can
see to-day; a logical grouping of the workers in thirteen
economic groups or departments, bringing together more closely
the workers on the basis of the class struggle, and the
eliminating and blotting out as far as possible of all craft
lines, craft jealousies and trade aristocracies.</p>
<p>DEL. GILBERT: Comrades, Delegate Coates asked a question that
has not been answered. That is my only reason for rising in order
to say something to this effect: He mentioned a number of trades
or callings to be grouped under the one head, and of course they
appeared very divergent and disconnected, and he said,
&ldquo;What has the printing trade got to do with those?&rdquo;
For fear that he or some member might think that we are carried
away by sentiment, I am going to answer his question. If he will
revert to the wording of the original document he will see that
it says that they &ldquo;will strike in a given industry when
necessary.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t forget that &ldquo;when
necessary.&rdquo; Each particular calling will make its own
especial rules, as far as those kinds of dealings with the
capitalists are concerned, they apply only to them. But it is
said, &ldquo;I cannot see any rightful connection between laundry
workers and printers.&rdquo; Supposing the laundry workers are
having some kind of trouble, why should the printers print lies
about the strike, under the pretext that it was not their fight?
If the printers are called upon to print lies concerning them,
then it takes up the cause of the laundry workers right then and
there, and this is one of the times when it is made necessary for
the whole group to battle together in common.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: I make no contention at this time that
the imaginary lines drawn between the industries by this
committee are absolutely correct, but they are, in the judgment
of the committee that this convention saw fit to turn the matter
over to, as just and equitable as they could arrange at this
time. If you will notice in the constitution further on, there
are certain powers given to the Executive Board to classify
organizations. If it should be found that some unions are classed
with or identified or attached to a division, and it would be to
their interest to be attached to another division, reason would
naturally cause us to believe that the change would be so made,
but in order to make a start the first step must be made. This,
as I understand, is to be an organization organized on the
industrial plan, wherein all the industries revolve around one
center&mdash;that is, the management of the
organization&mdash;where the workers in any one industrial center
look to it for advice, assistance and support in making their
contentions in its industrial battle for existence. Now, it may
be possible to change some of those lines so as to be fairer than
what is represented by that chart at the present time. It might
be better, to the minds of some, to make fewer divisions or a
greater number of divisions. But, as I stated a moment ago, to
the minds of the committee to whom this convention delegated the
power of preparing a constitution for your consideration, that is
the result of their efforts. If it is wrong, if it is unfair, I
believe that I can safely say that it is the fault of the heads
of those individuals and not of the hearts. It is in accordance
with the best judgment and the ability of which they are
possessed. If it is not for the best interests of the
organization it is your fault in not placing people on the
committee who had more ability. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I am one of that committee who would not vote
for the report of the committee. Brother Moyer mentioned one man
who dissented; I am the dissenter, for several reasons. In the
State that I come from, Montana, the question of uniting the
workers into one organization has been something that has been
agitated by the people there in their local unions, in their
State and central organizations, for years. I believe there went
from Montana into the first convention in Denver calling for a
resolution of this kind, from Brother Sullivan of Butte. They had
tried to devise an organization that would be most effective.
After they got this Manifesto they looked over and read the
Manifesto thoroughly, but they thought that when we came here the
men who had issued this Manifesto would have a constitution drawn
up that they thought the workers should work under. Now, then, I
was put on the special committee to draft a part of the
constitution. We brought in a report on the lines of this
resolution that I submitted to the first committee, on State
lines, to organize the workers in State organizations, but to
unite them by a national congress of labor that would have a
control over the entire organization of any and all kinds, for
the purpose of eliminating any jurisdictional fight that might
come up between different crafts and different industries,
grouped all together. The intellectuals of that committee opposed
it on the ground that it would place too much power in the hands
of the State, within State lines, that they might use it for
political prestige. Now, it seems that they were afraid of their
horses, since if you leave the power in the hands of the
collective membership in the State or in the organization, and
have the imperative mandate controlling your representatives, the
leaders will never dare to use their power for the advancement of
any political party, whatsoever. We were told by the committee
that the chart did not mean anything, that the Manifesto was the
work of one single individual. Now, we did not confine ourselves
to that chart, but we brought in a report for an organization
along certain lines. The committee threw it in the waste basket
because the convention has committed itself to a certain policy
and you cannot inject this part or any part into it. I want to
say this, that I cast my vote on the first part, the name of this
organization&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I rise to a point of order. I take the position
that the brother is not confining himself to the matter before
the convention, and I ask the chair to rule on it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The point of order is well taken, Brother
Fairgrieve.</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I realize this, that this is about the only
place that I can be heard on this question, and I take the
opportunity for the view of the unions of Montana to get before
the convention on this question.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I have seconded the amendment of Brother
Coates. It seems to me that every great national movement has
certain central underlying principles that make that movement
necessary. The material facts, the underlying principles that
called the industrial union conference together in January, were
in my judgment the almost universal demand on the part of
organized labor in America and a great part of the unorganized
working people of this country for industrial unionism. It seems
to me that the economic development of the United States and of
the world at this time emphasizes the necessity for industrial
unionism. It seems to me that the working class want industrial
unionism. On the other hand, it does not seem to me that the
material facts, the underlying principles of economic development
indicate a desire on the part of the working people of this
country or any other to divide the working people into certain
arbitrary groups named divisions or by any other name that may be
given them. And I dispute the fact, Mr. President, that the
Manifesto adopted by the conference in January provided for the
arbitrary grouping of the working people into thirteen fixed
divisions outlined on the chart now facing this convention. I
maintain that the conference in January declared
straightforwardly and in unmistakable terms for industrial
unionism as provided for in the amendment now pending before this
convention. I maintain that the conference in January protested
strongly against craft unionism; not for the reason that it
intended to declare for certain arbitrary fixed groups, but for
the reason that it intended to declare and did declare for
industrial unionism. The amendment offered by Delegate Coates, in
my judgment, does not provide for craft unionism in any sense of
the word, and it seems to me ridiculous for a delegate to get on
the floor of this convention and say that he cannot understand
how many groups there would be in an industrial union
organization with the limited industrial organization of this
country. It seems to me ridiculous for him to mention the
possibility of there being 100 or 500 such groups. Regardless of
how the delegate may feel on this question, I feel certain that
the great mass of the American working people recognize what
industrialism means, and they recognize that it means the
combining together in one international industrial organization
of the world the crafts or trades embraced in one particular
industry. And industrial unionism is further emphasized by the
industrial union conference in January; it means the banding
together of all such international industrial organizations in
one general union of the working class. It seems to me that if we
can confine this organization to the thirteen arbitrary groups or
divisions as set forth by the Constitution Committee, that we are
going to put before the working people of this country a
proposition that they do not want and do not know anything about,
and it will be absolutely unworkable when it goes before them. I
do not think, Mr. Chairman, that a clear declaration for
industrial unionism would result in any appreciably greater
number of departments than thirteen as stated in the chart now
before this convention. I do not see how from a study of that
chart there could possibly be, if all of the working people of
this country were organized, more than sixteen or eighteen
international industrial organizations. But it seems to me, Mr.
Chairman, that if this organization is going to succeed it must
follow the natural lines of economic development, and not follow
the arbitrary fixed lines that may be set forth by this
convention or this Constitution Committee, saying that certain
men should be placed in a certain place, and these women there,
and that they shall not be welcome in any other places in this
organization. I believe that the natural course of economic
development is for organization by industries. I believe that the
working people want organization by industries, and I believe
that it will not involve this organization in any greater number
of international organizations than the Constitution Committee
provides for, and I believe that the plan submitted by the
Constitution Committee is unworkable.</p>
<p>DEL. W. L. HALL: As there has already been some difference
between those who have been instrumental in calling this
convention, and the precedent for manifesting this difference has
already been established, it occurs to me that I have a right to
intrude some of the ideas that I had as a signer of the call for
this convention. It occurs to me that there is one general
principle underlying what might be termed an economic
organization of the working people, and that one principle is
centralized administration. It occurs to me that that one factor
in labor organizations, administration, has a greater influence
upon the individual character towards bringing about solidarity
of the working people than any other factor with which we have to
contend. We have already departed from the true spirit of those
who called this convention by establishing thirteen different
administrations in this one union that was called for. The
Manifesto clearly states that &ldquo;an organization fulfilling
these conditions must consist of one central union embracing all
workers&rdquo;; and it establishes itself upon that principle a
little further on by saying, &ldquo;All members must hold
membership in the local, national or international unions
covering the industry in which they are employed.&rdquo; Now,
that does not mean that this national or international union is
set aside as a separate administration; it simply means that for
clerical purposes, for purposes of grouping the members and
recognizing their groups economically, they are placed in that
position to each other. But the idea was to centralize
administration. The idea, as I say, has been departed from by the
committee, but I presume the committee considers that we are not
in a perfect state of development; therefore that it was
necessary for them to depart in certain measures from the ideal
of an economic organization. Now, then, if we follow Delegate
Coates&rsquo;s suggestion and establish 50 or 60 different or
further administrations in this one economic organization, it
occurs to me that we will rob it of the force that it will have;
it seems to me that we are weakening the movement by establishing
these different administrations. What is meant by an
administration? What is meant by Brother Coates&rsquo;s motion to
have them grouped as international unions? It means simply the
setting up of another administration within this one great
administration. Now, then, I claim that the fewer of those that
we have, the better it will be, the more strong will your
movement be, the more we will be in accord with that which is
demanded by the working people; that is, a form of an
organization that will serve their economic needs. Now, I do not
care to occupy much of your time, but I would like to call
attention to that one general principle underlying a perfect
economic organization of the working people, and whenever you
divide that administration&mdash;it may be for reasons that you
cannot avoid, or it may be for various reasons but for whatever
reasons, whenever you divide that administration, we are thus far
departing from the true principles underlying an economic
organization. I claim that to have a perfect economic
organization we must have a centralized administration and an
absolutely centralized financial system before we can accomplish
it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you give any independence, which you do through
separate administration by a division of the organization, you
have separated that to that extent from the general movement.
Now, I do not pretend to say that we can form a perfect economic
organization of the working people, but what I do say is that we
can get as close to it as possible, and I believe the grouping
suggested by the committee, if that is as close as they can get,
is reasonably far enough away from the idea. I do not like even
this grouping, but I think it is better than leaving it to a
board of directors to decide what is an international. I venture
to say that there is no one well enough posted upon the condition
and the economic development of this country to ascertain what is
a real industrial union. If they cannot decide, it suggests the
idea of jurisdictional strife between different divisions. Now,
we are going to have that with this division. Here are thirteen
grand divisions that we are going to have according to this plan.
We are going to have men who are sitting at the head of these
different divisions struggling for their organizations. We are
going to have them contending that there is some other division
of the organization making unfair rates or taking in men that do
not belong to them. Now, the more you extend that, the more
internationals you organize, the more of this jurisdictional
strife you are going to have in the organizations, and it will be
the running sore that will destroy us eventually. I claim that we
should have our eyes upon the future economic organization of the
working people, and if we cannot adopt it now, let us at least
announce that that is the correct principle and have something in
the future to work to, and be assured, the fewer the number of
groups in this organization we shall have, the shorter road to
travel. We must avoid all that we possibly can anything that will
suggest a jurisdictional struggle between these divisions,
because that is what is really destroying the American Federation
of Labor; that is the one thing that has made it really
ineffective. If there had been perfect peace and harmony between
the different organizations of the American Federation of Labor,
they would have been just as much an economic organization of the
working people as this one that we are forming, and we should not
follow the American Federation in failing to recognize those
facts. They have been dividing men by reason of the tools that
they work with, but we must divide them by industries as much as
possible. I claim that we need to absolutely centralize the
administration of this organization, absolutely centralize it
into one general administration. You can divide it for clerical
purposes if you will, or for statistical purposes, as the
legislation of the future is going to be largely a matter of
statistics. We will probably need to divide the working people
for statistical purposes only. But to divide them for
administrative purposes is, I say, establishing a sore in the
organization that will destroy us. I venture to say now that if
we establish the principle that these thirteen different
divisions of labor are an absolute fact that we must deal with,
in the period of ten years from now we will have to do exactly
what we are doing now, destroy this organization in order that we
may establish one that more closely states the needs and
requirements of the working people. I believe this will be
destroyed eventually unless we establish firmly the principle
that centered administration and a centered financial system must
be the thing that we are to work to in the future. Let us, if we
cannot do better, not do worse by establishing a greater number
of divisions of this organization. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. GOODWIN: As I understand that chart there with its
subdivisions of industries, I look upon it as mirroring the
industrial field. Further, I look at this organization that we
are trying to launch here or are going to launch as the economic
organization of the working class, as a class union which, by
virtue of the fact of capitalist development and in the peculiar
way in which it is developed, we must make our organization
conform to that development. We see capitalist production divided
into several departments, but the principle of division is no
more important than for economic organization. As Brother Hall
has just remarked, the necessity of economic organization is
shown by the experience of the past few years in reference to the
differences between international organizations dealing with
different kinds of commodities, which Brother Hagerty mentioned
in his remark about the toothpick business. But if we have an
organization where we have got to be continually changing our
organization in the same proportion as the changes in capitalist
production, wiping out an old industry and starting a new, we
will be constantly tearing down and building up again. If
industry could be divided up into certain specific groups
according to certain commodities that never changed, then we
might group men in a certain division. Flying machines might come
and we could put them in their place. If we divide up our
organization into various parts with reference to the commodities
that are changing, we have got to launch a new industrial union
every time a new commodity is introduced. I think it is far
preferable to have fewer divisions. The anatomist looks at the
human body in the light of so many organs. You might divide the
anatomy in another way, but you never change those functions or
those parts. You might change the classification, but still at
the same time the old functions are there. I look upon this
movement, and I think those most progressive in this movement
look at it in the same way, that we should only mirror the
industrial field. We see capitalist production, and that it very
much resembles the human anatomy, divided up into separate
functions something like the brain, heart, etc. You cannot tell
nor you cannot lay down a line of demarcation between two
industries and do it exactly, any more than you can lay down the
line of demarcation between the functions of the heart and
stomach, because those two functions intermingle. You cannot
separate them and take one out without taking the other. Hence
these divisions, however important they are, should be
commensurate, should be in line with the real divisions of
capitalist production in the way industries are carried on and
largely divided. It should be a reflection of the industrial
field and practically set it forth.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: I do not desire to take up time, but I want to go
on record as indorsing the statement made by Delegate Hall, and
in doing so I wish to say that I think the delegate voiced the
sentiments of the S. T. &amp; L. A. as well.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;BRIEN: Last fall there was an international
conference held in St. Louis, and if you would go over the
general scope of that conference you would see that its scope was
almost identical with this. There was a chart with groupings and
sub-groupings. It appears to me from the remark of a brother on
the floor that there is a question involved in the main groupings
and what are termed the sub-groupings, and that it might be
necessary in an economic organization to have sub-groupings. I
believe you can have the departments and the sub-groups without
destroying the general function and general solidarity of the
organization. I believe it will be necessary for other
departments of this organization to have a working principle. I
believe in the development of that system of organization. In
order to inaugurate a working class republic it will be necessary
to have some groupings without destroying the one purpose for
which this convention is called together.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: I desire some information, so that when I go
back to my organization I can answer the questions that may be
asked of me. I think this will be practical and that we will be
able to work along that line, but there are certain questions
that I imagine will be asked of me by all the brothers in the
branch in which I may be grouped: &ldquo;Who is going to
determine the rates of wages and hours of labor in each
particular occupation or trade?&rdquo; Questions of that kind
will probably be asked. We want to get down to the practical
working of the organization. When we go to a member and present
this proposition to him and ask him to vote to bring his
organization in, he will want to know what this is to be before
he will consent that his organization shall go into this. Now,
who can tell who is to determine these matters? Will it be those
in charge of the particular industries or groups that will
determine for themselves? And supposing some one organization,
say in the building trades, wants to fix wages and hours one way,
and another organization says &ldquo;That is unfair,&rdquo; and
they are asking if a strike shall be ordered to carry out their
ideas, would all the others in that particular group be compelled
to go on strike because this one trade asked that which may be
unfair? Supposing all the others would not consent to it. I want
to get at the practical working method, and if some one will give
me the idea I will be prepared to answer them, but at the present
time I could not. Perhaps Brother Hagerty can answer me that, or
some one else.</p>
<p>DEL. KNIGHT: I do not care to argue this one way or the other,
but as I understand, this convention cannot settle the technical
subjects that will arise. In order to organize we have formed
these groups. We realize that it is an evolutionary process and
will develop in the future. This is the foundation process, and
from that the Executive Board, the President, the
Secretary-Treasurer and the organizers can go before the working
class and put this proposition up to them. We will depend upon
the knowledge of the working class in the various branches of
labor, and the organizers and the Executive Board can then
develop this question. It will require human brains and human
activity to make any of these things go. We should not imagine
that when we set this thing down that that settles the question.
There is going to be an application of mind and intelligence to
this proposition, and that is exactly the way the committee
proceeded in drawing up this proposition. I agree with what has
been said in favor of a strongly centralized organization, and we
want to centralize this as much as possible at the present time
so as to get out to the worker and begin the work of organizing
the workers and get the material and proceed to divide it up
technically and place them, in the position in which they belong.
I say that because I thought it might clear up somewhat the
proposition.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Any further remarks? When Delegate Coates
addresses the convention again on this question that will close
the debate on this question.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: It seems that one member of the Constitution
Committee could not concur in the report of the committee,
wishing to set up a department of State autonomy or something to
that effect. I believe that a study of this plan in the light of
the industrial development of the world will reveal to you the
fact that capitalism is organizing the business of the world, and
the great factories of the future are to be marked not by State
lines, not by geographical lines laid out by a surveyor, but by
great industrial departments such as we have before us in the
world to-day, such as the Standard Oil Company, the great
trans-continental lines of railway that run between the Gulf of
Mexico, and the great world-wide telegraphic organization of the
means of communication, which, with industrial development, are
wiping out State lines. Over a hundred years ago there was
brought into existence a new nation that was organized by a lot
of middle class capitalists and a lot of businessmen. Thirteen
States were inaugurated at first, but that group of thirteen
States down in the East have changed to a very great extent, and
one or two of the States to-day have a great deal more power than
the half dozen New England States. If we start out with this
division, which is merely suggestive as an organization, it does
not necessarily follow that it will always remain as it is
outlined here to-day. I think I have been informed by the
Constitution Committee that there is provision in the
constitution made whereby workers in a department or working in
an industry will be able, by a vote or by the Executive Board, to
take themselves out of one department and put themselves over in
another department if they find that their interests are
identical with those of the workers in that department. So I do
not think we need to be alarmed about dividing the workers into
thirteen different groups. The question has been asked,
&ldquo;Who will regulate the wages and the hours of work?&rdquo;
etc. Who do you think ought to have the right to regulate the
hours of work and the wages of the railroad employes, or the
telegraphers, or the mail clerks? It is laid down in the
Manifesto that there is to be craft autonomy locally, industrial
autonomy internationally. I think that the employes of the great
trans-continental transportation division ought to be
internationally united, with power to regulate their own affairs,
hours of labor, rates of wages, etc. My friends, I do not think
we need to be carried away with the idea that we are dividing the
workers by groups yet as suggested by the Committee on
Constitution, or that they have made an attempt. If you will look
over this long list of thirteen groups, it classifies the workers
according to the industry in which they are at work and with the
workers whom they probably are in harmony with altogether.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I want to ask one question, so that I will be
cleared up. No matter what sort of an organization we form, no
matter what plan we get, can we avoid the aristocratic feature in
the organization, can we get rid of the aristocratic idea that
separates locomotive engineers from laborers?</p>
<p>DEL. CRONIN: The Constitution Committee, in making this
report, reported to this convention that they intended to submit
to the convention for their consideration a skeleton of the
constitution. Therefore I say that they have no right to draw up
a large chart setting forth the different departments for the
various organizations that desire to affiliate whenever it shall
be established. For this reason there is a lot of international
unions formed upon the industrial line in America to-day that I
believe are all ready to join this organization, providing they
can come in here as an industrial union and not be combined with
any other distinct craft or calling or any other industry.
Consequently I say that we should form our industrial union on
industrial lines, not upon a chart where you put together
different industries in certain departments.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I have listened very attentively to the various
remarks on this subject, and it seems to me that the entire thing
is a tempest in a teapot. I can see absolutely nothing in the
grouping as put forth in that chart other than an apology for
craft unionism as it exists to-day. We each and every one of us
who believe in industrial organization, perhaps have in our own
minds a plan drawn upon which we believe the industrial
organization should be built. I want to say that in so far as my
conception of industrial organization is concerned, it means
entirely the solidarity of which we spoke so much in the
beginning of this convention and of which we are beginning to
lose sight now when confronted with the practical problem. That
was all I desired to say, Mr. President.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Any further remarks on the question?</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Coates has the floor for the closing
remarks.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: I am not
dismayed by anything that has been said in opposition. I am
rather surprised, however, to hear some remarks that have been
made, particularly the remark of Delegate Sherman when he
intended to carry out the impression that I stood for the
old-line craft organization. Now, he knows better than that. I
want to say to the delegates of this convention that another
impression that Delegate Sherman gave out, I think is an error;
not deliberately used, I don&rsquo;t believe, to sway this
convention, but at the same time having that tendency; and that
was that this &ldquo;wheel of fortune&rdquo; up here&mdash;I
cannot call it anything else&mdash;was a part and parcel of the
Manifesto. I want to deny that it is a part of the Manifesto. It
has been said so by one of the originators of this call. It was
not, and I have not heard anybody on this floor say that it was
except as intimated by Delegate Sherman&mdash;if he intended to
stick to the Manifesto&mdash;maintaining or intimating that that
was part of it.</p>
<p>I can agree with every argument that has been made upon this
floor for one general centralized head and one general central
organization. Mr. President and fellow delegates, I would rather,
I would prefer, if you please, to vote for a motion to make it
one organization of all the workers of the world if it was
practical. (Applause.) The only plea that I have to make now is
for a practical organization; an organization that is going to be
built up and succeed and go to the lengths that you want to go
finally. I want the delegates to remember this Preamble to the
constitution as you have heard it read, and see if my amendment
does not fit absolutely in place with that Preamble and
constitution, and that this wheel does not fit in it. In my
opinion the wheel limits this organization. One craft or trade
that has been mentioned that usually makes up a part of an
industrial group must go in that industrial group. If it does not
it will simply be turned over, as somebody has said, into another
industrial group. But nevertheless, it must go into some other
group of those thirteen. My amendment simply is, and really
carries out the intent and spirit of the constitution further on,
to give the Executive Board the power to really limit or
designate the limits of an organization. It does not fix any
limit. It simply says that it shall be made up of national and
international organizations organized upon the industrial plan,
and that it shall be left to the Executive Board of this
organization to say what plan they shall organize on.</p>
<p>In that connection, before I forget it, I want to see, fellow
delegates, that we are organizing something now that is the most
practical plan, the most feasible plan, to give us a year or two
years from now just exactly the groupings into which we should
form the workers of these United States&mdash;or of this
organization, rather. I believe that if we go into the field
purely and solely on the central idea that brought this
convention together, on the industrial plan, and leave the lines
of that industrial organization to the Executive Board, we will
be in a far better position a year hence or two years hence to
put this organization on the best possible foundation to bring
the desired results, the abolition, if you please, of the wage
system itself. I believe that just as soon as we go before the
mass of the workers with this division, you are immediately going
to build up a Chinese wall that you are not going to get over in
time to organize this movement. That is the only thing I am
afraid of, and I want to say that I want to see this movement go.
I have no desire except to build it up and see it go.</p>
<p>Now, there has somebody said&mdash;and it seemed to be the
general idea, the principal argument he made against the
amendment&mdash;that capital is organized world-wide and operates
world-wide. I want to say to every one of the delegates that have
made that statement, that the development of capital is
industrial, and you cannot deny it or you cannot prove it
otherwise. Whenever capital goes into the railroad business it
organizes a railroad company, and the railroad companies,
variously as they are grouped together, come together as railroad
companies. Whenever the same men who are interested in these
railway companies want to go into the newspaper business they
organize a separate company and go into the newspaper business,
and that company has absolutely nothing to do with the railroad
business. When they go into the restaurant business&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Tut! Tut! Tut!</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Well, I want somebody to prove otherwise, and I
will be very willing to have them do it&mdash;whenever they go
into the restaurant business they operate along the same line.
That is just exactly how capital is operating in the present
development of the economic system. That is the way, Mr.
President, I am satisfied every one of the originators of this
call had the intention that we should form this organization. I
do not believe it was the intention to do anything else except to
organize an industrial union.</p>
<p>Let me bring out another feature. Delegate Gilbert over here,
in attempting to align the hotel or laundry people with the
printers, attempted to say that identity of interest came in this
direction, that when the laundry people went on strike, was it
right to see the newspaper employes, for instance, continue to
set up and print lies about the laundry people? This organization
has already put it into the power, and we have all agreed on
it&mdash;put it into the power of the Executive Board that just
as soon as, within their judgment, another industry should be
called out in order to protect the interests of those on strike,
that that too shall be added to the strike number. We can group
one industry after an another until we get them all. That is
exactly the way that we ought to operate, and that is exactly in
line with the amendment that I made to this motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question now devolves on the
motion&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I ask the convention to kindly allow me just a
few more words.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN (Delegate J. C. Sullivan in the chair): The rule
is ten minutes. The, question is on the&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I move that his time be extended. I move a
suspension of the rules. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I move a suspension of the rules and that
Delegate Coates be given further time. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is that the rules be suspended and
that Delegate Coates be given further time. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for.) Those in favor of the question
will say aye. Contrary no. The motion seems to be carried. The
motion is carried. Delegate Coates has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to thank the delegates for this extension
of time. I want to say that perhaps to some of you I have seemed
to occupy the time of this convention, but I do not believe
anybody can say that I have occupied it uselessly. I have tried
to occupy the time at least according to the best light that I
had in me to see the proper thing to do. I want to bring this out
as fair as I possibly can, to get the delegates to realize what
we are doing. That is the only intent I have. I want to say that
I do not believe that I have another single solitary objection to
this entire constitution. The first amendment I made was serious
to a certain extent, but not to a very great extent; but this
thing I believe is a serious proposition. I believe that either
the failure or the success of this organization depends on the
very section of the constitution that we are going to adopt or
amend right now.</p>
<p>At the request of a delegate the pending amendment was read by
the Secretary.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: This means that every man and woman working in an
industry shall become a member of his or her organization, that
is, the organization of that industry. To put it plainly I want
the principle established that a man, woman or child that has
anything to do with the printing industry shall go into one
industry. I want the restaurant and hotel people to go into one
industry. I want them simply, just as soon as they come into the
same craft or the same calling where they work shoulder to
shoulder, where their every-day lives are bound
together&mdash;those are the people that I want to come into one
industry.</p>
<p>There was something said about the centralization of power. I
am not attempting to touch on that, because I said a few minutes
ago that the Executive Board of this organization will have all
power to wheel into line in every industrial controversy every
member of this organization. Now, let me ask&mdash;I have tried
to find out if I possibly can&mdash;how are the local unions of
these various groups to be organized? If I had this section here,
if I had the wheel very close to me, I could tell you the
fourteen or fifteen different organizations that are grouped
together in one group. Let us take the last one; that is the one
I remember more particularly. The highways, the people who work
on the streets and in the parks, the people who are musicians,
the people who are working in hotels and restaurants, the people
who work in laundries, the people who work in the printing
industry and two or three other industries, are grouped together.
And, my friends, that group, I want you to understand, simply
means one organization. This means a number of organizations
simply allotted in a group. It means that the laundry workers,
the street car drivers, the workers upon the highways and in the
parks, the musicians, the employes in restaurants and hotels, the
employes in the printing offices, shall all become individual
members of one great international organization. Here we are.
Here we have got a local organization of that group. You are a
printer; I am a clerk of some different kind. It means fourteen
or fifteen of us in a distinct branch. Are we going to make that
up that way, or are we going to separate all those various locals
as restaurant employes, as printers, street car drivers,
musicians and so on? If we do separate them&mdash;and some one
has made the remark that we will have local trade
unions&mdash;then you are doing the very thing perhaps that I
want you to do, only you are going about it a hundred times more
difficult. If you do not divide them up that way, I want to say
to you that just as soon as the street car men or the laundry
workers get into a difficulty that means a strike, that means a
per capita tax on the printers and the other fellows, then in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred he will be outvoted in his
local craft union and he will never get a strike and he will
never make a demand for a betterment of his condition. I want to
say to the delegates of this convention that that was the fatal
weakness of the Knights of Labor; that was the very thing that
destroyed the Knights of Labor, if you please. We had the clerk,
the building laborer, the street car man, the mill worker, the
laundry worker in every one of these assemblies of the Knights of
Labor. That was its very weakness, and after a while the K. of L.
found that it had to organize assemblies of different trades and
different crafts. That is the point that I am trying to make
clear to this convention; that if we are to be grouped in this
indiscriminate way we are not going to make any progress at all.
If you are going to group us simply this way nationally and then
separate us this way locally, you are going to destroy the very
scheme of industrial union that we are here laboring so hard to
bring about. I want to say to you delegates that there is only
one feasible way for this organization to operate on, and that is
to organize nationally or locally the industries as they are
grouped upon the industrial field, and then wheel into line
behind every section or every industry that is on strike or in
difficulty every other industry that comes within the confines of
this organization. (Applause.)</p>
<p>There are one or two features of this thing that I intended to
bring out, but I believe with my last illustration you catch the
idea that I am trying to bring out. You catch the scheme that I
believe you will find yourselves involved in if you vote for the
provision as brought in by the committee. And I want to say to
every one of these committeemen, every single solitary one, that
I will be the last on this floor to criticize their acts. I am
not standing on this floor criticizing the acts of the committee,
but I simply realize that they are a part of this convention and
that the convention as a whole has a right to criticize or amend
or change any work of any committee.</p>
<p>And now, Mr. President, in closing, I want again to appeal to
this organization to look at this if they can in a practical
light. A few days ago when I addressed this convention on the
purposes of this organization, I said that we want to fix in mind
the goal of this organization, the abolition of the wage system.
But I warned you at that time that in order to bring the wage
workers into an organization of that kind we must build a
practical organization; an organization that will go out here
to-morrow and begin the struggle for the bread and butter
question of to-morrow; an organization that will battle, if you
please, for a reduction of the hours of labor tomorrow, for an
increase of wages to-morrow, for the right of the workers of the
world to organize to-morrow; and I want the delegates to set all
this other sentiment aside and give us for the emancipation of
the workers an organization along the lines of the Manifesto that
has called us together. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I rise for information. Have I the floor to ask
a question?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I would like to ask Delegate Coates through the
Chair whether I understand him rightly to say that if his plan
goes through there would be nothing else to change in this
proposed program. Did I understand him to say that?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I said, as far as I know, I did not have another
single objection. There may be, of course, if I find myself
mistaken. I do not think so, however.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: My next question is whether&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Just a moment, before you ask me another. I am
not going to be tied up here. I meant that if there is something
that comes up that is not in conformity with this amendment I am
going to make it right.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I did not mean to tie him up; I simply meant to
understand. He is an intelligent man, and seemed to understand
the whole scope of the constitution, although he cannot have
preserved an accurate memory of every detail, but he must have in
his mind what that scheme is. Consequently in proposing a thing
of this sort I understand him that it is his opinion that his
plan can be substituted for these arbitrary groups and the whole
scheme is not thereby smashed.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I think not.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I understand you rightly.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: My next question to him is, how many heads would
there be in this industrial organization? Would we, according to
his plan, have to recognize an executive head, a central
administrative body? Of how many members would that executive
body consist, as, a result of his plan?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: He might ask me, if it takes me two-and-a-half
hours to go over to my room when will the next 4th of July occur?
It would occupy too much time to go over that now. If anybody
wants to go over to my room I will go into the matter fully.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Well, I am glad of your answer.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I think it is just about as sensible as the
question. How can I tell you? How can any man tell how many
groups there will be? That is just exactly the reason I
don&rsquo;t want any line drawn.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: That answer also suits me. I now want to ask the
delegate this third question&mdash;whether I understand him
rightly to say, that when the capitalists wanted to organize a
railroad company it is made up of railroad men?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, I didn&rsquo;t say any such thing.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: Let me put my question straight, and not cut my
question in two.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: And when they want to organize a newspaper they
gather as newspaper men and not as railroad men?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: You did not understand me in that way. I said
this, that when capitalists want to organize a railroad they
organize a railroad company. I did not say the men on the
railroad at all. I said that when they wanted to publish a
newspaper they organized as a newspaper company. That is what I
said. I don&rsquo;t understand the purport of all these little
foxy questions at all. (Laughter and applause).</p>
<p>At this point, at six o&rsquo;clock, the convention adjourned
until tomorrow, July 5th.</p>
