<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>TENTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Friday, July 7</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>Chairman Haywood called the convention to order at 9.30 A.
M.</p>
<p>On motion the roll call was dispensed with.</p>
<p>The minutes of the previous day were read by the
Secretary.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: The minutes referred to the motion made
by me yesterday that the monthly dues shall be not less than
fifty cents per month, but it does not state that that was the
motion, nor does it state that the motion was withdrawn upon the
distinct understanding with the Constitution Committee that the
constitution meant that the dues should not be less than fifty
cents per month, but could he more than fifty cents per month. I
would request the Secretary to have the minutes read in that
way.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Will the delegate kindly address the Secretary
and make that correction? If there is no other
correction&mdash;</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: There is no record in the minutes of the Paper
Hangers, No. 584, withdrawing from the convention. I would like
to have it recorded on the minutes.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Was that announced from the floor of the
convention?</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: It was announced as a question of special
privilege from the delegates.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will make that correction.</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: If the Paper Hangers have withdrawn, what are
their delegates doing here?</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I understood Delegate Coates to request that he
should be recorded as not voting on any proposition.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I did not make any such proposition as that at
all, but simply desired to have a little talk among the
delegates, and I requested in our absence to be recorded as not
voting on those sections of the constitution. I certainly did not
come into this convention with the intention of pulling out of it
and leaving it. There may be some that would like to understand
it that way, but that is not the way.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: A question of personal privilege. I wish
to state that the records on Brother Coates&rsquo; motion state
his position on the floor. He has no authority to speak, nor do I
think he intended to speak, for any other member of the
delegation representing the American Labor Union on the floor of
this convention.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Certainly not I desire to speak for myself.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Delegates Coates came up and announced to the
Secretary that he wished to be recorded as not voting on the
constitution as long as he was absent. That was his first
statement. But the statement of Delegate Coates was that he would
not vote on any part of the constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: That was the understanding.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Then he misunderstood it.</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: I occupied the chair at the time, and that was
the statement that I understood Delegate Coates to make, that
hereafter he would not vote on any part of the constitution, and
I so notified the Secretary while I was holding the chair, and I
think it was read correctly. If it is to be changed, all
right.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is that matter straightened out
satisfactorily?</p>
<p>DEL.. COATES: No, I just simply desired to state that I was
simply going to be absent from the session of the convention, and
I desired to be recorded. I knew most of the votes would be
carried viva voce and there would be no regular record, but as
long as I was absent I wanted to be noted as not voting; that was
all. That was the position, if you please. I certainly did not
want to deny myself the right to vote if I were here.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will note it.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I heard no mention made of the motion that I made
to amend the constitution to make the per capita tax five cents.
There was no mention of it made on the minutes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair remembers that proposition. Delegate
Smith made a motion to raise the per capita tax to twelve and
one-half cents. That motion was not seconded. Delegate Kiehn then
made a motion that it be reduced to five cents, which was
seconded, and it was put as an amendment to the original motion,
which was to adopt the section as read. Delegate Shurtleff then
made a motion that it be six cents; he made that as an amendment
to the amendment. Both the amendment to the amendment of Delegate
Shurtleff and the amendment to the original motion of Delegate
Kiehn were lost. The Secretary will please record it so.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is correct?</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: That is correct.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Are there any other corrections? If not, the
minutes will stand approved as corrected.</p>
<h4>COMMUNICATION.</h4>
<p>The Secretary read a communication from the Sixteenth Assembly
Branch of the Socialist Labor Party of New York, and it was
ordered placed on file.</p>
<h4>CREDENTIALS.</h4>
<p>Del. White, of the Credentials Committee, made a report,
presenting the credentials of John Matthews, representing the
Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers&rsquo; Union of America,
Local 830, Chicago, with a recommendation that the delegate be
seated with one vote.</p>
<p>On motion the report was concurred in and the delegate seated.
The Auditing Committee announced that it would be ready to report
in about two hours.</p>
<h4>REPORT OF CONSTITUTION, RESUMED.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Under the head of reports of standing Committees
we will take up the report of the Committee on Constitution. The
Secretary will read.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty, of the committee, read the next section, as
follows:</p>
<p>Section 3. International Industrial Divisions shall have one
delegate for the first 4,000, or less, of its members; for more
than 4,000 and up to 7,000 members they shall have two delegates;
for more than 7,000 and less than 20,000 members they shall have
three delegates; for more than 20,000 and less than 40,000
members they shall have four delegates; for more than 40,000
members and less than 80,000 members they shall have five
delegates; for more than 80,000 and less than 160,000 members
they shall have six delegates and for more than 160,000 members
they shall have seven delegates.</p>
<p>On motion of Delegate Gillhaus the section was adopted. The
next section, as follows, was read:</p>
<p>Section 4. Local Unions, chartered directly by the INDUSTRIAL
WORKERS OF THE WORLD, shall have one delegate for 200 members or
less, and one additional delegate for each additional 200, or
major fraction thereof.</p>
<p>On motion of Delegate Eisenberg the section was adopted.
Section 5 was then read, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 5. When two or more delegates are representing any
Local Union, International Union or Industrial Division in the
convention, the vote of their respective organization shall be
equally divided between such delegates.</p>
<p>Delegate Dinger moved the adoption of the section. Motion
seconded, and the section was adopted.</p>
<h4>BASIS OF REPRESENTATION.</h4>
<p>Section 6 was next read, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 6. Representation in the convention shall be based on
the National Dues paid to the General Organization for the last
six months of each fiscal year and each union and organization
entitled to representation in the convention shall be entitled to
one vote for the first fifty (50) of its members and one
additional vote for each additional fifty (50) of its members, or
major fraction thereof.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of this section. What
is your pleasure?</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I would like to ask the committee why they have
established that basis.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Brother Sullivan is more acquainted with
that.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I would like to ask this convention, because I
might offer an amendment. But possibly the committee would
explain it.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: It is to state definitely what
representation an organization is entitled to, or what vote. It
was not deemed advisable to prepare a constitution whereby an
organization possibly of thousands or hundreds of thousands
probably, would have too large a number so that business could
not very well be conducted. A basis of one vote for fifty
individual members we believed would be a fair proposition to
all, whether they be large or small unions. To my mind it is a
fair basis of representation, that for each fifty members or
major fraction of fifty that a union has, they are entitled to
one vote.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: The point I wanted to bring out was, why they
adopted the six months period. It states in there that the
representation permitted to organizations would be computed from
the per capita tax for the six months period preceding the
convention. I say, why that six months basis?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: One of the principal reasons was to prevent any
organization from padding the rolls. To give them a fair
representation on the membership that their organization
possessed, we believed six months was not too long, and we aimed
to strike an average, providing the union or organization had
been in existence that long.</p>
<p>On motion the section was adopted.</p>
<h4>DELEGATES&rsquo; CREDENTIALS.</h4>
<p>Section 7 was read, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 7. On or before the 10th day of March of each year the
General Secretary-Treasurer shall send to each local union and
International Industrial Division credentials in duplicate for
the number of delegates they are entitled to in the convention,
based on the national dues for the last six months.</p>
<p>The Unions and International Industrial Union shall properly
fill out the blank credentials received from the General
Secretary-Treasurer and return one copy to the General Office not
later than April 1. The other copy shall be presented by the
delegate to the committee on credentials when the convention
assembles.</p>
<p>Delegate Payne moved that the section be adopted as read.
Motion seconded.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: We are not quite ready; the time is so short
between the time when the General Secretary-Treasurer shall send
out these credentials until the time when they shall be returned,
that it makes it in many instances so that it cannot be acted
upon by the locals at all. There are hundreds of locals already
in existence, or will be after we organize them, and the time is
only one month between the time, not later than March 10, that
the General Secretary shall send out these notices, and April 1,
when they must be returned.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: The reason the committee saw fit to make those
dates was that the credentials were to be sent out by the
Secretary Treasurer based on the per capita tax or dues received
from the unions at the close of the fiscal year. The fiscal year,
under the constitution that you have adopted, closes on the last
day of February. Your committee deemed that about ten days was as
short a time as the Secretary could comply with the requirements
and send out the credentials in accordance as the unions were
entitled to them; and you have adopted a constitution providing
that the annual convention shall be held on the first Monday of
May. Now, in order to save time, in order to get down to business
in the convention at the earliest possible moment from a
financial point of view, a temporary roll must be prepared by the
Secretary of the general organization. Now, by stating that those
credentials shall be received at the general office by April 1,
it gives him thirty days, or practically thirty days, to do that
work. It does not say, however, that you cannot elect your
delegates to the convention during the month of January or
February if you desire, or any other time that may meet with your
approval. But so far as hundreds of local unions that only meet
once a month are concerned, I want to say that they are simply
unions in name. There is not a local union in existence that is
doing its full duty to its membership and carrying the banner of
industrial freedom that does not meet oftener than once a month,
and the sooner you get that idea out of your head and do business
and get together when the occasion requires it, at least once a
week, the sooner you will be doing your duty in the ranks of
organized labor.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: I cannot agree with the statement just made that
the unions that meet only once a month are not in favor of
industrial unionism. I consider that a direct insult to many
union men. There are just as good union men that meet once in two
months as meet once every week. I know there are lots of
them.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I take exception to the remark that there are
just as good union men that meet once in two months as those that
meet once a week. I say they are not doing their full duty as
union men. I have no apology to make for that statement. I repeat
that statement, that a union that does not meet oftener than once
a month is not only not doing, but cannot do its full duty to
organized labor. (Applause.)</p>
<p>The motion was then put and carried and the section
adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: I wish my vote to be recorded &ldquo;no&rdquo; on
that proposition.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Davis wishes to be recorded as voting
no. The Secretary will read.</p>
<h4>DELEGATES&rsquo; STANDING.</h4>
<p>The next section was read, as follows.</p>
<p>Section 8. Delegates to the convention from Local Unions must
have been members in good standing of their Local Union at least
six months prior to the assembling of the convention; provided,
their local union has been organized that length of time.</p>
<p>Delegates from International Industrial Unions to have a seat
in the convention, must have been members of their local union at
least six months and of their International Industrial Union at
least one year; provided it has been organized that length of
time.</p>
<p>The expenses of delegates attending the convention shall be
borne by their respective organizations.</p>
<p>On motion of Delegate Hopkins the section was adopted as read.
Secretary Hagerty read the next section, as follows</p>
<p>Section 9. Two or more local unions in the same locality, with
a total membership of 500 or less, may jointly send a delegate to
the convention, and the vote of said delegate shall be based on
the representation hereinbefore provided for.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Does that conflict with the provision that each
local may send a delegate; I mean, that provides for central
councils, I suppose.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Local Unions.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: You say two or more unions.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Local unions.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Local unions may join together and send one
delegate?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Yes, local unions directly connected with the
general administration.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Locals cannot send delegates in addition to that? I
mean the locals.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: This is intended to cover cases where the local
union is so small that it cannot afford a delegate itself.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: It does not offer an opportunity for the
delegates?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Presumably not, if the section be taken as read.
On motion the section was adopted.</p>
<h4>UNIVERSAL LABEL.</h4>
<p>Section 10 was then read, as follows</p>
<p>Section 10. There shall be a Universal Label for the entire
organization. Local unions, and other organizations must procure
supplies, such as membership books, official buttons, labels and
badges from the General Secretary-Treasurer, all of which shall
be of uniform design.</p>
<p>Delegate White moved that the section be adopted.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. SCHEIDLER: I would like to ask about the label. What is
meant by the label? Is it the same label as that of the American
Federation of Labor?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHEIDLER: Explain what is meant.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: The label, as Brother Trautmann outlines in his
indictment read before this convention, the American Federation
of Labor label, is a manufacturer&rsquo;s label, as for example,
the woodworkers&rsquo; label, the steel makers&rsquo; label, the
type setters&rsquo; label; they are manufacturers&rsquo; labels,
capitalist labels, and indicate a collusion between these craft
unions and the capitalists themselves, as Brother Trautmann
overwhelmingly demonstrated in his indictment. This unionism is
for the purpose primarily of showing the uniformity of the
organization, to show that all the workers recognize only one
symbol, irrespective of the craft or the nature of the commodity:
and it is the opinion of the Constitution Committee, I think,
that during this transition period some such a thing is necessary
to show that the workers will stand together and eliminate from
the minds of the workers all these craft distinctions that are
found in the other labels; not that it will be an essential
weapon in overthrowing the capitalist system, but during this
transition period as a matter of progress for the workers it
shall be used.</p>
<p>The section was then adopted.</p>
<p>Section 11 was read, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 11. There shall be a free interchange of cards between
all organizations subordinate to the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE
WORLD and any Local Union, or International Industrial Union
shall accept, in lieu of initiation fee, the paid up membership
card of any recognized labor union or organization.</p>
<p>Delegate Gillhaus moved that the section be adopted.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. PAYNE: I would like to ask, if a man has taken out a card
in one local and wants to join another local, is that accepted as
the initiation fee, or must he pay another initiation fee?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Not at all. This section distinctly answers that
question. I will read it again. (Section read by Delegate
Hagerty.)</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I don&rsquo;t hear any provision made for certain
qualifications. Suppose a man wants to transfer to another
division to work in that particular industry that he understands
absolutely nothing about. It may be dangerous to the lives of the
men that he is working with. There ought to be some certain line
of qualification. There is no provision made for that.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I think the brother&rsquo;s difficulty is
answered in the fact that in each international industrial
division the local union makes its own constitution governing its
own membership, as long as it does not conflict with the general
constitution. The section was then adopted.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will read.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: That is the end of the present report of the
Constitution Committee.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION.</h4>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I have prepared here a resolution that I wish to
present, covering the cases that have been brought out here by
Brother Powers and others, regarding the lower paid wage workers
that wish to organize. I do not wish to precipitate a lengthy
discussion on this, and if there should be such I will withdraw
this resolution:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resolved, That it is the sense of this constitution
that the rules regarding dues and initiation fees be
not&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just a moment, Brother Delegate. This
constitution has not yet been adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Well, I wish to insert this as an appendix or
some kind of a resolution in here, if it is permissible.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you desire to make this as an amendment? DEL.
DINGER: As an amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Does it set forth or specify the particular
section that you propose to amend?</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: This does not specify anything else, but simply
puts in black and white what is already the sense of this
Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Proceed with the reading of the resolution. DEL.
DINGER (reading):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resolved, That it be the sense of this constitution
that the rules regarding dues and initiation fees be not strictly
enforced in cases where the average wages ruling in any industry
proposed to be organized fall below $9 a week. In these cases the
amount of dues and fees shall be regulated by the General
Executive Board in accordance with the ability of said workers to
meet such financial obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I second the amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: If there is no objection, I move that this be
referred to the incoming Executive Board for their consideration.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I am satisfied with that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If you are satisfied with that, the motion is
that this resolution be referred to the incoming Executive
Board.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I am opposed to that part of the resolution where
it says that it shall be regulated by the Executive Board. I
think it ought to be regulated by the men and women themselves
that are to be organized, and not left to the Executive Board. I
believe in the self-government of the men that are organized. I
think they have the proper judgment as to their own ability to
pay their dues.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I wish to explain that. The wording of it
provides for that, where it refers to the ability of the workers
to pay or to meet such obligations; so that covers that, I
think.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Delegate, now, to avoid, any unnecessary
discussion or any mix-up in this constitution, the Chair will at
this time rule that this resolution is out of order until the
report of the Constitution Committee is disposed of. I will not
say that the resolution is not in order, but only until such time
as this constitution has been adopted. It is not within the
province of the Chair to say that this should not be got down so
as to conform with the very spirit of this resolution. Therefore,
at this time I will rule that out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. FRYE: By adopting this constitution report as a whole, it
would be impossible to insert any other clause in there.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has not yet been adopted as a whole. This is
not offered as an amendment. The motion is that the resolution be
referred to the incoming Executive. Board.</p>
<p>DEL. FRYE: I understand that to be an amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair is at this time ready to accept any
amendment to this constitution. The Chair will not entertain any
resolutions.</p>
<p>DEL. FRYE: I understand that, but I understood you to say that
a motion was in order to adopt this constitution. THE CHAIRMAN:
Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. FRYE: Now, I believe that the Constitution Committee have
done their work perhaps faithfully, but I believe they have
overlooked a number of matters that might facilitate the work of
this convention after we adopted them in that constitution. For
instance, I supposed the Constitution Committee had provided a
way by which amendments ought to be made in the convention, but
they have neglected that. If they had done that in this case and
we had had time, these delegates could have gone with their
recommendations to them and had them before them in writing and
acted on them intelligently. I believe something of that kind is
necessary.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I will state for information that the
Constitution Committee does not submit this as the finished
constitution. There are one or two other matters that have to be
discussed at the next meeting of the Constitution Committee, and
that will not take very long, which I think will probably cover
the present point.</p>
<p>DEL. DILLON: I move that the constitution be adopted as
amended.</p>
<p>Motion seconded by Delegate Dinger.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair will not entertain a second from any
delegate unless he rises and addresses the chair.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: For the benefit of Delegate Hagerty I would move
that the adoption of the constitution as a whole be deferred for
a few hours until they can make the necessary recommendations,
and let the committee get together to do that now.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I understand from what Comrade Hagerty says that
the constitution is not yet complete and that they have more to
do.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is not complete.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I do not see how we can do any more with respect
to the constitution. We have already adopted the last section
read, and we cannot adopt it as a whole until it is reported as a
whole. I think that is all we can do with respect to the
constitution.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I did not hear any second to that motion. DEL.
FERBER: I will second that motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the further consideration of the report of the Constitution
Committee be deferred until such time as they are prepared to
bring in a completed report. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chairman, I am in favor of the convention
voting by a roll call now on the adoption or rejection of so much
of this constitution as has been adopted by acclamation or by
roll call vote. If that is done it will be a guide for your
Constitution Committee to cover some other points that they have
not yet acted on; and I believe, and as one member of the
Constitution Committee I ask you to vote on the adoption or
rejection of this as it is now, by roll call.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Would it be in order to move that this
constitution be adopted by acclamation?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A motion is at the present time before the
convention to defer until the report of the committee is
complete.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Then it would not be in order?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: A motion to adopt by acclamation would not be in
order.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I wish to ask for information. A few days ago I
presented a resolution in regard to the eligibility of
membership, and I understood that that resolution had been
referred to the Constitution Committee, but up to the present
time I have heard no disposition of it. I wish to know at this
time whether I can bring in a like resolution or amendment, or
whether the Constitution Committee is going to tender another
report before the final adoption.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair is of the opinion that there has been
no provision made in the constitution to carry out the spirit of
the resolution. An amendment would be in order.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: If my recollection serves me right, there
are several resolutions before the Constitution Committee, and I
infer from the motion now pending that the Constitution Committee
desires an opportunity to complete its work and report on those
resolutions. I don&rsquo;t see why we should do anything else
except to give the Constitutional Committee a chance to complete
its work.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I only wished to ask this question because I
did not wish to take up any of the time unnecessarily, but I knew
that as the committee had not yet reported on this resolution
that I have referred to, and others, it had not been acted on;
therefore I would like to know, and that is the reason I asked
the question. However, if the report of the Constitution
Committee is not going to be acted on finally at this present
time, I am perfectly willing to wait until the resolutions are
read.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion at this time is that the further
consideration of the report of the Committee on Constitution be
deferred until such time as they bring in a completed report.
Those in favor of the motion will signify it by saying aye.
Contrary no. The Chair is in doubt.</p>
<p>At Delegate Dinger&rsquo;s request the Chairman stated the
motion again.</p>
<p>DEL. LUELLA TWINING: A point of information. I have a clause
that I would like to have inserted in the constitution. Shall I
present it before the convention now, or present it before the
Constitution Committee?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Not now, not before the Constitution Committee;
but after we are under the head of new business your amendment
may be presented.</p>
<p>DEL. TWINING: All right.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Those in favor of the motion will signify it by
saying aye. Contrary no. The ayes seem to have it, and the motion
is carried.</p>
<h4>COMMITTEES.</h4>
<p>The Committee on Resolutions and Committee on Ways and Means
announced no reports to make.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Committee on Literature and Press.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I think Comrade Brimble has something. Is he here
?</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: He has gone home.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I think Comrade Brimble has something. It is
something which was passed on by the whole committee, and they
are ready to report on it. Has that been read already? If it was,
I was absent.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It was.</p>
<p>The Committee on Organization announced that it had nothing
further to report.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Committee on Label and Emblem.</p>
<h4>LABEL AND EMBLEM.</h4>
<p>DEL. HENION: Your Committee on Emblem and Label desires to
make a verbal report, submitting to the convention an emblem
decided on by your committee. Your committee has decided upon an
emblem based on the sphere of a globe with the name of the
organization inscribed, &ldquo;Industrial Workers of the
World.&rdquo; Your committee recommends that such an emblem be
adopted by this convention for the official emblem of this
organization, and that the globe be in its natural colorings,
probably with the tint of green, and with a ribbon across the
globe which shall be red with the name of the organization,
&ldquo;Industrial Workers of the World,&rdquo; in white letters.
They further recommend that the official label of the
organization shall be based upon the emblem; that the union label
shall be practically the same as the emblem, only marked
&ldquo;union label.&rdquo; This is the verbal report. We have no
written report. We simply submit this for your consideration. If
this is adopted by the convention, of course we will present our
written report to the Secretary so as to be part of the minutes
of this meeting.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: In order to bring it before the house, I move you
that the report of the Committee on Label and Emblem be adopted
as the sense of this convention. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the report of the committee with the description of the emblem
and label be adopted as the sense of this convention.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I rise to a question of information. I would like
to know if the committee has discussed with the craftsmen from
various trades the possibility of utilizing that in certain
industries where it will have to be used in the form of a stamp
of different forms. In some cases the coloring will be well nigh
out of the question, I believe, and I ask if they have taken that
into consideration.</p>
<p>DEL. CRONIN: That has been done, I believe. Of course, the
committee realizes that the label may not, where it is stamped
on, be put on in different colors, but it can be used just the
same. Your constitution recommends, and the report has been
adopted by this convention, that we have a universal emblem and
label. Therefore, the committee desired to recommend for your
consideration something that was of a universal form for the
different crafts. It was also taken into consideration that we
should build the union label upon the proposition of representing
certain industries, or certain departments of an industrial
organization; but we came to the conclusion on account of the
action of the Constitution Committee, that it would be impossible
to do so.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: Another question of information. Do I understand
that the adoption of this report adopts this label or adopts
anything specially at all? It seems to me that this is something
that ought to go before the Executive Committee and ought to be
considered by them.</p>
<p>DEL. CRONIN: Refer it to the Executive Board. I don&rsquo;t
care which you do.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I would move to refer this to the Executive
Board, as far as I am concerned; it may be all right as it
is.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: Mr. Chairman and Brother Delegates, inasmuch
as we cannot take the world as it should be we must take it as it
really is. We know it is round, and we cannot put it on a piece
of paper so as to be round. Now, we might have on one side
Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, and on the other side
America, and the two hands between the old continent and the new
continent. This would be then the Industrial Workers of the
World. But if we are talking about the world, then to only get
the American side of it, we get only one part of it. I think it
would be plausible that we ought to have on one side the old
world and on the other side the new world, with the two hands
from the old world and the new world bound together, and that
would be, I think, the sentiment we are representing here.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: If it would be in order at this time, I desire to
offer an amendment that the report of the committee be referred
for the consideration of the incoming Executive Board.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I would second that. I just made that motion.</p>
<p>The motion to refer the report of the Label and Emblem
Committee to the incoming Executive Board was put, and the Chair
announced himself in doubt. A vote by show of hands resulted aye,
30; no, 18.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is carried; that is, the amendment.
Now the question occurs on the original motion; that is, that
this emblem be the sense of this convention, and that it be
referred to the Executive Board for their consideration. Are you
ready for the question? (Question called for). Those in favor
will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is
carried. Have you any further report from the Label and Emblem
Committee?</p>
<p>DEL. CRONIN: No further report.</p>
<p>The Committee on Ritual announced no report.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Unfinished business? New business?</p>
<h4>AMENDMENTS.</h4>
<p>DEL. TWINING: Is this the time for my amendment to the
constitution ?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Anything under the head of new business.</p>
<p>DEL. TWINING: I would like to have inserted in the
constitution a clause that appears in the Manifesto: &ldquo;The
Industrial Workers of the World is organized to subserve the
immediate interests of the workers and effect their final
emancipation.&rdquo; That does not appear in the
constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move to refer that to the Constitution
Committee. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Isn&rsquo;t that provision made in the
Preamble?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I do not know that it is in in just those
words.</p>
<p>DEL. TWINING: No.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
this amendment to the constitution be referred to the
Constitution Committee. Those in favor of the motion will signify
it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Mr. Chairman, I would ask that my resolution now
be taken up. I made the motion before.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, brother, your motion is offered as an
amendment to the constitution, as I understand.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I understand it was not referred, because it was
not the proper time.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No. It can be taken up at this time.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Will the Secretary read my resolution there? I
ask that it be read.</p>
<p>At the request of the Chairman, Delegate Dinger again read his
resolution, as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resolved, That it be the sense of this constitution
that the rules regarding dues and initiation fees be not strictly
enforced in cases where the average wage of the workers in any
industry to be organized falls below $9 per week. In these cases
the amount of dues and fees shall be regulated by the G. E. B. in
accordance with the ability of such workers to meet such
financial obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I move you that that be referred to the Committee
on Constitution. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
this be referred to the Constitution Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I think this should not be referred to the
Constitution Committee. I think this convention at this time
should act upon it. Of course we will afterwards vote upon it,
and I would like to hurry that into the constitution and have it
in before. We have found out that it is necessary to regulate
expenses all over the country in accordance with the earnings of
the people. It is not impossible to regulate expenses for a city
like Chicago, where they will get organized workingmen,
especially in the building lines, receiving fifty cents an hour;
they can very well afford to carry a high expense, which they are
doing. But among the carpenters we have found that all through
the country we have to regulate dues and initiation fees in
accordance with the earnings and the expenses in the different
localities. That plan has met with success all the time. I cannot
for the life of me see that we can place the expense at a high
standard upon people affiliated with this body, when they get, as
the delegate reported, not more than $8 a week. It is the same
thing, you may say, as to say that a man that has no money shall
pay no fare on the street car. It is just exactly the same thing.
But having those people carry equal expense organized in a place
in the country the same as where wages are good, would be a great
injustice, and I doubt if those organizations can carry that out
successfully. I hold that that is one of the main principles that
this Constitution Committee should look after, and I presented a
recommendation to that effect in the constitution meeting, that
we consider that particular point in the constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I would like to ask the consent of this body to
insert the words &ldquo;in any one locality,&rdquo; realizing
that in different localities the same trade may draw different
wages. So I would like to insert, with the consent of this body,
&ldquo;in any one locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There seems to be no objection to the words
being inserted.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: The reason I seconded that motion is that I have
also a resolution before the Resolution Committee providing that
the dues for female wage earners and foreigners be only one-half
that of other classes of labor.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Those in favor of referring this to the
Constitution Committee will say aye. Contrary no. The motion is
carried. Is there anything else under the head of new
business?</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: I think, if I am in order, that I will now move
you that at the assembling this afternoon we make a special order
of business of the election of officers for the coming year.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: I wanted to bring out something under the head of
unfinished business, but I did not get in here on time, and I
would like to bring it up again, with the permission of the
convention.</p>
<p>Motion of Delegate Ferber seconded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It occurs to me that that motion is out of order
at this time.</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Unless the adoption of the constitution is
effected, the election of officers is premature.</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There seems to be no objection on the part of
the convention. We may take up something else.</p>
<h4>WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE.</h4>
<p>DEL. HELD: There is a report of the Ways and Means Committee
which is on the Secretary&rsquo;s table, and which it is
absolutely necessary that this convention take up at an early
date, and that is about this stenographic report, which has been
deferred until the Constitution Committee had made a report. Now,
it seems to me that the report of the Constitution Committee has
gone far enough to enable the members of the Ways and Means
Committee or else the convention to take action upon the report
that has been deferred. Now, I would move, Mr. Chairman, that the
report of the Ways and Means Committee which has been deferred be
taken up again now. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you refer to the report with reference to
levying an assessment of one dollar?</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the Ways and Means Committee&rsquo;s report be taken up at this
time. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: It seems to me the Chair ruled once before that we
cannot take up that report of the Ways and Means Committee until
after that order of business has been disposed of relating to the
installation of unions and individuals into the new organization.
It seems to me that if this report contemplates the taxing of the
membership, the future membership of this organization, it cannot
be taken up very well until after the organization have regularly
installed themselves into the new organization as provided in the
rules on order of business. Now, the adoption of the constitution
does not mean the admission of those organizations. There is a
time set apart when organizations and individuals may be
initiated into the new organization, and it occurs to me that
this should lie over until after that time.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It occurs to me that the point of Delegate Hall
is well taken, and the report of the Ways and Means Committee
will be deferred until such time as the organizations are
regularly and permanently installed. Is there anything else under
the head of new business?</p>
<p>DEL. ALBERT RYAN: If I am in order I would like to ask if that
delegate is present in the hall who got up yesterday while we
were voting on some amendment to the constitution and made a
statement on behalf of the Paper Hangers that they withdrew from
the convention. He was here this morning and he didn&rsquo;t make
his full statement, and I would like to hear from him.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is the delegate from the Painters and Paper
Hangers present? (No response). Is there anything else under the
head of new business? If not, the Chair at this time will
entertain a motion to adjourn.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move that we adjourn.</p>
<p>DEL. BAKER: I have a proposition that I would like to offer
relating to the ratio of the vote: That a section be added to the
constitution distinctly stating that a majority vote shall decide
in all cases where a vote is taken, either by the Executive
Board, a local, national or international union or a referendum
vote of the entire membership of this organization.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This resolution will be referred to the
Committee on Constitution. Is there any other new business?</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Mr. Chairman, simply a suggestion under the head of
new business. If the convention will support me in it, I want to
ask that we appoint a committee to be furnished a copy of the
constitution as now framed, and assess ourselves twenty-five
cents apiece for it, and take it to a printing office so that
each member can take a copy home with him. If I can get a second,
I make that as a motion. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I desire to second the amendment of the brother
delegate. I think it would be well that we have copies of the
constitution so that no false statements or misrepresentations
may prevail in certain localities.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair has no objection to putting that
motion, but it would seem that it would be well to have the
report of the constitution complete first.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: When it is complete.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Will you kindly state your motion again?</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: That the delegates of the convention assess
themselves twenty-five cents apiece to pay for the printing of a
copy of the constitution so that we can have it to take hone with
us.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the motion. Are you ready for the
question. (Question called for). It has been regularly moved and
seconded that the delegates of this convention assess themselves
twenty-five cents apiece for the printing of the constitution so
that we can have a copy to take home with us.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I am of the opinion that that would not be the
proper action to take at this time. Reason would cause us to
believe that the organization will have copies of the
constitution printed as soon as may be, and I am not in favor of
the motion. I deem it unnecessary to enter into any discussion on
it.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I am in favor of having the constitution
printed and in favor of paying for it; and if it can he shown
that twenty-five cents is necessary to pay for it, I am willing
to pay that twenty-five cents or more; or even if this party
making the motion will show that the difference between the
amount paid for the constitution and the amount received will go
into the hands of your officers, I would be willing to pay for
that. What I would like to ask is this: Is it necessary to pay
twenty-five cents simply to cover the expense of one constitution
for each delegate?</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I believe my suggestion or motion carried with it
this, that we appoint a committee to have that done, and if they
find it is more or less they can regulate it.</p>
<p>The motion was put, and the Chair declared the result of a
viva voce vote in doubt. A raising of hands showed that the
motion was carried by a vote of thirty-nine to seven.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I will appoint on that committee Delegates Ross,
M. P. Haggerty and Saunders.</p>
<p>The Committee on Mass Meeting to be held on the evening of
July 7 asked for volunteers to distribute handbills advertising
the meeting.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there any further business before the
convention?</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I have got a question to ask. There is an old
saying that one fool can ask a question that it would take ten
wise men to answer. It seems to me, as an individual delegate,
now the constitution is almost completed, and yet it isn&rsquo;t
clear in my mind what report I can give that would be
satisfactory to my local assembly here. I certainly don&rsquo;t
like to give a report that they should not like. I am inspired by
the convention to give a report that shall be favorable to the
majority, but the majority in my organization is married to the
old organization, and the principal doubt will hinge upon how to
get a divorce.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: Get it. There is ground for a divorce.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I ask the question: Can a bona fide old
organization now join this organization and still be a member of
the Chicago Federation of Labor, or must it take a divorce first
from the Chicago Federation of Labor before they can marry in
here?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is a question that the Chair would think
can best be answered by the incoming Executive Board. I do not
want to undertake to answer it at this time, or until such time
as the perfect constitution is adopted.</p>
<p>The convention then adjourned until one o&rsquo;clock P.
