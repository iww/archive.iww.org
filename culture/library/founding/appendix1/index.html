<h1>RATIFICATION MEETING</h1>
<h3>Appendix, Part I</h3>
<h2>INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD, CHICAGO, JULY 7.</h2>
<h4>Speeches Delivered by:</h4>
<h4>THOMAS J. HAGERTY, THUS. POWERS, WM. ID. HAYWUUD, CHAS. 0.
SHERMAN, WILLIAM E. TRAUTMAN, PAT UNEIL</h4>
<h4>MISS LUELLA TWINING, Presiding.</h4>
<p>A meeting to ratify the work of the Chicago convention in
forming the Industrial Workers of the World, was held at
Brand&rsquo;s Hall, in that city, on Friday evening, July 7, at 8
o&rsquo;clock. The hall was completely filled, and many people
were compelled to stand throughout the meeting. The greatest
enthusiasm was manifested as the different speakers explained the
purposes of the organization. Miss Luella Twining, of Peublo,
Colorado, representing the American Federal Union, presided and
introduced the speakers.</p>
<p>In opening the meeting Miss Twining made the following
speech:</p>
<p>Fellow workers:&mdash;We have come to celebrate and ratify the
organization of the Industrial Workers of the World. Industrial
unionism stands for the solidarity of labor. Under industrial
unionism it would not be possible that the Western Federation of
Miners, when on strike, could be shot down by the militia hauled
by trainmen. Industrial unionism stands for solidarity. I will
not explain the principles of industrial unionism further, for
there is no one on the program but who is celebrated as an
exponent of these principles. The first speaker on the program
will be Thomas J. Hagerty, of the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club
of Chicago. You all know of him; he is a celebrated speaker.
(Applause.)</p>
<h4>ADDRESS OF THOMAS J. HAGERTY:</h4>
<p>After the applause had subsided, Hagerty spoke as follows:</p>
<p>I do not want to take up much of your time to-night, because I
know some of the men here, the every-day workers from the shop
and the mill and the factory, have a message to deliver to you
tonight that rings true, because it comes from the lips of
revolutionary workingmen. The preamble upon which they stand sets
forth very clearly the reason of this ratification meeting,
namely, that there are two classes in this country, and that they
have nothing in common. Many of the workers have been misled into
the belief that they have many things in common with the shirking
class. I have met men, workers, who said to me: &ldquo;Why, I
lntvcn&rsquo;t any objection against my employer; he is a good
fellow; wht&rsquo;:i he meets you on the street he shakes hands
with you just the same as with any other sort of man, and I am
opposed to this talk about war between the classes. That is not
true, because I am well treated by my boss.&rdquo; The man who is
in this state of mind towards the class struggle reminds me
always of a story that I am fond of telling. It was originally
told me by a long, lank, raw-boned Kentuckian on the Oklahoma,
Choctaw and Gulf Railway in Indian Territory three summers ago.
It is very hot in the Indian Territory in the summer time. One of
the speakers who will talk to you is from Arkansas, and he can
tell you something about Indian Territory alter a while. The man
who told me the story said he noticed a fellow sitting under a
water tank one day, scratching himself very vigorously. After a
good deal of squirming around he finally brought something to the
light and looked at it very carefully and cautiously and intently
from every point of view, and then just as carefully put it back
again in the same place. The man standing alongside of him turned
around and said: &ldquo;Why, you blamed idiot, why didn&rsquo;t
you kill the darned thing?&rdquo; The first fellow looked around
at him in amusement and said: &ldquo;Why, that wasn&rsquo;t the
one that was biting me.&rdquo; (Laughter). And so there are
workingmento-day who keep on putting the parasite back because it
does not happen to be the particular one that was biting
(applause).&mdash;failing to realize that the whole parasite
system is draining their life blood, and thinking, because a
particular parasite is not at a particular time biting them, that
therefore there is no class struggle.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World, then, is founded on the
class struggle. Its members know from their own bitter experience
just what it means to be exploited. They are not able always to
put their. knowledge into fine technical phrases; they do not
know very much about that sort of thing, but they know what they
want. They know that the other fellow is now putting the boots to
them, and they want to wear the boots themselves. They know when
they go out upon the streets that the man who does the least work
has the most of the good things. They walk out on Sundays with
their wives and their little ones, and they see the wives of
their employers rustling in silks and satins. They hear the rush
of the oncoming red devil wagon and the toot of its horn, and
they know instinctively that between the class that have all
these good things and do not labor for them, and their own class
which has none of these things, their own class which must get
out of the way of the wheels at the toot of that horn, their own
class which is in calico when the other class is in
silks&mdash;they know that between these two classes there is a
war and a struggle, and that that struggle must go on, as the
Preamble setting forth the principles of the Industrial Workers
of the World states, &ldquo;until all the workers come together
on the political as well as on the industrial field and take and
hold that which they produce by their labor, through an economic
organization of the working class without affiliation with any
political party.&rdquo; (Applause). They know what they want, and
when a sufficient number of them know what they want, then the
Industrial Workers of the World proposes, in conjunction with all
other workers, through united public action to take and hold that
which belongs to them.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World have nothing to conceal
from the rest of their fellow workers. They do not smother their
purpose in any fine American Federation of Labor phrases about
the community of interest between the capitalist class and the
working class. They stand four-square to the true interests of
the workers, on a platform that is unmistakable, on a platform
that recognizes no aristocracy of labor, that recognizes a T-bone
beefsteak has as much nourishment value in it to the stomach of a
hod-carrier as it has to the stomach of the most aristocratic
Typographical Union man (applause), and that fundamentally, at
bottom, there are the same human wants of food, shelter and rain.
It is agreed upon all those things. It is agreed on them, not
because some of the workers are better paid than others, but it
is agreed upon them because these are the ground demands of the
working class to-day, and until they are obtained the working
class must remain in want, hunger and misery. It is primarily an
educational movement to show the workers that their interests are
common in every part of the world.</p>
<p>The other day, according to the newspapers, the International
Harvester Company was involved in Odessa; some of its property
was in danger. The Russian workingman out on strike in Odessa is
exploited by the same employer as the workingman out on strike in
this city here at the works of the McCormick Harvester Company
and those of the International Harvester Company. There is a
world-wide exploiting class, and so any movement against that
class must stretch out all over the world. (Applause). The
letters received at this convention from foreign industrial union
movements, from France, Germany, Denmark, show conclusively that
this is not something new in America. About five years ago in
Spain such a convention, such a congress of the workers as has
been holding here during the past week was held in Madrid, and
the last congress held last month in Madrid issued a manifesto
along the same lines as the manifesto that called the workers to
this convention, and for the same ultimate object. So that in
spite of petty national lines, in spite of international division
lines, the workers the world over are coming together on the
ground of their common working class interests, without regard to
race, color, creed or flag, and they are coming together because
the earth and all that the earth holds and all its possibilities
are theirs&mdash;are theirs by right of muscle, are theirs by
right of labor, and they propose to take them and to enjoy them
for their class, from antipode to antipode. (Applause.)</p>
<p>The Chairwoman:&mdash;The next speaker will be Thomas Powers,
of the textile workers, of Providence, R. I. You all know the
condition of the textile workers. I take great pleasure in
introducing Thomas Powers, who will speak to you of them.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>ADDRESS OF THOMAS POWERS:</p>
<p>Madam Chairman and Fellow Workingmen of Chicago :&mdash;I
never indulged the thought that I would ever become important
enough to be introduced at a meeting of this kind. A workingman
twelve hundred miles east of this great city comes here to make
common cause with workingmen twelve hundred miles to the west of
this city. From all points of the compass workingmen have come to
this city to make common cause with one another. And what is the
common cause? The common cause is that which grows out of the
organization of capital; or, I might say, to put it more plainly,
the rampant nineteenth century madness of greed which it induces.
Do you know&mdash;of course you do&mdash;and I want to tell you
that I talk about it in order that you may know&mdash;as I know
and every man in Rhode Island knows&mdash;that the successful man
of to-day, the successful man who is measured as we measure
success to-day, by his dollars, thinks, and is sustained in the
thought, in his every act by the so-called intellectual class,
that it is his right and that it is perfectly proper that he
should look upon society as something for him to prey upon,
something for him to exploit. To what end? To the end that he
might have countless dollars, that he might have power. Let as
look at what he has done with his countless dollars. Let us look
at what he has done with his power. Take up the daily papers of
Chicago to-day, and you will find that he has dominated the halls
of the legislature of this State. Take up any paper or read the
Associated Press dispatch news and you will find that this
money-grubber has dominated the institutions of American
citizenship from one end of this land to the other. His curse,
his demoralizing influence, flows from the executive chair of the
nation into the sewer department. (Applause). It is for this that
he is piling up his dollars. It is for this that he is seeking
power. Was it for this that the men of the American revolution
pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor? Was
it for this that the men at Concord bridge in 1776 and the men at
Lexington Green, the men on whose hands were the callouses that
resulted from driving the plow and using the hammer, spilled
their blood in order to give this republic birth? Was it for this
that this government was instituted, to breed the most accursed,
the most demoralizing horde of money-grubbers that the world has
ever produced? (Applause.)</p>
<p>This has grown out of what we call capitalism. It is to fight
this, among other things, that we are organized. And this same
cold-blooded, bloody thing is at work in Ireland, is at work in
England, is at work in France, in Belgium and in Germany. I
believe there is not a part of the civilized world where the
influence of this coarse, this cunning, this brutal man, this
money-grabber, is not felt. You hear in common talk this old
adage, that in the society of to-day it is every man for himself
and the devil take the hindmost. Now, don&rsquo;t you believe any
such thing. The devil will do nothing of the kind. The devil
wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with the hindmost, he
wouldn&rsquo;t know where to put him. (Laughter). The hindmost,
if many of them got into his dominions, would be the means of
dethroning him. But instead of taking the hindmost, he will take
the foremost, for he will find them men of his own heart.
(Applause). Yes, and he will use them to perpetuate his reign. He
will give them places and use them for ornamentation in the
council chambers of hell. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Now, workingman of Chicago, I am a textile worker, and I
don&rsquo;t pretend to understand anatomy; I know nothing about
that knowledge that physicians possess, but there is not a day,
there is not a time that I walk the streets of the city in which
I live but I am pained by the spectacle that is presented by the
men and women who follow the calling I follow. They are pale,
they are emaciated, they are not properly fed, they do not earn
enough to give them good food in order that they might have good
blood, in order that they might be strong; and in the city of
Fall River it is even worse than it is in the city in which I
live. I often wonder how it is that a physician can live in Fall
River. I often think how a man who can read, who can understand
what this spectacle means, how he can live and have this horrible
sight presented to him day after day; women with thin faces and
thin arms, little boys eleven and twelve years of age, with their
thin arms and their thin legs&mdash;little old men. They are
exploited, and who is the exploiter? Why, he is a refined
gentleman&mdash;a capitalist. (Applause). When he comes out on
the street you would know him by the cut of his clothes and his
refined appearance. You will see him come into the mill at eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and you will know that he had a
bath before he left his family hotel. That man can fatten; that
man can live and send his children to the private school; he can
send them to the college, and he can do this and see other
children denied even the substance to produce strong and healthy
growth. This I see every day. I do not need to go to any other
man to furnish me with the reason why I ought to be in this
revolutionary organization of the working class. I can see it
everywhere I go.</p>
<p>A few nights ago in your city I was asked to speak at one of
those meetings out on the street corner, and a number of men
assembled around there, and I thought that if only those men
could be lined up and walk the streets of Chicago what a
spectacle they would present, and what a story their appearance
would tell. Would I could write the story their appearance would
tell, that story would put our so-called boasted civilization to
shame. There were men assembled around that meeting whose necks
are in that crooked position (illustrating), whose shoulders are
pulled out of shape, who have the ox appearance, men who are
deformed by the cursestained hard labor which they do.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>We have asked that these little children in the mill be
protected by the law. We have asked that laws be made to prohibit
their employment under twelve and fourteen years of age. But as I
said, the &rsquo;get there&rdquo; class, the men who are going to
get there, who are going to keep out of this impoverished
world&mdash;the employing class&mdash;what have they done? They
have brought about such a state of affairs through their
influence among the machine politicians that these laws are not
enforced. There is not a State in this country that enforces its
child labor laws, because of the influence of the employing class
among the legislators.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what has happened in Fall River; it was told
to me by one of the spinners there. &rsquo;Twenty-five years
ago,&rdquo; this man said, &ldquo;we had 2,000 men in our union,
spinners, and there has never been a time since then that a
spinner working in that city did not belong to our union,&rdquo;
and he felt proud of his union. He was asked &ldquo;how many
power mules have you here now?&rdquo; and he answered
&ldquo;About 350.&rdquo; Now, this is what has happened: In these
twenty-five years the number of mules had decreased from 2,000 to
350. What has become of them? They have been carried to the scrap
heap, and their places have been taken by the spinning frame, and
the father is out on the street looking for a job at whatever he
can get, and the child is in the mill working at spinning. I want
to tell you about the loom, the Draper loom. No one would nave
been more surprised at this than the textile worker of twenty
five years ago. To-day in the town of Waterville a cotton weaver
is running forty looms. Do you know what that means? Well, that
means ten times as many looms as the weaver in India ran ten or
twelve years ago. That means four times the number of looms that
the most expert cotton weaver ran in the city of Fall River ten
years ago, and is nearly four times as many as they are running
there to-day, but that loom has not come there as yet. If the
manufacturers in the cotton industries in this country decided to
keep in employment the present number of weavers and would give
to each the number of looms which it is possible for them to run
with this new loom, they would have to increase the other
departments of the plants about three-fold. I doubt very much if
there is cotton enough grown in the world to supply the
production which is made possible through the introduction of
this loom.</p>
<p>Now, then, the men who compose this organization take these
things into consideration. They recognize the changes and
improvements which result through invention, and they tell the
workingman that he must band together with every other
workingman. They tell him that his cause is not only common with
the man in another department, in another branch of trade, but
they tell him that his cause is common with the men in every
country in the world. Workingmen, this organization, this
Industrial Workers of the World, will do more than educate people
on economic lines. It will open up to their minds many thoughts
which are sleeping now. It will open up in their minds thought
that will dispel the national prejudices which have caused them
to stand apart. It will little by little tell them this story
&ldquo;You Englishman, your great-grandfather went over to
Ireland and he fought the Irishman; and he did it for whom? Why,
for the king. He did it to uphold the throne of William of
Orange. And don&rsquo;t you know that this king is God&rsquo;s
anointed ? Did this thought ever strike you ? Yes, he is
God&rsquo;s anointed, because God created the first king, and the
first king was the devil, and every king that has succeeded has
been a devil also, and their entire wake has been a sea of blood.
They have caused prejudice to run on generation after generat1on,
to keep apart the sons of the men who met in the death grapple,
and who when it was all over went home to shed the tears and pay
off the war debt. This organization will spread the thought that
will remove that prejudice. It will tell the workingmen how they
have preyed upon each other to promote capitalist interests, how
they have been played upon by those men who have been responsible
for their condition, and will tell them also how they are preyed
upon by the wise American capitalist class. Do you know that
there is nothing which has more to do with planting in the mind a
refined madness than capitalist greed? When you see this American
flag waving, did you ever stop to think what it represents? Did
you ever stop to think of what is going on in the country over
which it floats? On the Fourth of July I saw oil the State House
in the City of Boston the great flag waving, and three months
before that time one of the most powerful men in that State
openly declared that the members of that Legislature were sold
like fish in the fish market (applause). Within the shadow of
Bunker Hill this is going on. Down in Plymouth, I stood upon the
celebrated Plymouth Rock that they call the birth-place of the
nation, and I stood on the streets of that city and saw there in
the faces and on the bodies of the men who passed along the
evidence of the work of this nineteenth century industrial
pirate, the money-grubber&mdash;the capitalist. Everywhere you go
you can see him. He has no country, he has no God, he has no
love, no consideration. The only thing that he knows, the only
thing that he works for, is the wealth power of the world.
Mankind is his field of prey. Organize to overthrow him, is what
we have done.&rdquo; (Applause.)</p>
<p>The Chairwoman:&mdash;The next speaker will be William D.
Haywood, president of the Western Federation of Miners. In
Colorado the capitalists hate him. When Peabody spoke of William
D. Haywood as a labor fakir he represented the capitalist class
and voiced the thought of Gompers. I take great pleasure in
introducing William D. Haywood, president of the Western
Federation of Miners. (Applause.)</p>
<h4>SPEECH OF WILLIAM D. HAYWOOD:</h4>
<p>Fellow Workers:&mdash;The first thing that it is necessary for
me to say to you this evening is to correct the introduction of
out little chairlady. I am not the president of the Western
Federation of Miners, but am holding the position of
secretary-treasurer at the present time. The president of the
Western Federation of Miners is as close to me, however, as any
man call be, and I very much regret that you will not this
evening have the opportunity of listening to the president; a man
who has suffered as much for the cause of labor as any man in
this country was ever called upon to suffer.</p>
<p>The theme for this evening is &ldquo;Industrial
Unionism.&rdquo; For near</p>
<p>ly two weeks there have been assembled in this hall over 2 men
and women gathered in your city for the purpose of organizing,
not a rival to the American Federation of Labor, not a rival to
any other organization&mdash;but to organize a labor movement for
the working class. Those of us who have studied conditions in
this country recognize the fact that up to the launching of this
organization there was not a labor organization in this country
that represented the working class. (Applause). This industrial
union is an organization that stands with the gates wide open to
take in every man and woman, and, if necessary, child, that is
working for wages with either brain or muscle. (Applause). This
organization is broad enough in its scope to take in the men who
works in the sewer, or our journalistic friends here oil the
platform who think that they are professional men. (Applause).
There are a great many professional men who don&rsquo;t know the
difference between a professional man and a laborer. For
instance&mdash;begging the pardon of the journalists&mdash;there
are some scrub reporters that are working on a police assignment
who imagine they are professional men working for a salary. They
get about $1 a week, and are lucky at that. There are a great
many skilled artisans that are getting $350 and $4 a day, who
recognize their position as workingmen, and their remuneration,
their compensation, as wages. (Applause). I simply want to
demonstrate that a $ a day hod-carrier is just as good as a $15 a
week reporter, and it does not make a bit of difference whether
lie is a negro or a white man. (Applause). (A
voice:&mdash;&rdquo;As long as he is a union man&rdquo;). It does
not make any difference whether he is an American or a foreigner.
(Applause). Although I am an American, it is no fault of mine. I
am still of the opinion that an American is just as good as a
foreigner as long as he behaves himself, arid no longer.
(Laughter.)</p>
<p>The organization that has been launched in your city
recognizes neither race, creed, color, sex, or previous condition
of servitude. (Laughter). We came out of the west to meet the
textile worker of the east. We men of the west are getting more
wages per day than those men are getting. We recognize the fact
that unless we bring them tip to our condition they of necessity
will drag us down to theirs. (Applause). We propose that this
industrial movement shall provide, for every man and woman that
works, a decent livelihood. Is that something worth working for?
Now, understand me&mdash;or rather, do not misunderstand me. I do
not mean that this organization is going to improve the condition
of purely the skilled workers, the bricklayer, the carpenter or
the type-setter; but I mean that we are going down in the gutter
to get at the mass of the workers and bring them up to a decent
plane of living. (Applause). I do not care the snap of my finger
whether or not the skilled workers join this industrial movement
at the present time. When we get the unorganized and the
unskilled laborer into this organization the skilled worker will
of necessity come here for his own protection. (Applause). As
strange as it may seem to you, the skilled worker to-day is
exploiting the laborer beneath him, the unskilled man, just as
much as the capitalist is. (Applause). To make myself better
understood, the skilled laborer has organized for himself a
union, recognizing that in unity there is strength. If* has
thrown a high wall around that union which prohibits men from
joining the organization. He exacts that a man to become a member
of the labor union must of necessity serve an apprenticeship to
develop his skill. What for? For the benefit of the union? No,
but for the benefit of his employer, who is a member of the
Citizens&rsquo; Alliance (applause), and who is trying to crush
wit of existence that same union that has endeavored to
6ei,elni&rsquo; skilled mechanics for the benefit of the
capitalist class. (Applause). What I want to demonstrate to you
is that the skilled mechanic, by means of the pure and simple
trades union, is exploiting the unskilled laborer. I think that
will be easy for me to do. The unskilled laborer has not been
able to get into the skilled laborer&rsquo;s union because that
union exacts that a man must needs have served a term of years as
an apprentice. Again, there are unions in this country that exact
an initiation fee, some of them as high as $500. There is the
glass blowers&rsquo;, to be specific, how long would it take a
man working for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter a day and
providing for a family, to save up enough money to pay his
initiation fee into that union? Why, he might just as well figure
on a trip to &ldquo;Paree&rdquo; To demonstrate the point that I
wanted to get at, it is this: That the unskilled laborer&rsquo;s
wages have been continually going down, that the prices of
commodities have been continually going up, and that the skilled
mechanic through his union has been able to hold his wages at a
price and upon a scale that has insured to him even at these high
prices a reasonably decent living; but the laborer at the bottom,
who is working for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter a day, has
been ground into a state of destitution. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Now, ladies and gentlemen, this condition does not exist as
generally throughout the west as it does here and farther east,
and especially is this true in the camps t&rsquo;here the Western
Federation of Miners is thoroughly organized, because in those
camps we have established a minimum wage of $ a day for every
mail or boy that is employed around the mines. Now we have no
objections to a man getting as much more as he can, hut we exact
that he shall get at least those decent wages that will justify
him in maintaining a family and doing it respectably, and we are
coming here to Chicago and we are going further east to see if it
is not possible to bring the common laborer up to a plane
something like we enjoy in the ruining camps of the west.
(Applause). And that can only be brought about by organization.
Not an organization with $500 initiation fee; not an organization
that demands that you shall serve a three years&rsquo;
apprenticeship to any trade for the benefit of a member of the
Citizens&rsquo; Alliance, but an organization that has the doors
wide open so that any man that is working at any calling can come
in and join hands with us. (Applause). Though we are enjoying
very good conditions, we recognize, as I stated before, that our
conditions can only be maintained by upholding the conditions or
endeavoring to uplift the fellow who is at the bottom.</p>
<p>Now, don&rsquo;t get discouraged, folks, you of the working
class, because here in Chicago you have lost some strikes.
Remember that you never could have lost those strikes if you had
been organized industrially as the workers in Russia are
organized (applause)organized into an organization that takes in
every man, woman and child working in an industry. For instance,
in the packing plants, the butchers&rsquo; organization was one
of the best organizations in this country, reputed to be o,ooo
strong. They were well disciplined, which is shown from the fact
that when they were called on strike they quit to a man. That is,
the butchers quit, but did the engineers quit, did the firemen
quit, did the men who were running the ice plants quit? They were
not in the union, not in that particular union. They had
agreements with their employers which forbade them quitting. The
result was that the butchers&rsquo; union was practically totally
disrupted, entirely wiped out Now, presuming that every man
around the packing houses, from the printer to the pig sticker,
belonged to one union; that when they went out on strike the
engineers, firemen and men that ran the ice plants all quit; that
millions of dollars of produce were in a state so that it would
rapidly perish, don&rsquo;t you believe that those packing house
companies would have capitulated? Don&rsquo;t you believe that if
to-day the organized workers of your great city would not go on
strike, but that they would stay home for three or four days,
that the teamsters would win the strike that they are now engaged
in? (Applause). One union man is no better than another union
man, and any union man that will stand back because a company has
an agreement with him, and who will scab on his fellow union man,
he may be a union man, but in my opinion he is a technical scab.
(Applause). On the Santa Fe Railroad some time ago the
telegraphers went out on strike, and they presented their
grievance to the company. The company says: &ldquo;We cannot do
anything for you.&rdquo; They apvealed to the different
brotherhoods of railroad men. Those various brotherhoods
appointed their grievance committees to see the management. When
they went to the management the management said to them:
&ldquo;Gentlemen, haven&rsquo;t we schedules with you?&rdquo; The
committee said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
company, &ldquo;you carry out your schedules with us and we will
attend to the telegraphers.&rdquo; They attended to the
telegraphers to the extent tlt there is not a &rsquo;Inloxl
telegrapher on the Santa Fe system. Then the machinists went on
strike on the same system, and they appealed to the brotherhoods,
and the brotherhoods in the same manner appealed to the
management The management called their attention to their
agreements, and told them to attend to their business and carry
out the rates and rules of those schedules, and they would attend
to the machinists; and the machinists to-day are the victims of
the sacred contract of the union man with his employer. There
never was a contract so sacred, drawn up between a union and an
employer, but what the employer would break it if he felt it was
to his interest to do so. (Applause.) So that in my opinion and
in the opinion of the delegates that have assembled here, no
union will have the right or he empowered to eider into a
contract with any company or corporation unless that contract is
in keeping with and to the welfare of the general labor movement.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>Some of the labor leaders of this country have been quoted as
saying that it is possible for the capitalist, the
corporationist&mdash;or the employer, if you will&mdash;to get
together with the working-men and adjust the conditions that
exist between them. Some of them have said that if we only sit
down at a table and look each other in the eye and talk these
matters over that there would never be another strike. Well, now,
that proposition of looking each other in the eye suggests to me
that out in Colorado and further west this is a sort of a poker
player&rsquo;s game. (Laughter).</p>
<p>A man sitting behind a full hand of four aces looks the other
fellow in the eye and tries to make him believe he has only got
two deuces. (Laughter.) Now, the capitalist is always ready to
sit down and look the other fellow in the eye, and he has always
got the best of it. Why? Because he owns the tools that the other
fellow works with. (Applause). Without the tools the other man
could not live, and when a man or a company or corporation has
possession of the tools, the means of production, the economic
power, the means of life, he has your life absolutely in his
possession. (Applause). Why, folks, rather than be one of the
residents of the ghetto down here, a place that I was through
last night I would rather be a big buck nigger. on a plantation
in the south be/ore the days when chattel slavery was wiped out.
Why? Because&mdash;size me up pretty well now&mdash;I would be
worth about !td= to a plantation holder. It would be to his
interest to provide me with good shelter, with suitable clothing,
with proper food, with proper medical attendance, because I
represent to him a monetary value of $1,000. Suppose T was to go
to some plantation owner to-day-and we have not any slavery in
this country.</p>
<p>e would size me up and he would say: &rsquo;You are worth just
about</p>
<p>&yen;Si 4O * day to work on this ranch. If you get sick you
take</p>
<p>cut ga.i,Jf If &rsquo;uu die it is no loss to me. I care
nothing about your family. Your little pickaninnies, there is no
value to them. Your little red-headed girl does not represent
five cents of value to me.&rdquo; Is this system more cruel than
that of slavery days? A hundred thousand times more. (Applause).
The wage system is worse than chattel slavery.</p>
<p>Now, are there any of you who feel that your interests and the
capitalist&rsquo;s interests are identical? Don&rsquo;t you know
that there is not an employing capitalist or corporation
manufactory in this country that if it were possible would not
operate his or its entire plant or factory by machines and
dispose of every human being employed? (Applause). The
corporation does not hire you. The employer never looks at your
face; he never looks you in the eye. He cares nothing about your
feelings. He does not care anything about your surroundings. He
cares nothing about your twinges of anguish or your heartaches.
He wants your hands and as much of your brain as is necessary to
attach yourself to a machine. (Applause). Remember, that to-day
there are no skilled mechanics. Down in the packing house there
are no butchers. There is a train of specialized men that do just
their part, that is all. The machine is the apprentice of
yesterday; the machine is the journeyman of to-day. The machine
is rapidly taking your place, and it will have you entirely
displaced pretty soon, and it is a question as between you and
the capitalist as to who is going to own and control and
manipulate and supervise that machine. (Applause.)</p>
<p>That is the purpose of this industrial union. Now, et no man
make a mistake. While we are going to do everything that we can
to improve and take advantage of every opportunity that is
offered to us to improve the condition of the working class as we
go along, the ultimate aim of this organization is to get control
of the supervision of industry. (Applause). We propose to say to
the employing class what the hours of labor shall be and what the
remuneration shall be. We are the people who do the work, and we
have got tired of those who do nothing but shirk, reaping all of
the benefits. That is the definition of industrial unionism; the
absolute control and supervision of industry. And when the
working class are sufficiently well organized to control the
means of life; why then the system that the speaker before me
told you about, the ownership of legislatures and senates and,
militias and police will be of little avail to them, because a
condition such as exists in Chicago at the present time could not
exist: The army or police that would raise a hand, a club or a
gun aga&rsquo;nst a workingman would have to leave this community
or starve to death. (Applause). And we are going further than
that. We are going to say to the employer: You must take your
place in the productive system of this country or you will
starve. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Now, remember, that we fellows out west were once east; that
if we don&rsquo;t know what we are going up against, our fathers
probably did. My great great-grandfather lived in Boston. My
great-grandfather came as far west as Ohio. My grandfather lived
in Iowa. My father carried the mail in Colorado before there was
a railroad. I have been still farther west, until they told me
that it was only a few miles to the rolling billows of the
Pacific, and I concluded that the Haywood family had better turn
hack, that we had been driven to the frontiers until there were
no more frontiers. So I have come back to Chicago, and am still
on the frontier; that is, on the frontier of this industrial
union movement, which I hope to see grow throughout this country
until it takes in a great majority of the working people, and
that those working people will rise in revolt against the
capitalist system as the working class in Russia are doing
to-day. (Great applause.)</p>
<p>The Chairwoman:&mdash;I called Brother Haywood president
inadvertently, but you will all admit that while he has not been
president he would make a good one. The next speaker on the
program will be C. 0. Sherman, secretary of the International
Metal Workers. (Applause.)</p>
<h4>ADDRESS OF Cass. O. SHERMAN:</h4>
<p>Madam Chairman, Sisters and Brothers :&mdash;As stated by the
previous speakers on the platform this evening, we have
participated for the last two weeks in a convention that has been
held in this hail. I do not know as it is necessary to make any
apology when I tell you that we have been so busy that we owe an
apology to the laundry girl and to the barber, as we did not find
tijie to look after either one of them. We have no apology for
the birth of this international organization known as the
Industrial Workers of the World. We participated in this
convention, and we propose to father this organization because we
believe the condition of the producing class demands an
organization of this character. Its basic principle is the class
struggle, and we expect the organization to be built up with the
producing class, such portion of them as realize at the present
time that there is a class struggle. (Applause). We will say,
however, that there is one fundamental principle of this
organization that will always be lived up to. There never will be
a member of this organization, whether holding a local or
national position, or even a humble member, that will be eligible
to the Civic Federation. (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have not come here to make war upon individuals. We are not
here to make war upon organizations. But we have formed an
organization to make war upon the system that exists at the
present time. (Applause). We believe that through the past bitter
experience that labor has suffered, workingmen are ready for a
change, that they are ready to unite their forces in one
classconscious industrial organization; recognizing that the
powers that are against the producing class are organized as a
unit, and that it is absolutely necessary, in order to gain the
rights of the producing people, that they must be organized on
the same basic principle. (Applause). I have no fault to find
with the individual capitalist, no matter whether he is a small
capitalist or a large one. If he is a millionaire or a
multi-millionaire it is not his fault, but it is the fault of the
people because they foster a principle that permits him to become
a millionaire. (Applause.)</p>
<p>We believe the hour has come when the people are ready for
education on the lines that will unite their economic forces with
a solidarity that will mean something in this country. We believe
that those that have passed through labor organizations and are
in labor organizations at the present time have through their
bitter experience reached the realization that there is nothing
to be gained by division. (Applause). We hear people complain of
the capitalists. What is a capitalist? Nothing but a common human
being. He came into this world just the same as the common
workingman, just as helpless, and no matter what he possesses
while here on this earth, no matter what special privileges you
give him that permit him to reign over you, when the hour comes
that the Index Finger of the Universe points down to his heart
and says &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; the minute that command is made that
millionaire is on a level with the tramp. (Applause): He is where
he began. Can you blame him or can you blame the system? How many
of you that are here to-night that are not struggling to get on a
level with the millionaire? (Applause). How many of you would
miss the opportunity to make a deal in a speculative proposition,
or trust your little savings and take a chance? You will take a
chance every day on the games that the capitalists set up for you
to play, and the stickers go in and bite. And how willingly you
run in and bite because you think you are going to make an easy
dollar. But when on get through and you come to figure up your
earnings, it is the same as the white man does with the nigger
down south. When the end of the week comes he has had four or
five pounds of cornmeal and a sleep for himself, while the hag of
potatoes goes to the barn and the boss has figured all to the
white man and nothing to the nigger. (Applause). And that is your
position. And you are worse off in comparison to what you have
produced; there is nothing for those who have produced.</p>
<p>Now, that one individual whose name may appear over the
factory or place of business&mdash;tell you why it is that he can
be called a millionaire when thousands of men and women are
employed by him? How is one individual capable of sweeping out of
your production eighty-five per cent, of that which you produce?
Why does he do it? Is it from his power of muscle that you are
afraid of bum? No, you are not afraid of him. But the system
under which we live has educated you to the belief that it is
necessary to pay tribute to him in order that you may be
permitted to live. (Aplause.)</p>
<p>We believe the working people are waking up to these
propositions. We are not charging any organization with anything,
because there is not a man or woman on this platform but knows
that there has never been one step or progress ever taken by
labor except through organized labor. Unorganized labor never met
anything but contempt. Hence for every step of progress that has
been made credit must be given to organized labor. We do say,
however, had they been organized on a united basis, in a manner
where their power could be used if necessary at one time, that
their condition would be better. Now, comparisons have been made
between different people, and the brother who preceded me, I
think it was he, took a kink out of our brothers of the press
that were sitting around the table. Now, the other fellows are
slaves just the same as they are, (Applause). And I want to say
to you that they have more hardships than even the mechanic. If a
bricklayer lays so many bricks in a day, when night comes the
foreman or boss gives him credit for laying so much brick. Now,
one of these poor fellows will go out and cover a meeting and
work like a dog and get up a lovely report and lay it down before
the master, who will take a blue pencil and scratch two-thirds of
it out and throw it in the waste basket. (Laughter). Which goes
to show the position that they occupy and that their labor is not
appreciated by their master. Now, the reason why they put the
blue pencil through the work of the boys is this: It is simply
because they took the right to tell the truth, and the press of
this country doesn&rsquo;t want the truth. (Applause.) It is a
common occurrence, when you hear people misquoted to lay it to
the boys who take notes at the table, but I want to tell you that
with very few exceptions the man that reverses even the notes
that were taken and cuts out the sentences and spoils the whole
proposition is not the man who is here, but the man that sits at
the desk in the office and receives their work. He is the man
that does that. (Applause). So I would rather be a hod carrier
than one of those fellows. A hod carrier works only eight hours a
day. These fellows scab twenty-four hours often. (Applause). They
have to do it. They haven&rsquo;t got an organization. The hod
carriers are sensible enough to organize. They did that years
ago. (Applause). As a general proposition, when you see a young
man running around with a pencil over his ear and wearing a No.
To cuff for a collar you can&rsquo;t expect very much of him
anyway. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>But now, let us get down to practical work here for about
three minutes, and then I am going to let you go. This
organization, as stated to you, is broad enough for every
workingman. Provisions are made so that quarrels can be settled
among yourselves as to jurisdiction. There is no room for
jurisdictional quarrels in this organization. And we believe that
the working people are coming into it. We are going forward with
the work of this organization with no quarrels with any other
organization or any hatreds. We are going ahead with our work,
and if anything gets in our way we are going to push it out of
the way, for we are going on. (Applause). We need an organization
of this kind in Chicago, because if we had it the policemen would
have to walk their beats, and under the present system that is in
vogue here now they ride. (Laughter). I have often thought:
&ldquo;I wonder what poor Ireland would say if she could only se
her sons protecting a negro scab.&rdquo; (Laughter). And
sometimes we see negro policemen protecting white scabs. A
beautiful spectacle in America, when we can hire one-half of the
producing class to shoot down the other half. (Applause.) Is that
because of the solidarity of labor, or the division of labor? It
is because of the division of labor: It is because of the
aristocratic organization that we have been drilled in in the
past; the organizations that have told you as certain mechanics
that you are better than the other mechanics. I want to say to
you that there is no mechanic any better than the common laborer.
(Applause). If we had no common laborer the structures of any
city would not rise unless the mechanic went down and played
common laborer. (Applause.)</p>
<p>The common laborers are the founders of this country. They are
the ones that make it possible for civilization to exist. It was
the common laborer that took the ax and saw and went into the
forest, chopped down the timber and brought it to the mill. It
was not skilled labor, but it was common labor that put it on the
carriage and sent the saw screeching through it and made the
material that these buildings are made of. Common labor put it up
when it reached the place where it was going into our-mansions.
Then the aristocrat of labor got hold of it. Wait till I tell you
what they did. The &ldquo;aristocrats&rdquo; go to work and build
the beautiful structure. They carry it on till they get it
covered on all sides and on top. Then the glazier comes around
and sets the beautiful glass in the sash. The decorators come
inside and decorate and beautify it for somebody. And when it is
all in shipshape and ready to be occupied, labor has done every
bit of it. Common labor went into the forest and got every bit of
it. Labor went into the earth and got the stones and the material
for the foundation. Not one stroke was struck upon the building
by a man who may be called a capitalist. And then the last man
that does the setting of the hinges and the trimmings is the
locksmith. When be gets through and he has all the windows fixed
so that no one can get in, then he goes to the front door and
takes his chisel and hammer and sets the lock, and when he finds
that it works perfectly he goes on the outside of that building
that he with his brothers has built and finished and he turns
over the house key to a master that never struck a blow.
(Applause). There the master resides, but when you want to find
those whose blood stains are around that building you must go
into the districts where you find the hovel, the shanty and the
little cottage. There you find the men with brawny arms and red
flannel shirts on Sunday afternoon sitting around the house
smoking their little pipes and resting so that they may be good
and strong producers on the next day. Why have they none of these
things they produce? If these things are built by labor, why does
not labor own them? (Applause). Simply because they occupy the
same position as the trained brute. There is no one man could
hold a horse if the horse knew his own strength. No one man could
equal the power of the horse. When you see a spirited horse
driven by a lady, it is not because of her power over the horse,
but because he submits through fear. And that is the reason why
the producing class permit themselves to be driven. It is because
of fear. It is because they are afraid that their brothers will
not stand by their side when the pull comes. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Chicago in the past four months has been in a turmoil. We have
had a little experience here that I believe has opened the eyes
not only of the union men, but of the business men. I believe
business men are disgusted with the present form of organization.
I believe they in fact wish they could either get licked or lick
the other fellow quickly and have it over with. The present fight
that is going on in Chicago reminds me of a story. There was a
German who had a very nice little dog, and he made up his mind
that if he would clip its ears it would make a nicer looking dog.
But he thought that if he cut it off all at once it would pain
the dog too much, so he said: &ldquo;I just will cut a little off
each day so that it wont hurt o much each time.&rdquo; And that
is the way it looks about this strike; they don&rsquo;t want, it
to hurt so much each time. If labor was organized the way it
should be in Chicago, last January when the garment workers
struck, the teamsters connected with those factories would have
quit also. (Applause). And then organized labor would have served
notice on the governor and on the mayor of the city of Chicago
that the first time armed troops were seen on the streets of the
city of Chicago all labor would quit in the city of Chicago.
(Great applause). We will get you organized if you will be as
liberal with your support as you were when I first worked with
you. Because you need it in Chicago, and we don&rsquo;t need to
go to Fall River, where the brother came from, and where it was
reported by the American Federation of Labor that an excellent
settlement was made, but they never reported that they got a
twenty per cent, reduction the day after the settlement was made.
You don&rsquo;t need to go to Fall River to find sweat shops or
conditions that are not right for the working people. You can
find them right here in Chicago. (Applause). Right here in the
city of Chicago little children, little girls, are trudging every
morning to the factories when they should be around their
mother&rsquo;s skirts and going to school five days of the week.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>The main object of this organization, as stated by the
previous speaker, is to reach down and get the fellow that is
down and bring him up to the level of the fellow that is well
paid now. We are not looking at the top laborer, because we know
he sticks up in different places where there are
&ldquo;aristocratic&rdquo; hunches, and he goes down again like
that (illustrating with a gesture). We want to heave up these
hollow places, and level it all along on the bottom. We want a
minimum. (Applause). If we get the minimum up here, if the
mechanic is worthy of elevation, his work will show it and he
will elevate, and as soon as he does he will get right under the
common fellow and shove him right up to the side of him.</p>
<p>This is up to you. This is up to labor. If labor wants those
things it can ?et them by concentrated action. If we want to
remain unorganized or divided, why then the conditions will exist
just as they are at the present time. There never was a strike in
Chicago where there should be more credit given to men for making
a hard fight than the present fight that is in existence, the
teamsters&rsquo; strike. (Applause). I have been here twenty-five
years, and during that time I have seen a great many struggles. I
have never seen anything to equal the sacrifice that has been
made by the teamsters. The men have sacrificed and bled. I have
seen them go and face fifty policemen and put their wagons across
the street when they knew that it was impossible for them to
escape the policeman&rsquo;s club. I say that men who have the
courage to do that kind of work are fit for a revolutionary
movement. (Applause). The great trouble with the boys that are
out on strike is this: They are doing their part, but the trouble
is on the other end where they meet so-called union men-of
another organization that hasn&rsquo;t got a grievance yet, and
they wont have till the drivers are licked, and then the bosses
will skin these other fellows. On the other end we find union men
at the freight house doors welcoming the loads of scab freight.
They unload the freight and stow it away, and then they pass down
the line to the out-going freight, and there the union men load
up the scab wagons and make sure the loads are safely tied on
before they go away. (Applause.)</p>
<p>When labor is organized right, when the scab backs up he
b&rsquo; an organization that is based on a recognition of the
class t In society, on a recognition of the fact that there are
two on the exploiting and the other the exploited class, on a
,,cognition of the fact that there will be a class war until we,
the workers of the world, are determined to end that war, can we
succeed&mdash;and it is on this recognition that the workers have
organized the economic powers of the world. We must say, and
repeat again, that it is time in this country to organize the
workers on the same line as they are organized in all countries,
in all nations, in all parts of the world, with the same object
in view, with the same goal in view, that only by the use of our
economic power will we be able to wrest from those who own the
tools that which belongs to the producers of all the wealth.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>I do not deny that we have other weapons. I do not ignore the
political class struggle, or the class struggle on political
lines; yet at the same time I say that every Socialist or every
man who believes in Socialism has no apology to offer for the
formation of an economic organization of the working class that
is going to be the training school for the workers of the world
in order to enable them to operate the tools of production and
distribution in a co-operative commonwealth. (Applause.)</p>
<p>We see to-day in Russia how men lay down the tools for two or
three days, again resume operations for about a week, again lay
down the tools, and keep the employers all the time in a state of
irritation. We see to-day that the workers who are organized on
the right lines, on the principles of class solidarity, do not
care anything about the sacredness of contract. We see to-day
that workers simply go out in a body, in community, and in
recognition of the class solidarity and class community of their
fellow men&mdash;out on strike without recognition of the sacred
rights of those who exploit us. And we see to-day that there are
growing numbers of those that do not recognize the rights of
those who have exploited us for centuries. And why? Because of
the recognition of the class conflict that these organizations
have been organized upon; because every man who has become the
head of an organization realizes the fact that he must become the
pillar of the organization. Realizing the fact that he has the
interests of his fellow men at stake in the battle between the
capitalist class and the wage workers&rsquo; army, he becomes a
warrior in that army and always remains with it until the
victory. Such an army, whatever may come, whatever may be the
result, will always be an army of men that will always stick to
the colors, and will always remain a fighting army until the goal
has been reached.</p>
<p>There is a difference between pure and simple or craft
unionism and au industrial union organization. We simply proclaim
that a man should be a member of an organization of his shop
fellows, and when he knows why he is organized he never will
desert the organization. (Applause.) When he knows that a defeat
stares his shop fellow men in the face, he will know that the
proper time has come to go back to work. Although he may be
oppressed and ostracized and persecuted, yet he knows with his
fellow men in the same factory, in the same mine, in the same
shop, that the proper and opportune time will come when he,
without the consent of the employer, will take up arms against
him and fight against him. The difference between craft unionism
and industrial unionism lies in the fact that the craft unionist
recognizes the sacredness of contract. He allows the employer to
choose the battle ground, and when the contract expires the
employer is prepared to take up arms and take up the battle
against the employes. He has prepared everything to defeat them,
and when the contract is signed the employer does not recognize
the committee of the union. You all know, without the necessity
of proof, the conditions as they exist. The industrial unionist,
on the other hand, will consider and study the economic condi
flow of the country, and will always be prepared for a fight, and
will always be ready to take up the battle against the employing
class, always ready to take up arms, always ready to help his
fellow workmen in the same industry. Here is the difference
between a man bound down by the sacredness of contract and a man
who is bound to his fellow men in the same industry and in all
industries by class solidarity, by the recognition of the
solidarity of interest of all men who toil in the sweat of their
brow. And this recognition alone will make the industrial union
movement a success. The sacredness of contract idea should not
prevail in this organization. The workmen should always be ready
to take up the fight against the employing class; any time be
ready to support the men in the shop, in the same industry, in
all industries if necessary, to fight the battles against those
who exploit us, against those who grind out of our labor power
all the luxuries of their own life and do not allow us to enjoy
what nature has given to all mankind. (Applause.) Not the
difference in forms, but the difference in the means employed
should be the distinction between craft unionism and the
industrial union movement It should be the distinction between
the methods and the final aim and goal.</p>
<p>The industrial union movement recognizes the fact that labor
must always be exploited as long as the system of wage slavery
exists. The industrial unionist recognizes the fact that, unless
he overthrows the system of capitalist exploitation, he will
always be a wage slave. The industrialist will recognize the
fact, does recognize the fact, that with all the power at the
command of his fellow workers in the same shop, in all industries
in the world, he has only one aim one goals Quo object before his
eyes&mdash;the over. throw of the capitalist system. Although he
may fig1t the battles of to-day just as effectively, just as
fiercely, just as successfully as the old craft unionists have
fought them for the last ten years, the difference only is that
we see to-day the capitalist pitting one section of workers
against another section of workers. We see to-day how union men
can take the places of other union men. We see to-day the wood
workers taking the places of the carpenters; we see to-day the
engineers in one industry taking the places of the engineers in
another industry. We see how, by the abetting of the capitalist
class and through the aid of th.g labor leaders, one faction of
the working class is being used against the other part of the
working class, and by the systematic effort of the capitalist
class, the working class is kept divided and at loggerheads.
(Applause.) The industrial union movement proposes that there
should be solidarity upon the economic battle ground. The workers
should recognize that the common worker who sweeps the streets
and the man who earns $5, $6 or $8 a day in the iron and steel
works, are equal, one as good as the other; that they both have
one in terest; that they have one foe to fight, and that is the
owners of the tools of production and distribution. (Applause).
By recognizing this fact the industrial union movement proclaims
and the Industrial Workers of the World proclaim that we, the
working class, must use our efforts to get and keep the working
class united on the economic battle field in order to enable them
to control the means of life, the means of production and
distribution, so that the workers may be able to operate the
industries of this country, not for the benefit of the few, but
for the common good of all. That is the final aim of
industrialism. (Applause.)</p>
<p>The Chairwoman:&mdash;Before I introduce the last speaker I
will state that Eugene V. Debs is out of the city, and Daniel De
Leon was unable to come on account of sickness. The last speaker
will be Pat O&rsquo;Neil, the man from Arkansas.</p>
<h4>ADDRESS OF PAT O&rsquo;NEIL:</h4>
<p>Madam Chairwoman and Fellow Slaves :&mdash;I do not intend to
keep you here very long, because you have sat quite a while under
a fire of oratory and I expect you are tired; if you are not now
you will be mighty soon when I get going. We have beard every
speaker here this evening mention the class struggle, but no one
has yet defined what is the class struggle, so that if there is
any one here who has any wonder or any doubt&mdash;as to what the
class struggle means he may go away not knowing unless it is
explained.</p>
<p>Now, just imagine yourself as a workingman on friendly
terms</p>
<p>with your employer. He probably i a man of the very best
intentions but remember that, when his competitor cuts wages, he
in turn must cut yours or go out of business. That is the iron
law of competition and of business.. On the other hand, some
labor leaders in the United States undertake to convince us that
there is a harmony or identity of interest between labor and
capital. Now, you are interested in getting the largest possible
wages in return for your toil, while the employer is interested
in getting your labor for the least possible amount. Is there any
harmony or identity of interest in that? Can there be? Now, that
is the class struggle; the struggle of those who produce all and
have nothing, to have larger and larger returns for their labor.
The natural law of labor and of wages is laid down by all the
great authorities, beginning with the sacred writings, that
&ldquo;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread&rdquo;; not
in the sweat of an other man&rsquo;s face, but in the sweat of
thy face shalt thou eat bread; that is, that the result of labor
ought to belong to those who do the labor. That is the natural
law of labor and wages. Adam Smith repeats it as such. John
Stuart Mill copies this law, and so do all the great writers from
that early time up to the present. I will admit that we have some
men who write to the contrary, but they are not great writers.
(Applause). I want you to get that idea into your minds, as it
constitutes the class struggle.</p>
<p>It is very plain when you once come to see it, very plain.</p>
<p>Another thing. They were jollying the members of the press
here to-night, and I have just one thing to say about that. I am
satisfied that we have been organizing here on exactly correct
lines, exactly class-conscious lines, because there is
&rsquo;only one newspaper in the city that has told the truth
about what you did (applause), and tlt is the German newspaper,
which has given us a fair deal because it is a workingman&rsquo;s
paper. The other papers all belong to the employing class, and
they have lied like thieves. (Laughter and applause.)</p>
<p>Now, I just want to ask you a straight-forward question. I.
saw a sign down here the other day, &ldquo;Diamonds, jewelry,
etc.&rdquo; Now, just suppose that you were down there and your
wife came in and found you buying a diamond necklace and a watch
and chain and pendant with a nice motto, for some other woman,
don&rsquo;t you reckon there would be something doing at your
house pretty soon? Well, now, I want to tell you that that is
exactly what you do every day; you buy the diamonds and silks and
satins for the other feljow&rsquo;s wife, and the calico rags for
our own. (Applause). And by the gods, if that wife of yours had a
lick of sense she would go on strike and make you move your
washing till you got some sense. (Applause.)</p>
<p>As you were told a moment ago, I am from Arkansas. We raise
lots of things down in Arkansas; we aise some curious tuns, We
raise cotton, corn and mules-two-legged and four-legged
(laughter)&mdash;and we raise children and whiskey and hell.
(Laughter). A short time ago I was talking with a gentleman down
there, and he says to me: &ldquo;Why, you are crazy; you want to
pull mankind all down to your level.&rdquo; I says: &ldquo;No,
no, I can&rsquo;t understand it that way. I want to reach down
and get the fellow that is in the hole and bring him up a ways.
The trouble with your intellect is that it runs right down in the
mud like a hog&rsquo;s nose.&rdquo; And that is a fact. You take
a man whose intellect follows the line of his nose that is down
all the time, he imagines that the only way to level humanity is
by pulling down; but a man whose intellect looks upward towards
the light, he recognizes that there is only one way of leveling
mankind, and that is by leveling them up. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Some curious things occur in the labor field. I have lived
quite a while in this world, seventy-five years the second of
last month. I have been a laborer now a little over sixty-eight
years since I was bound up to a trade, and I want to call your
attention to some curious facts. You have been addressed to-night
by workingmen: Hagerty, of laboring stock; Haywood, an actual
laborer; Sherman and others. Now, Roosevelt is having some sort
of hysterics about race suicide. I will admit that his class runs
to cigarettes, collars and cuffs, but when you want men you go to
the laboring class and find them. (Applause). Take that man Bill
Haywood; the women who go to monkey dinners don&rsquo;t have that
kind of sons. (Applause). I don&rsquo;t wonder. I don&rsquo;t
wonder the men who associate only in the class to which Roosevelt
belongs fear race suicide. Luckily this climate is not good for
monkeys.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to talk statistics; that is dry
business; but I want to call your attention to one fact, that
your employers&rsquo; figures show that every workingman in the
United States produces wealth to the value of about $2,Soo per
annum on the average. We find that we have returned to us,
including salaries of the high-priced superintendents, presidents
of railroads and men of that class bunched in with the
laborers&mdash;that we get a return of about $437 per annum. Now,
then, I h&rdquo; got a question that I want to ask some of you
fellows that don t believe in this class business: Who in the Sam
Hill gets the other $2,100? What was it produced for? And by what
right does the individual who produces nothing at all relegate to
himself the greater portion of that which labor has produced?
Looking backward, s I said a while ago, we see that labor alone
can produce wealth, and that the smaller part called wages is all
that goes to those that toil. Then we find that the right to
property comes by labor and through labor. Talking with a right
nice Johnnie boy some time ago, whose father left him quite p
little wad of money in the way o railroad stocks and the Iikc of
that: &ldquo;How did all these things that you have, come to
belong to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my
father gave them to me.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Well, where did
your father get it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, my father made it in
business, sir, and accumulated it.&rdquo; &ldquo;He did? And that
is the way you come to inherit it, because he accumulated it?
Well, sir, I want to tell you something. My father did not
accumulate, but he produced, and I have been robbed of my
inheritance. The law of inheritance is all right, but it should
run through the line of production, not through the line of
accumulation.&rdquo; Of course, he couldn&rsquo;t see it that
way. I don&rsquo;t blame him, because he was at the wrong end of
the telescope, and I looked powerful small to him.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>But see here, do you believe there is any truth in that story
of the Carpenter of Nazareth? If you do, ask yourselves this
question: How many kinds of a fool was He when He spoke this
prayer that I want to give you: &ldquo;Our Father who art in
heaven, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.&rdquo; Now,
I want to ask you a question: If you believe He was here for that
purpose, and that He was a true representative of your cult, I
want to ask you who owns the corner lots and the oil wells in
Heaven? (Laughter and applause). While they have been talking and
praying about His will and His kingdom on earth as it is in
heaven, we have had nineteen centuries of Christianity and jails.
(Applause). I don&rsquo;t believe that kind of praying will do
anybody any good.</p>
<p>I am like Dean Swift and his man lock. One morning the Dean
said: &ldquo;Jock, did you black my boots?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;I blacked them yesterday, and
that is enough.&rdquo; After a bit, about dinner time, the Dean
said to him: &ldquo;Jock, I wish you would go and saddle my horse
and your pony,&rdquo; and while Jock was gone the Dean ate his
dinner, and when lock brought the animals around to the door the
Dean was ready to ride. &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said lock,
&ldquo;Master, I didn&rsquo;t have my dinner.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Dean, &ldquo;you ate yesterday, and
that will do for you to-day.&rdquo; Well, they started riding
down the road, and while Jock was riding ahead he met a friend,
who said: &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;We are going
to heaven,&rdquo; Jock replied. &ldquo;How do you make that
out?&rdquo; &ldquo;0h,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;I am fasting and
my master is praying, and if that is not the way to get to heaven
I don&rsquo;t know how you would get there.&rdquo; Well, it is
that way about Christianity and the jails. It is all either
prayer or fasting for the working class. (Applause.)</p>
<p>But as I said to you, I did not intend . &rsquo;eep you here
long. We have come here to hold a ratification o r the
organization of the first industrial movement in the United
States. For eighteen years I have been agitating on this one
particular line, asking my fellow laborers to get together in an
organization which recognized really, not just simply through
word of mouth, that an injury to one was an i1ury to all. 1liey
have at last got to the place where they recognize that.(
(Applause). And now, you who are here, I ask you to ratify it by
giving three good hearty cheers for industrial unionism.</p>
<p>The meeting then closed with three rousing cheers for the
Industrial Workers of the World.</p>
