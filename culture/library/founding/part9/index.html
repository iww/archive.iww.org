<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>SIXTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Monday, July 3</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>Chairman Haywood called the convention to order at 9.30 A. M.
The roll call of delegates was on motion dispensed with.</p>
<p>The Secretary read the minutes of the previous session, and
there being no corrections, they were approved as read.</p>
<h4>COMMUNICATIONS.</h4>
<p>The following communications were read by the Secretary and
ordered placed on file:</p>
<p>Hoboken, N. J., July 2.</p>
<p>Wm. E. Trautmann, Industrial Union Convention Hall, Clark and
Erie streets.</p>
<p>Chairman and Delegates:&mdash;Greetings. Our best wishes to
succeed in your important work. Smash the labor fakirs and
traitors. Twist the ropes to hang Gompers, Mitchell &amp; Co.
Three cheers for the new class-conscious movement. Yours for the
emancipation of our class.</p>
<p>HOBOKEN ORGANIZED LONGSHOREMEN</p>
<p>(in general meeting)</p>
<p>HENRY F. SCHRECK, Chairman pro tem.</p>
<p>FRED DITTER, Secretary pro tem.</p>
<p>Los Angeles, Cal., July 2.</p>
<p>Chairman Industrial Union Convention, Brand&rsquo;s Hall,
Clark and Erie streets, or 55 Clark.</p>
<p>May a class-conscious union crown your efforts and sound the
death knell of wage slavery. Adopted at public meeting of
Socialist Labor Party and Socialist Trade &amp; Labor Alliance,
Los Angeles, Cal.</p>
<p>H. J. SCHADE.</p>
<p>East St. Louis, Ill., July 7, 1905.</p>
<p>To the Industrial Union Conference, Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>Greeting:&mdash;A number of workingmen in this city has raised
a purse for the purpose of securing E. V. Debs to deliver an
address in this city. I was approached with the proposition and
told them doubtless E. V. was attending the Industrial Union
Convention now in session in Chicago and that if they secured him
he would doubtless talk industrialism unionism and oppose all
other forms of unionism. &ldquo;That will suit us,&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;we want him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;upon these grounds I&rsquo;ll volunteer to communicate
with the convention and learn how soon he can come.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good, do it &rdquo; they said. So now if E. V. can come
under the auspices of the Industrial Union so that the local S.
T. &amp; L. A. can take charge, we will get ready for a big
meeting under the auspices of the new organization. Hoping the
revolutionary spirit will guide the new organization into the
proper channel and launch an up to date revolutionary union, and
requesting E. V., or those who may have charge to inform me as
soon as possible the date that he can speak in East St. Louis, I
remain yours for the emancipation of the working class.</p>
<p>W. W. COX</p>
<p>522 North 43rd street, East St. Louis, Ill.</p>
<p>P. S.&mdash;They tell me expenses will be met. Let me know
what they will be.</p>
<p>Also a communication from a Schenectady union donating five
dollars.</p>
<h4>CREDENTIALS.</h4>
<p>DEL. WHITE, of the Credentials Committee, presented a report
from that committee recommending the seating of F. Kenke,
representing painters, tailors, machinists and a number of mixed
trades, with 47 votes; Timothy Mahoney, Street Laborers&rsquo;
Union, Chicago, with one vote. It was stated that the latter
brother represented an organization of 1700 members, who had
secured a nine-hour day with $2 a day, after Gompers had given
instructions to sign a contract for nine and a half hours with
less wages than the members were getting.</p>
<p>On motion, the report was concurred in and the delegates
seated.</p>
<p>Special committees were called for, but none had any report to
make.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Reports of standing committees. The Committee on
Constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY, secretary of the Committee on
Constitution: The Committee on Constitution has the following
Preamble to report.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: A point of information. Before that is done I
would like to suggest that the Constitution be read by
paragraphs, and that every paragraph should be read twice.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I will read it in chunks if you want it.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: And after that that the paragraphs be discussed
separately. I make that as a motion.</p>
<p>No second.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY (reading Preamble): &ldquo;The working class and
the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace
so long as hunger and want are found among millions of working
people, and the few who make up the employing class have all the
good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go
on until all the toilers come together on the political as well
as on the industrial field, and take and hold that which they
produce by their labor, through an economic organization of the
working class without affiliation with any political party.
(Applause). The rapid gathering of wealth and the centralization
of the management of industry into fewer and fewer hands make the
trades unions of to-day unable to cope with the ever-growing
power of the employing class, because the trades unions foster a
state of things which allows one set of workers to be pitted
against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby
helping to defeat one another in wage wars. The trades unions aid
the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that
the working class have interests in common with their employers.
These sad conditions can be changed and the interests of the
working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way
that its members in any one industry or in all industries if
necessary, shall cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in
any department thereof, thus making an injury to one the concern
of all. Therefore, we the workers unite under the following
constitution.&rdquo; (Applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of the Preamble
offered by your Committee on Constitution. What is the pleasure
of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. FRY: That Preamble may be all right. I am not prepared to
say it is not. From the reading of THE CHAIRMAN of the Committee
it is almost impossible for the delegates to digest the contents
of it. I believe it should be printed. I believe that each
delegate here should have a copy of it before we take any action
on it. Otherwise we may not be able to digest the matter as a
whole. I offer that as a suggestion or motion. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
each delegate be furnished with a copy of the Preamble before
taking action on the Preamble. Are you ready for the
question?</p>

<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I oppose that motion on the ground that
this Preamble is short enough for any one to catch the drift of
it, and that the printing of the Preamble and distributing copies
of it would delay this convention beyond a reasonable length of
time. If there are any objections to any of the principles laid
down, the Preamble is very brief, so that objections ought to be
stated plainly here and now to this convention, and the Preamble
itself ought not to be put off. If it were a lengthy document and
complicated and with much involving of sections and phrases it
might be reasonable to suggest the printing of that Preamble. But
to my thinking this convention is competent enough to take this
Preamble up as it stands. The workers here, I think, have
sufficient memory to retain the substance of that Preamble for
discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I want to offer a different motion, and that is
that the Preamble be accepted as the report of that committee and
without debate. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Without debate?</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Yes.</p>
<p>DELEGATES: No, no.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I have not heard a second to the motion.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: I second it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair will rule that motion out of
order.</p>
<p>You are speaking to the proposition of having this Preamble
printed.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: I am opposed to the motion, for the reason that
if it were printed it would not facilitate the work of this
convention. As one of the Committee has stated, it is brief
enough to enable the convention to take action upon it. I
therefore move as an amendment that the Preamble be taken up
paragraph by paragraph and acted upon. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: An amendment has been offered that the Preamble
be taken up paragraph by paragraph and acted upon. Are you ready
for the question? (Question called for). Those in favor of the
amendment will signify it by saying aye. Contrary, no.</p>
<p>The motion is carried. Read paragraph one.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty read the first paragraph, as follows:</p>
<p>The working class and the employing class have nothing in
common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are
found among millions of working people and the few who make up
the employing class have all the good things of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of paragraph one.</p>
<p>What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. M. P. HAGGERTY: I move its adoption. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. MCEACHREN: I would like to have some definite knowledge
as to what the good things of life are, and it seems to me that
the Preamble is objectionable in not specifying them.</p>
<p>A delegate raised a point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded that paragraph
one be adopted. Are you ready for the question? (Question called
for.)</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: If the
sending of delegates to this convention indicates anything, it
shows that there is a desire among the working class to free
itself from oppression, and the response to the call for this
convention shows that it expects that this convention will
express through its declaration of principles the situation as it
exists to-day as far as the capitalist class and the working
class are concerned, and that it will point out a policy by which
it may generate strength enough to free itself from wage slavery.
Now, fellow workmen, the Preamble offered by your committee
starts out, &ldquo;The working class and the employing class have
nothing in common.&rdquo; It appears to me that the paragraph as
it stands has no sense and is untrue. It does not say anything
about such matters as we should expect in the Preamble of this
new organization which has set itself the task of freeing the
working class. For this reason I move that we strike out that
clause and substitute the following: &ldquo;Labor is necessary to
satisfy the needs of society. Therefore every able person should
do some useful work for its maintenance. The means of production
and distribution have grown to such a size and have become so
costly that only a few can own them, as long as private ownership
thereof exists; condemning the rest of mankind to obtain an
existence by selling their labor power to those few. The private
ownership of the land and modern tools of production has turned
them into means of oppression and exploitation, forcing the wage
earning class to suffer want and misery and insecurity of
employment, while the increasing profit of the capitalist class
secures to them a life of idleness and luxury.&rdquo; I move that
this be substituted for the first paragraph of the Preamble as
submitted by the Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Just a moment. There is no second to the
substitute offered for paragraph one. The debate occurs on the
original motion, which is to adopt paragraph one as reported by
the Committee on Constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: There has
been objection offered against this paragraph which says that the
capitalist class and the working class have nothing in common.
Have we anything in common? I was once in a mining town and I
came to the post office. There were two little children playing
out of doors. They enjoyed their play very much. A man came out
from the post office and grabbed one child by the hand and said,
&ldquo;You have no business to play with this child.&rdquo; The
child commenced to cry, and said, &ldquo;Why, I love that
child.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that that child&rsquo;s father is a
miner and your father is a business man and also the
postmaster?&rdquo; Now, haven&rsquo;t those two classes something
in common? Isn&rsquo;t it frightful when the miners and the
workingmen down in the gutter live in those hovels and they have
got to pay rent for them? Haven&rsquo;t they got something in
common when the little children have to go to work in the cotton
mills in the eastern cities and work long hours watching the
looms and get $2.80 in two weeks, and the children of the rich
spend thousands of dollars in luxuries and for flowers, while the
workingmen who produce all wealth that these people enjoy have to
live in poverty and degradation? Isn&rsquo;t that a beautiful
communism? How do you like that kind of communism. I ask that
this motion shall be adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. GILBERT: I would like to say, Mr. Chairman and Fellow
Delegates, that it is quite impossible for us to split hairs and
to analyze with fine accuracy the scientific interpretation of
this or any other document. But one of the things that pleased me
particularly about that Preamble was this, that while possibly it
was not stated in absolutely scientific terms, it seems to me it
was stated in the terse, ordinary language of the plain people,
and that is what we want. We do not want to put out from this
convention an academic statement. We want simply to put out a
statement that will carry conviction to the mind of the humble
toiler, and when you talk about there being nothing in common
between them the average common horse sense knows that. Therefore
I would move you the adoption of that first clause, without
wasting the time of the convention. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: I have heard a good many Preambles read, and this
is the first time I have seen a Preamble that has not got the ear
marks of too many professors. The language sounds good to me. I
believe we can go before the working class of this country with
it and that they can understand the report without having to get
dictionaries and find out what is meant. What we want is to go
before the common people with a Preamble so plain that every
honest Tom, Dick and Harry, including ourselves, can understand
it. I am in favor of the entire Preamble as reported by the
Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I move the previous question. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair very much dislikes to entertain such a
motion. It occurs to me that this is a matter of the most vital
importance to this convention, and that if there are any
delegates on the floor that are opposed to the Preamble they
should have a right to express their opinions in regard to it.
However, the motion for the previous question has been made.
Those in favor will signify it by saying aye. Contrary by the
same sign, no. The motion is lost. The motion before the
convention at this time is to adopt paragraph one. Are you ready
for the question? (Question called for). Those in favor of
adopting paragraph one will say aye. Contrary, no. The ayes have
it. The motion is carried and paragraph one adopted.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty then read the second clause of the Preamble,
as follows: &ldquo;Between these two classes a struggle must go
on until all the toilers come together on the political as well
as on the industrial field, and take and hold that which they
produce by their labor, through an economic organization of the
working class without affiliation with any political
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A motion was made and seconded that the paragraph be adopted
as read.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
paragraph two be adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: It seems to me we are trying to adopt something
that is almost ridiculous in statement. If you will analyze that
as it stands, it says that we are in favor of political action
without any political party. I am absolutely in favor of no
endorsement whatever of any political party. At the same time the
wording of that is contradictory and confusing, and there ought
to be something done to straighten that out. It either ought to
be split into two sentences, or else it ought to state more
clearly what it does mean. As it stands now it practically says
no political action, without a political party. I object to that.
I have not a copy here, and so cannot make an intelligent
amendment.</p>
<p>A delegate moved as an amendment that the word
&ldquo;political&rdquo; be stricken out.</p>
<p>DEL. WRIGHT: I want to say that that paragraph does not
contradict itself, in my opinion. I will point out the reason.
The first part of the paragraph merely places it upon the plane
of the existing civilization, the existing conditions under which
we live in the United States; that is, wherever it is possible to
get at the mass of working people and present a program of the
International revolutionary proletariat by methods which give us
that chance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it says, &ldquo;without affiliation with any
political party,&rdquo; which is correct. We can pursue the
method of appearing before the working class with this program
without affiliation, and I believe that the sentence or paragraph
stands upon its feet, not that it comes out clear, but enough to
enable you to study it out, and I think that any person who will
follow that closely will see exactly the status of it.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: The paragraph reads, &ldquo;between these two
classes a struggle must go on.&rdquo; Why must it go on?</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: Until it is finished.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: &ldquo;Until the toilers come together on the
political as well as economic field and take and hold what they
produce.&rdquo; It says that the moment you bring the workers
together on the political and economic field the struggle ceases.
As a matter of fact, it just starts then. &ldquo;That which they
produce,&rdquo; why should they take it? Doesn&rsquo;t it belong
to them? If I have something I don&rsquo;t need to take it. To
take it implies that I take it from something outside of me, but
not from myself. This says, &ldquo;what they produce by their
labor, through an economic organization of the working class
without affiliation with any political party.&rdquo; Why should
that statement be in the Preamble, &ldquo;without affiliation
with any political party?&rdquo; The form of the organization
will give expression thereto. Although this phrase was in the
Manifesto calling this convention, I do not see any need to have
it in the Preamble. Mr. Chairman, I move that this paragraph be
stricken out and the following substituted: &ldquo;There can be
no peace as long as an increase of wages of the whole working
class means a corresponding decrease of profit to the capitalist
class, and vice versa. From these conditions a struggle arises
which will not cease until the worker is lifted out of his
present merchandise or wage slavery position through the
collective ownership of the tools of production and distribution.
Until such a change is possible the wage workers must unite and
organize as a class on the industrial as well as political field,
having for their aim an effort to realize their class interests
and to support and protect them in their struggle for
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. PARKES: I second the motion to adopt the substitute, to
get it before the house.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
paragraph two be stricken out and the substitute offered by
Delegate Richter be adopted instead. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: The paragraph, if you will let me read it over
again, says: &ldquo;Between these two classes a struggle must go
on until all the toilers come together on the political as well
as the industrial field and take and hold that which they produce
by their labor, through an economic organization of the working
class without affiliation with any political party.&rdquo; That
is the language as offered. I wish to speak for the clause as a
member of that committee, and against the proposed substitute.
The argument has been made by Delegate Simons that that is
contradictory; that this clause proposes political action without
a political party. Now, let me invite your attention to the
Manifesto, to the promise and invitation under which this
convention is gathered, and under the terms of which it is
convened. You will find on page four of this issue of this form
of the Manifesto (holding up a copy), this passage: &ldquo;Craft
divisions foster political ignorance among the workers, thus
DIVIDING THAT CLASS AT THE BALLOT BOX as well as in shop, mine
and factory&rdquo;; and on the next page of the Manifesto you
find this clause: &ldquo;It (this organization) should be
established as the economic organization of the working class
WITHOUT AFFILIATION WITH ANY POLITICAL. PARTY.&rdquo; If to
recognize the necessity of uniting the working people on the
political field, and in the same breath to say that the taking
and the holding of the things that the people produce can be done
without affiliation with any political party&mdash;if that is a
contradiction; if it can be said that these two clauses in this
proposed paragraph are contradictory, then the contradiction was
advocated by Delegate Simons himself, who was one of the signers
of this Manifesto. (Applause). Here you have his signature
(holding up the page of the Manifesto with Simon&rsquo;s
signature). But, delegates, there is no contradiction, none
whatever; and I consider that these two passages in the
Manifesto, if any one thing was to be picked out more prominent
than any other, are indeed significant of the stage of
development, genuine capitalistic development in America. This
Manifesto enumerates a series of evils that result from the
present craft division:&mdash;it shatters the ranks of the
workers and renders industrial and financial solidarity
impossible; union men scab it upon one another; jealousy is
created, and prohibitive initiation fees are adopted;
&ldquo;craft divisions foster political ignorance among the
working class, thus dividing them at the ballot box.&rdquo; If
this, the division of the working class on the political field,
is an evil, then it follows that unity of the working people on
the political field is a thing to be desired. And so it is; and
this clause in the Preamble correctly so states it. That being
so, does this other sentence sound contradictory, the sentence
that provides that the new organization shall be without
affiliation with any political party? The situation in America,
as presented by the thousand and one causes that go to create
present conditions, removes the seeming contradiction. That
situation establishes the fact that the &ldquo;taking and the
holding&rdquo; of the things that labor needs to be free can
never depend upon a political party. (Applause). If anything is
clear in the American situation it is this: That if any
individual is elected to office upon a revolutionary ballot, that
individual is a suspicious character. (Applause). Whoever is
returned elected to office on a program of labor emancipation;
whoever is allowed to be filtered through by the political
election inspectors of the capitalistic class;&mdash;that man is
a carefully selected tool, a traitor of the working people,
selected by the capitalist class. (Applause.)</p>
<p>It is out of the question that here in America&mdash;I am
speaking of America and not Europe&mdash;that here in America a
political party can accomplish that which this clause demands,
the &ldquo;taking and the holding.&rdquo; I know not a single
exception of any party candidate, ever elected upon a political
platform of the emancipation of the working class, who did not
sell them out as fast as elected. (Applause). Now, it may be
asked, &ldquo;that being so, why not abolish altogether the
political movement? Why, at all, unite the workers on the
political field?&rdquo; The aspiration to unite the workers upon
the political field is an aspiration in line and in step with
civilization. Civilized man, when he argues with an adversary,
does not start with clenching his fist and telling him,
&ldquo;smell this bunch of bones.&rdquo; He does not start by
telling him, &ldquo;feel my biceps.&rdquo; He begins with
arguing; physical force by arms is the last resort. That is the
method of the civilized man, and the method of civilized man is
the method of civilized organization. The barbarian begins with
physical force; the civilized man ends with that, when physical
force is necessary. (Applause). Civilized man will always here in
America give a chance to peace; he will, accordingly, proceed
along the lines that make peace possible. But civilized man,
unless he is a visionary, will know that unless there is Might
behind your Right, your Right is something to laugh at. And the
thing to do, consequently, is to gather behind that ballot,
behind that united political movement, the Might which is alone
able, when necessary, to &ldquo;take and hold.&rdquo; Without the
working people are united on the political field; without the
delusion has been removed from their minds that any of the issues
of the capitalist class can do for them anything permanently, or
even temporarily; without the working people have been removed
altogether from the mental thraldom of the capitalist class, from
its insidious influence, there is no possibility of your having
those conditions under which they can really organize themselves
economically in such a way as to &ldquo;take and hold.&rdquo; And
after those mental conditions are generally established, there
needs something more than the statement to &ldquo;take and
hold&rdquo;; something more than a political declaration,
something more than the permission of the capitalist political
inspectors to allow this or that candidate to filter through. You
then need the industrial organization of the working class, so
that, if the capitalist should be foolish enough in America to
defeat, to thwart the will of the workers expressed by the
ballot&mdash;I do not say &ldquo;the will of the workers, as
returned by the capitalist election inspectors,&rdquo; but the
will of the people as expressed at the ballot box&mdash;then
there will be a condition of things by which the working class
can absolutely cease production, and thereby starve out the
capitalist class, and render their present economic means and all
their preparations for war absolutely useless. (Applause). Then,
the clause &ldquo;between these two classes a struggle must go on
until all the toilers come together on the political as well as
industrial field, and TAKE AND HOLD that which they produce by
their labor&rdquo;&mdash;through what? THROUGH AN ECONOMIC
ORGANIZATION OF THE WORKING CLASS, &ldquo;without affiliation
with any political party,&rdquo; stands out in all the clearness
of its solid foundation and challenging soundness. That clause is
a condensation, I should say, of hundreds of volumes now in the
libraries of the country, and of many more volumes that have not
yet been written, but the facts upon which they are based are
coming forward. One of the facts, a fact of great importance is
that curious apparition&mdash;the visionary politician, the man
who imagines that by going to the ballot box, and taking a piece
of paper, and looking about to see if anybody is watching, and
throwing it in and then rubbing his hands and jollying himself
with the expectation that through that process, through some
mystic alchemy, the ballot will terminate capitalism, and the
Socialist Commonwealth will arise like a fairy out of the ballot
box. That is not only visionary; it is the product of that
cowardice which we find very generally in the politics of some
men who claim to represent the working class (applause), on
account of which we find that such politics in nine cases out of
ten degenerate into what is called &ldquo;possibilism.&rdquo; It
brings about a repetition of the methods of the Christian church,
which raises a fine, magnificent ideal in the remote future, to
be arrived at some time, sooner or later&mdash;rather later than
sooner&mdash;eventually if not later&mdash;and in the meantime
practices all &ldquo;possible,&rdquo; &ldquo;practical&rdquo;
wrong. (Applause). I maintain that this clause, consequently, is
not contradictory, but states the four-squared fact.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Your time is up.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I am done.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I desire to speak in favor of the clause as
read, not exactly for the reasons pointed out by the previous
speaker, but simply because it is in the field of possibilism and
practicability. (Applause). I cannot agree with the sentiments
just expressed, but with the clause just written. In looking over
the past and considering the great number of men, the men of many
ideas politically and otherwise, that have contemplated coming
into this organization, I think that this clause is just exactly
the thing, and it is born of exactly the same need that the old
line trade unions mean when they say &ldquo;no politics in the
union.&rdquo; It is born exactly of that same need. It is useless
for us here to attempt to disguise the fact that we have every
shade of political opinion. We have the Socialists&mdash;I happen
to be one of them&mdash;who believe that action in the political
line is absolutely necessary. We have the Socialist, on the other
hand, who is so near the anarchist that he is beginning to think
as the anarchist does, that action along the political line is
absolutely harmful instead of being useless. We have on the other
hand, members of different religious faiths, recognizing the fact
of the absolute necessity of the solidarity of the working class,
but who still cannot get away from their early teachings, their
early superstition, if you please, and cannot get into any
political party. Now, if we are going to be practical, if we are
going to work for possibilism, as it has been expressed, we had
better start out along the lines expressed in that section of the
Preamble, because only along such lines is it possible to
amalgamate the forces that we wish to amalgamate. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. MCEACHREN: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: I would
like to speak in favor of the clause as presented to this
convention. I would like to speak for the clause, not for the
language it is couched in, but for the ideas it represents. The
idea involved in this clause of this Preamble is this: That an
economic organization, founded upon class lines, will sooner or
later as an economic organization express itself politically. To
say at this time that you must endorse a political party which
does not exist, would be to anticipate something in the future. I
believe that this clause is thoroughly correct. I believe it is
correct for this reason also; you must recognize that the
strength of the working class is its economic organization; that
that economic organization is founded upon a common need. This
common need is expressed in the economic organization that
represents that common opinion. And I believe that the only
opposition that we will get will be from such gentlemen as have
spoken at the last, and who believe that the working class need
leaders other than workingmen to pilot them out from capitalism.
(Applause). I believe that is altogether incorrect. Therefore,
you must recognize that there must be an economic organization
founded on the class struggle. The scheming politician who comes
to you and says that he represents the workingman and that he
will turn tip the cudgels for you is and must of necessity be an
imposter and a prevaricator.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I confess frankly that I am unable to say
whether I agree with the ideas of the Committee on Constitution
or not, simply because the Preamble does not express clearly to
me any idea or any principle. It seems to me that this paragraph
of the Preamble particularly is intended, not to represent the
principles and purposes of industrialism, but represents a
toadyism to three different factions in this convention
(applause), and I am opposed to this organization toadying to any
man or any faction of men. Let this convention state the
principles of industrialism, and if the factions see fit to fall
in line and support then, well and good. It seems to me that this
paragraph could not have been more involved or more confusing if
it had been written by the platform committee of the Republican
or Democratic party. It seems to me as if the paragraph is
intended to be toadying to the man who does not believe in
politics at all, the pure and simple trade unionist as we have
come to call him; that it means a toadying to the Socialist, and
also to the anarchist, if you please. It seems to me that this
paragraph is intended to be such that the supporter of this
movement can point to it when talking to a pure and simple
unionist and say, &ldquo;that is just what you want, and
expresses what you believe in.&rdquo; I believe it is intended to
be such that a Socialist can be pointed to this platform with the
statement that &ldquo;this is Socialism.&rdquo; I believe it is
intended to be such that an anarchist can be confronted with this
platform and told that &ldquo;this means anarchy as it is written
right in this paragraph.&rdquo; I believe that is what this
paragraph is intended to be, and I am opposed to that sort of fad
myself. I may be wrong, Mr. Chairman. This paragraph may be
entirely clear to every other person in this convention, but I
confess it is not clear to me. I expect to do some talking for
this movement after this convention. I am going to talk to
individuals wherever I find them for this movement, and I cannot
afford to have Brother De Leon along with me every time I meet a
man, to explain what this paragraph means. (Applause). I move you
that this paragraph and the balance of this Preamble be referred
back to the Committee on Constitution for a clearer paragraph and
a Preamble that represents more clearly the principles and
purposes of industrialism. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I rise to second that motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegates who have spoken seem to think that
they are talking on paragraph two of your Constitutional
Committee&rsquo;s Preamble. That is not the fact. The delegate
here offered a substitute that is now before the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: Is this motion out of order then?</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: Is a motion to refer out of order?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, a motion to refer is in order, but you were
talking entirely to this paragraph, and the delegate now rises to
a question of privilege.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: No, I simply second this motion, and if that
motion comes before the house I would like to speak on it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is to refer this Preamble back to the
Committee on Constitution. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I just want to suggest two or three other things
that I am satisfied ought to be in there, if I understand it. In
the first place I see in this section what Brother Smith has just
said, that it seems that it is intended to catch everybody, and
that it does not catch anybody, and I want to say that it seems
to me there are certain things that ought to be embodied in that
Preamble. There are certain things that distinguish this
organization clearly and plainly from other organizations. There
is the one test in there, the principle of the class struggle.
The principle of the independent political action, I am not
insisting on. I would like to have it; that is my side of the
proposition. I am in favor of it, and I want to see it in there.
I also believe that this should be broad enough, and I think
Comrade Smith will also agree with me that it should be broad
enough to admit the anarchist and the Socialist and the men who
do not believe in political action at all in any way, providing
they stand by the other principle. The fact is that we all admit
the two principles which stand out clearly on the economic field;
first, that this organization is opposed to all bargaining across
the line between the capitalist and the laborer; and in the
second place, that the form of organization should be industrial
and not craft. Now, it seems to me that those points are not
brought out clearly in that Preamble, and those are the things
that ought to be clear above everything else. It may be my fault
that I cannot understand, but I do not see it.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I am talking here to the motion of Delegate
Smith. Delegate Smith&rsquo;s statement was that this paragraph
is a toadying to three distinct ideas; the pure and simple idea,
the Socialist political action idea, and the anarchist idea. Do I
understand you correctly?</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: Yes,?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: That was the substance. Now, he certainly is
mistaken when he says that there is any toadying here to the pure
and simple idea, because the pure and simpler states that
politics are exactly like religion, and that a man can go his own
way upon it. I do not know a single instance of a pure and
simpler who will say that the working people must be united on
the political field; so that so far as toadying to the pure and
simpler is concerned, I fail to see it. There remains what is
loosely called the Socialist political and the anarchist idea,
understanding by the latter the recognition of the mission of
physical force. Are they toadied to? If it is believed that there
is any toadying done towards either, it must proceed from the
opinion that any one of them has, exclusive of the other, the
whole truth; it must proceed from the idea that one or the other
is absolutely wrong. The truth is that they are both but a
fraction of the truth. I do not believe that when you state that
two bones belong to a body you are toadying to either bone. If
you scratch a political Socialist you will find a man who says
that the trade union is going to die out and there is no use
bothering about it. They don&rsquo;t want any economic
organization; they don&rsquo;t want any industrial organization;
hence they are mooncalves, ballot maniacs. On the other hand, if
you look at the anarchist, he, disgusted at the political
mooncalves, flies to the other extreme, and says:
&ldquo;political action is wholly useless,&rdquo; and you think
of physical force instantly and alone. The position of the
Committee was accordingly one, not of toadying towards either of
the two, but of recognizing the truth in both camps: the truth in
the Socialist political camp, that political action and the means
of civilization must be given an opportunity; and recognizing at
the same time the fact that in this country, for one, it is out
of the question to imagine that a political party can &ldquo;take
and hold.&rdquo; Consequently there are two distinct ideas that
run into each other, and the opinion of Delegate Smith upon the
subject proceeds from the notion that the two camps, anarchist,
so-called, and Socialist, are divided by an unbridgeable chasm;
otherwise there cannot be any toadying. For if there is something
that you hold is right, and something that I hold is right, and
we join the two and eliminate what is wrong in both, that surely
cannot be called &ldquo;toadying.&rdquo; This clause consequently
is a constructive clause with the feature of toadying absolutely
excluded. As far as the pure and simpler is concerned, he is
knocked on the head&mdash;do you call that toadying? I guess he
does not&mdash;because his attitude is that politics are simply
like religion and should be excluded absolutely.</p>
<p>DEL. GILBERT: I wish to speak to the motion to refer. I am
opposed to the motion to refer for the simple reason that there
is no constitutional question involved. If we will look at that
it is quite likely we will discover this. First, we are here to
effect an economic organization. There are two elements in this
convention. One element proposes to do away with political action
entirely. Another element is inclined toward political action.
All that this paragraph is in essence is this: It first of all
states very clearly and plainly that this is primarily an
economic organization based upon the conflict of classes.
Secondly, it says in essence this: That as individuals you are
perfectly free to take such political action as you may see fit.
As an organization you cannot. That is correct. (Applause).
Thirdly, in essence it says this: You shall not as an economic
organization stand committed to any political party at present in
existence. You may say, &ldquo;Why, then, shall we say that there
is any use in the ballot?&rdquo; This is why: Because, as Comrade
De Leon mentioned earlier in the discussion, the ballot is one of
the things generally agreed upon by civilized men to fight their
battles with. Consequently, if the economic organization is to be
the basis of any action&mdash;and it must&mdash;and if political
action must simply reflect the interest of an economic class, the
component parts of this industrial organization, the individuals
composing it, whenever they see fit to vote they will only vote
for that political party that reflects their economic interest.
(Applause). I do not care what name that political party has. You
cannot conjure with a name. If the Socialist party wants to
represent the economic interest of the working class it can only
do so by coming before us with such a program that it appeals to
our economic interest. (Applause). If it fails to do that, and if
the Socialist Labor Party does it, then the Socialist Labor Party
will have claims on the individual&rsquo;s fealty. And if that
fails to do it some political party will arise, because we should
remember this, Mr. Chairman and Comrades, that any political
party, I care not what it may be, it can only exist as the
manifestation of an economic interest, that is all. Consequently
this does not involve a constitutional question. We are simply
stating that primarily we are an economic organization based upon
the conflict of classes. Secondly, that as individuals we may use
every means, both political and economic; thirdly, that we do not
stand committed to any political organization in existence.
Therefore, I think it should stand as written. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: We must not
overlook the fact that we are here as workingmen, and as such we
do not recognize the Socialist, the anarchist or any other kind
of ist. We are here as workingmen and as rebels. (Applause). The
reason why we are here is that we want to devise ways and means
whereby we all can agree, and as the previous speaker stated
already, the economic condition of the workingman is the
foundation, is the fundamental condition of his being and his
welfare and his development. Now, then, this being the case, it
lays the foundation that economically we all are united and we
all have the desire to unite, for the simple fact that in the
past history of every one of us our division came from the work
of the capitalist and exploiting class. Now, then, we come here
to agree, and we all agree on the economics as the fundamental
question. We readily recognize the fact that there are men who
believe in political action, and they are entitled to; there are
others that believe straight-out in education and omitting to
take this political action. Both of those parties are right and
correct according to their standpoint. But the most important
fact is this, that all of us want exactly the same thing, and
there is no reason why these different factions should be on the
outs in any way. As I stated to start with, our economic
foundation is the one on which we are all agreed, and these two
ways, political action and non-political action, are only a
question of method, a question of judgment, of practicability or
whatever it is. But, as Comrade De Leon stated it very well,
there are many chances in every political party to give weight
and force and strength to the fakir. Now, what we want to do is
to eliminate the fakir, and, as I understand the statement of
Comrade De Leon, the Socialist party and the Socialist Labor
Party are looking after it to eliminate the fakir as much as
possible. Therefore, I appeal to all of you not to forget the
point on which we are united, the fundamental economic action. I
think the Manifesto in its clause is short and brief, but is
broad enough to embody all these different factions, and I am
heartily in favor of this clause as it stands.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Committee
on Constitution, I am opposed to referring this clause back to
this Committee, not only for the reasons so very plainly and
convincingly outlined by Delegates Gilbert, De Leon, Klemensic,
and others, but also for the reason that this Preamble is not
drawn up by the Press and Literature Committee, but by the
Constitution Committee. It is not designed as an exhaustive
treatise on these questions. Its function, as we understand it,
is simply a statement of bare facts and not the proof of those
facts, which is impossible in a Preamble. We are agreed on the
bread and butter question, all of us. We are agreed that we need
food, shelter and raiment. The economic, as Comrade Klemensic
just said, is the foundation in the last analysis, and it is not
the part of the Constitution Committee to engage in a long-winded
rhetorical flight in the Preamble to the Constitution. There are
plenty of opportunities, with this Preamble as a basis, for all
manner of orators and all kinds of politicians to burn up the
oxygen out of the atmosphere with long phrases and fine technical
hair-splitting. The fundamental fact is here stated and ought to
stand as it is stated, and ought not to be elaborated in this
Preamble. This is a part of the educational propaganda of the
proposed economic organization. To load down this Preamble with
all the suggestions that are turned in here, especially the
suggestions from one of the delegates, would mean the turning of
this Constitution into a folio of a hundred pages or more by the
time you got through. The Constitution should be a brief, pithy,
concise document, written in the language of workingmen, not
written in the language of Proudhon, not written in the language
of Bakunin or Marx or Engels, but written in the plain, everyday
language of the man in overalls. We want to appeal to the man in
overalls. (Applause). We want to organize the plain common
workingman, the workingman who could not, to save his immortal
soul, tell you the difference between variable capital and
constant capital, who could not distinguish the most technical
proposition in an academic statement. We want to talk to that man
in his own language. Therefore, I am opposed to referring this
thing back again. I also want personally to resent the
insinuation of Delegate Smith that this is toadying to anybody,
no matter who he is or what he is, or to any existing
institution, no matter what it may be. We are working here for
the working class. We do not care about any factions. We are
agreed only on the substance, upon the fact that we want to take
and hold all the things that belong to the working class, and we
want the goods, and we want to put the boots to the other fellow.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. LILIAN FORBERG: I want to oppose the amendment that was
offered by Comrade Smith, because it seems to me it is a waste of
time. It seems to me that this paragraph in the Preamble is just
as clear and plain on what we are going to do as language can be
made to express it. It says distinctly that this struggle,
meaning the struggle between capital and labor, must go on until
the forces are united on the political field. That means the
forces of capital on the one side united in a solid political
party, and the forces of the working people on the other side. It
distinctly says that this struggle must go on. It states in the
next paragraph that we come here to organize an economic
organization of the working class, based on the class struggle,
without any affiliation with any political party whatsoever. What
has been the trouble with the working class movement in all the
time that has gone before? Because there has been no economic
organization based on the class struggle. The old American
Federation of Labor is based on the idea of harmony, that the
interests of capital and labor are identical, and the old
political parties have been the expression of that idea, and have
been just as muddled as the expression of the American Federation
of Labor. If you organize here an economic organization based on
the class struggle, the workingmen that came into that
organization will understand that it is battling on the
workingman&rsquo;s side, and they will come to understand that no
political party can be put up by the capitalists to represent the
working class, and the time will come when no political party
which is the expression of the interests of the capitalists can
get the vote of a workingman belonging to an economic
organization of the working class based on the class struggle.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I shall not take up much of your time. What I
have to say I can say in very few words. It seems to me that we
workingmen who come here from all over this country, come here
for business. and not for any other purpose. We come here to
express in the constitution that we may adopt the sentiments that
caused this gathering to come together. It seems to me that the
proposition of Delegate Simons is strangely contradictory. He
stated that he agreed with the other delegate that this Committee
was trying to toady to some of the elements in this convention,
and then he goes on record as saying that he wishes this referred
back to the Committee to make it broad enough. Now, if I
understand the meaning of broadness correctly, in this case it
means just the very same thing that he condemns. This is broad
enough for me. I want to tell you as a member of the S. T. &amp;
L. A. and the Socialist Labor Party that I am not here to force
my ideas upon any one. Unless I can convince a man that I am
right I don&rsquo;t want him to affiliate with the Socialist
Labor Party. I believe that the Socialist Labor Party is right. I
believe the Socialist Labor Party is the only political
organization in existence that can emancipate the working class.
But that has nothing to do with the case. I am a member of the
Socialist Labor Party only in so far as I believe and am firm in
the conviction that it represents the interests of my class.
Otherwise, I do not care one whit for the Socialist Labor Party.
(Applause). I am opposed to political tight-rope walking. We are
not performing. We are wage slaves from the mills, mines and
factories. Now, let us adopt a common sense proposition upon
which we can proceed. I am anxious to be one of those who will go
out and try to get more of our fellow workingmen to affiliate
with this organization, but if you want me to do that I want a
proper basis on which to proceed. I want to have some kind of a
principle upon which to stand so that I need not be ashamed of my
affiliation with the Socialist Labor Party. I believe, Mr.
Chairman and Delegates, that this is sufficiently clear, and I
believe that there is no man in this movement who cannot go forth
satisfied that he is representing the interests of the working
class by adopting the original as it is. I am opposed to
referring it to the Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: I would like to ask, as a matter of
information, to have Comrade De Leon&rsquo;s amendment read. I
would like to know just where we are at before I go on.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I don&rsquo;t understand you.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: What is the status of the business?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion before the convention at this time is
to refer this Preamble back to the Committee on Constitution,
this paragraph two. Paragraph one has been adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. LA MONTE: This thing has been put into as plain English
as it is possible to get it. They have made a statement of the
class struggle, and upon that point it would only be a waste of
time to refer it back to the Committee and make the Committee do
the work over again that they have honestly spent their time upon
for two days. Why should this thing be repeated? I have been here
for days, and this convention has been wasting its time in
windjamming. You have got a statement here brought forth in as
plain and simple language as any man can produce, which simply
states the class struggle upon which we have got to stand. Why
should we waste time by referring this back to the Committee?</p>
<p>Question called for from various parts of the hall.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: It has been said that there has never been an
economic organization based on the class struggle. I want to say
that the Knights of Labor was an economic organization based on
the class struggle?</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: A point of order. The gentleman is not talking to
the question before the house.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: I am going to get to it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It is the motion to refer.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: The motion is to refer. Others have been
permitted to go into the merits of the main question. Why should
I be cut off at this time? Why should I be cut off now when I
want to show that the statement is not true?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Speak to the question before the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: To refer?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: To refer.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: That, of, course, then prevents me from going
into the merits of the question as I understand it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It prevents you from speaking on any other
question except the question to refer.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: A point of order. A motion to refer a
proposition opens up the main question to discussion, and is
entitled to the same treatment as if the motion to refer were not
made at all.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I believe you are correct, brother. I think you
have stated the proposition correctly. The delegate may
proceed.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: Now, I must return to the question of the
Knights of Labor, and why the Knights of Labor were destroyed. I
will make it brief. The Knights of Labor principles were set
forth in its Preamble; and let me tell you that the Preamble is
the most essential thing. I care not what your constitution
provides, it is the Preamble that must determine all our future
actions, and upon that hinges the various other things. The
Preamble of the Knights of Labor was, &ldquo;organization,
education, co-operation, political action.&rdquo; That in my
opinion is what this Preamble sets forth until it comes to the
one point in which it says &ldquo;no affiliation with any
political organization,&rdquo; the very thing that destroys the
essence of that Preamble. Prior to that it recognizes the class
struggle, it recognizes the necessity of political action, but at
the end it says, &ldquo;no political affiliation, no political
action.&rdquo; That is how it will be construed in our various
labor organizations, and the present Preamble will be no
advantage over the present declaration of the American Federation
of Labor. The question will be constantly raised in our
organizations, &ldquo;no political action, no political
talk;&rdquo; so there will be no political discussions on the
economic side, and no political economics would be permitted in
our labor organizations. We would simply be tying the movement
up, as it were. Now we should go on, and I believe that if a few
words were stricken out that we could agree to leave the question
open for the organizations to do as they saw fit. Why were the
Knights of Labor destroyed? They were permitted to go on and grow
like a snowball that was turning over and over, until it came to
a point where they wanted to take political action, and the
moment they did that there were those who prevented the success
of the movement. You who were living at that time in Chicago
understand that that was the position. That was why the Knights
of Labor was destroyed. We nominated a man in the United Labor
Party, Bob Nelson, a moulder. The district counsel appropriated a
certain sum of money for the purpose of carrying on that
campaign. Immediately there came Powderly. You all know who
Powderly was, I believe.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: A traitor.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: Powderly came with instruction that that money
should be put back into the treasury and no political action
would be permitted. It was a movement on the part of the
capitalists, and they used Powderly for the purpose of destroying
the Knights of Labor. They were destroyed because the assemblies
that were prevented from taking political action yielded up their
charters. And you know Powderly was taken care of just as Gompers
will be taken care of when he is out of the labor field. That was
the position in which we were. The capitalists do not believe in
forming a political organization. Why? They have got behind them
the President. They have got behind them the courts. They have
got behind them the guns that back up these things. Until we get
possession of the political field we will not be able to control
any of these avenues by which the government is used by the
capitalists that keep us in the condition of wage slaves. Is my
time up?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have three minutes yet.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: Now that is the position I take. Then we should
be careful that we take no action that will prevent in our
organizations the privilege of discussing at least economic
questions, and political questions in harmony with them. But I do
not believe that we should take the position of declaring for a
political party at the outstart, but this if adopted don&rsquo;t
say that or anything of that kind, and I believe it would be
disastrous and place us back just where we are to-day under the
present trade union regime.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: Mr. Chairman, have I a right to the floor?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: I have not spoken to the amendment, and I
don&rsquo;t want to cut off the gentleman in his argument.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I would like to ask, before I discuss this
question, the reading of that clause to be referred.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Will you read that clause?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: &ldquo;Between these two
classes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: The motion before the house is to refer the
entire Preamble back to the Committee on Constitution, is it
not?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, the motion before the house is to refer this
clause, as I understand it, clause one having already been
adopted by the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I do not think that is the sense of the motion
to refer. It would be absolutely silly and folly on the part of
the mover of the motion to refer a certain clause back without
referring the entire Preamble back.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: The motion was to refer this paragraph
and the balance of the Preamble?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Not the paragraph that has been already
adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: We cannot do that.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY (reading): `Between these two classes a struggle
must go on until all the toilers come together on the political
as well as on the economic field and take and hold that which
they produce by their labor, through an economic organization of
the working class without affiliation with any political
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Question called for from many parts of the hall.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I believe I was recognized before this
delegate.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This delegate (referring to Delegate Richter)
has the floor. You just rose to have the paragraph read.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I asked to have it read prior to discussing the
question.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This delegate has the floor, and he asked for it
before you came into the hall.</p>
<p>DEL. RICHTER: Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: It is not
that I rise to show what I know or do not know, but I may state
that I did not come into the labor movement yesterday; that
during the last ten years I have seen the ups and downs of the
labor movement, economic as well as political, and if anything
was responsible for the defeat that it suffered it was the lack
of recognition of their interests as a class. I defy any delegate
here to show me in the paragraph presented by the Committee,
anything that refers to the class struggle in any other manner
than by stating the words &ldquo;class struggle&rdquo; and that
it must go on. Now, what does this say? Does that give us a
conception of the class struggle? It does not. If this
declaration or Preamble shall be of any use, it must be the means
whereby the speaker in the meetings or wherever it be shall have
a chance to go back to its declaration of principles, so as to
shut out any element injurious to the movement, and to incite an
effort to gain an understanding of it. With the wording of this
paragraph as it is, as it has been pointed out by some of the
speakers, you leave the door open to any one. Just listen:
&ldquo;Through an economic organization of the working
class.&rdquo; Now, a store keeper along the avenue here is a
worker; a small farmer is a worker; and so you go along the line.
On what ground can you prevent them from joining this
organization? If the class struggle has any sense at all it means
the struggle built upon the class interests of the wage working
class; and therefore it springs from the fact that an increase in
the wages of the whole working class means a corresponding
decrease of the profits of the capitalist class. From this
condition springs the class struggle, not from an organization of
the working class. But I am opposed to referring it back to the
Committee, as the Committee has, through two of its
representatives, expressed itself and shown that it has no desire
to change or alter the Preamble in such a manner as to give a
different expression to those essentials, those factors which
constitute or are active in this struggle. When we say
&ldquo;class struggle,&rdquo; you hear the word and you may think
anything of it if you are not informed and are so blind that you
desire such plain language, yet the result of this blindness
means more confusion to us and more strength to the enemies of
the working class. I am a delegate from one of the Locals of the
S. T. &amp; L. A., and I was certainly forcibly reminded of the
words of Delegate Debs on last Thursday, that &ldquo;the theory
of the S. T, &amp; L. A. is correct, but there is something wrong
with its method.&rdquo; And certainly the speakers that have
stood upon the floor here have shown by their very position that
the charge was well founded. Now, fellow workers, if this
organization shall amount to anything, you must bring to every
man as far as possible a recognition of their class interests. If
you cannot do this you may amalgamate all the workers, but you
will not be in a position to generate the strength to bring forth
the energy essential to overcome the capitalist class. Delegate
De Leon said that we must have the workers&rsquo; economic power;
that Right is a shadow without Might. But I ask you, what Might
can an economic organization generate? It can only pit its empty
stomachs against the full cupboard of the capitalist class, but
it can make those empty stomachs strong when they are accompanied
by an intelligence and by a knowledge of the factors of the class
struggle which will mean their destruction. It makes those empty
stomachs strong when they are accompanied by a knowledge of the
factors in this class struggle which work toward the uplifting of
the working class. And that is the only part which the wage
working class has through its organization to accomplish its
mission. Now, Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, after listening
to the expression of the sentiments of this convention I do not
expect that it will adopt the substitute. I therefore do not hold
that the wage working class will not progress. What this
convention may leave undone some other convention will do. But I
feel it my duty not to be guided by a reverence for some high and
grand mind, whether it belongs to this organization or any other
organization, or to decline to act because to express a certain
condition certain words must be employed which are unfamiliar to
many men, but which you must employ if you want to bring home to
man a knowledge of what is for the interest of his class; and for
this reason I have spoken.</p>
<p>DEL. BERNINE: Mr. Chairman and Delegates to the Convention: It
was necessary that there should be a long course of academics and
debate in the preliminary and earlier work leading up to the
labor movement. It was necessary at one time that we should
distinctly state that, when we spoke of the working class, that
we should refer to it as the wage earning class in order that
people might know what we meant. But at this time we are all in
accord as to what is meant by the working class, and I think that
there can be no splitting of hairs here. It was a long time
before we could impress upon that working class a recognition of
the fact that there was a class struggle, but the coming together
of this convention shows us that that class struggle has been
recognized. It shows us that the necessity for academic
discussion has gone by, and that we can confidently approach the
working class at this time with a plain statement of terms,
without any scientific trimmings. I think we are all sufficiently
aware by this time that the working class must be united
politically. I think we are sufficiently aware that they must be
united upon their material class interests, and as I said we can
come in this simple language to the working class and ask them to
organize upon the proposition that there is a struggle in society
between the classes, which will not end until the working class
is united economically and politically to take and hold that
which they have produced. (Applause). The time for certain action
has come. And what is that action? Simply to cut that string
which binds the working class to the capitalist class. That is
the action that we have to take here at this time. It is to set
the working class free from the capitalist class by striking off
the fetters that weight them down to the capitalist class, and by
uniting them, first economically, on the class struggle. And as I
say, the academic discussion has gone forward to that point where
we know definitely that all class struggle is a political
struggle, or in other words, a struggle for the public powers, in
order that we might through these public powers, by the might of
our economic unity, take and hold that which we produce.
Therefore, I think this is sufficiently clear. I recognize the
fact that we are here for action and not for economic discussion,
and I am not in favor of that motion to refer.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: I am in favor of referring back to the
Committee for this reason: I think the working class has been
sufficiently hypnotized in regard to what true working class
politics are. The prevailing opinion exists among the workingmen
that going up to a capitalist ballot box and dropping a piece of
paper in it means working class politics. I want to tell you that
that is the most contemptible lie that was ever told you, for
this reason: To imagine that you could go into a capitalist hall
of Congress and by a vote take possession of their property.
Isn&rsquo;t that a piece of rank nonsense? You might just as well
go over to the Board of Directors&rsquo; room of the North
Western Railway Company and cast a vote to take possession of
their property. Do you think they would hand it over to you? No.
They will never do anything like that. So get that microbe out of
your head. What we are up against you all know pretty well. There
are certain reasons why we can&rsquo;t tell the truth right
here.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: No, sir, none.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: But the fact that stares us in the face is that
we have a struggle ahead of us, and this struggle is going to be
a bitter one, and the clearer we can get, the nearer to the earth
we can get, the better it will be for your carcasses. Now, what
are true working class politics? Is it that you are voting at a
capitalist ballot box? No. True working class politics means
this: That in so far as the working class is organized to take
possession and enforce their demands on the economic field,
working class politics grows co-extensively with this economic
power, and all the voting that you fellows have to do is among
yourselves as to what plan of action you will take against this
capitalist class, and time will reveal to you fellows the rank
nonsense of voting at a capitalist ballot box. You can vote
better probably with machine guns and hand grenades in the course
of time.</p>
<p>(Manifestations of disapproval in various parts of the
hail.)</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: I am in favor of referring that resolution back
to the Committee in order that they can strike out all of that
confusing language about political action at the capitalist
ballot box and all that stuff, and bring back in place of that
clause a plain statement of what the working class is going to do
on the economic field. I thank you.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKES: We do not know a thing unless we know the reason
for the thing. The discussion that has gone forth as a result of
these motions has cleared up this question in my mind, and I
think it has cleared it up in the minds of a number of others.
The function of a constitution is not to teach the class
struggle. The constitution constitutes the frame-work of the
organization, and in the making of that constitution we are
guided by the principles of working class economics and the class
struggle; and it seems to me that the Committee have done well in
their statement of the proposition, although I was the one who
seconded the motion to adopt the substitute because I did not
know the reasoning upon which they based their deductions which
they made. To give you an analogy, it is not necessary for an
architect to teach mathematics in order to erect a structure. In
order to apply the principles of the class struggle and build up
an economic organization upon the lines of the class struggle, it
is not necessary that the principles of the class struggle shall
be taught by every clause of the constitution or by any of the
clauses. It may be built in accordance with those lines.
Nevertheless now it has been stated upon this floor that this is
not the only organization that has been built on the lines of the
class struggle. I am not speaking of the S. T. &amp; L. A. I only
wish to speak of the things which I know. It has been said that
the Knights of Labor was built upon the lines of the class
struggle. I will read from the declaration of principles of the
Knights of Labor adopted in 1874, and you may judge for
yourselves: &ldquo;It is not a political party. It is more, for
it is a crystallization of sentiments and measures for the
benefit of the whole people.&rdquo; The benefit of the whole
people is the declaration of the Knights of Labor, and not the
benefit of the working class as is stated in here by the report
of the committee on the Preamble to the constitution. And it goes
on to say: &ldquo;But it should be apparent, when exercising the
right of suffrage, that most of the objects herein set forth can
only be obtained through legislation, and that it is the duty of
members, regardless of party, to assist in nominating and
supporting by their votes such candidates as will support these
measures. No one, however, shall be compelled to vote with the
majority.&rdquo; Those are quotations from the declaration of
principles of the Knights of Labor adopted in 1874. So I think
that a great deal of this discussion that has been brought
forward here is founded upon wrong premises. Nevertheless, I
think it has resulted in clearing up a great deal of doubt in the
minds of many. Having read the substitute over a number of times,
I have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to refer
this paragraph back to the Committee, but that it ought to be
adopted as reported by the Committee on Constitution.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Mr. Chairman and Delegates to this Convention:</p>
<p>You all know that if I could have done it I would have saved
two thirds of the discussion on the Preamble when it was read to
this convention. Now, as a delegate to this convention and as a
union man and a Railroad Brotherhood man for forty years, I want
to say something at this time. That second declaration in the
Preamble follows the first, and the first is that there is no
harmony between the two classes. The majority of the Constitution
Committee who prepared the Preamble is made up of men like
myself. You have heard and I have heard men who have represented
so-called labor organizations, stand before audiences and say to
those audiences of workingmen, &ldquo;Your interests and the
capitalists&rsquo; interests are identical.&rdquo; I am here to
say that the first clause in that Preamble contains a statement
that they stand diametrically opposite, and the man who,
proposing to represent labor, would stand before an audience and
make the declaration that their interests are identical, is
either a knave or a fool. It is this condition of things and a
knowledge of this condition amongst men who have, for years and
years, contended as best we could for our rights, that has
brought this convention together. I am going to speak for the
adoption now of that second resolution to prevent this Preamble
being referred, if I possibly can, back to the Committee. Why?
Because when I first heard it read by the Secretary I recognized
the fact that it covered the ground wherein the others had
failed, and that it gives to every man who will read it the very
thing that you want him to have, and that is that he can readily
see that this economic organization is based upon the fact of the
class struggle, and that his interests and the interests of his
masters are not the same. It says that this struggle must go on
and on. Until what? Until labor has been organized to see its
solidarity, until the working class can claim its own. Some of
you people have talked about politics. One actually talked about
shooting. Let me tell you something. It requires a great deal
more courage on the part of some men to vote than it does to
shoot. You fellows who talk that way, put that in your hat. I
have been there. I was a rebel in 1864-5, whether it was any
credit to me or not. I have been familiar with events from the
Baltimore riots in 1877 until the thrashing of the street railway
employes in New Orleans two years ago, and I am pretty well
acquainted with every contest that has taken place. In 1881 I was
upon the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; system when the engineers had their long
contest, when it cost some of us a six or eight dollar a day job.
If every man who labors and produces wealth had been joined in a
labor organization so that every man could have had every other
man&rsquo;s assistance, there is not a time or place in history
if they would stand together in solid phalanx but what they could
get what they want without either shooting or fighting. You ought
to recognize that fact. Supposing the men of this country stand
together who produce the wealth. I want it understood that I am
not arguing for the other side; I am arguing only for the man who
works in a useful occupation and produces something necessary for
the use of society. I have no use for the parasites of society at
all. This second declaration in this Preamble says that this
struggle must go on and on because the encroachments of the
parasites upon the producer of wealth rob him of what he produces
and prevent him and those who are dependent upon him from having
not only the good things of life, but even the necessaries of
life in many instances. A comrade asked what we meant by the good
things of life. I hate to make this reference, but I hope there
is no man in this audience who is a delegate that is non compos
mentis, not sound in mind. The good things of life referred to
there&mdash;and I am satisfied that the Committee will bear me
out in it&mdash;mean that the toilers of the land may have good
houses, good clothes and good food, and that their children shall
have the chance of a good education. I want to say that I
don&rsquo;t want to see a vote cast by a delegate to refer that
back, but I hope it will be adopted unanimously.</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: Mr. Chairman, I don&rsquo;t want to take up the
time of this convention in any useless discussion on this
question. We have already spent two hours of our time here and
have accomplished nothing. We have come from all over the
country, from all over this broad land with one purpose in view,
and that was to organize the working people of this land into one
solid compact body. But it seems from the two hours&rsquo;
discussion here that this convention has been called for two
purposes; one, with the understanding that it is to organize the
laboring class, I believe, and the other that it is to organize a
political party. We are taking up too much of our time discussing
this word &ldquo;politics.&rdquo; We should leave that out
altogether, leave that to one side. We don&rsquo;t care to
discuss politics or to refer in the convention to political
organizations. We come here for the purpose of organizing
ourselves into a compact body so that we can go out and meet the
foe. We recognize, the fact that there are but two classes in
this land, one the capitalist class and the other the laboring
class, and that the capitalist class is already bound and
organized into solid bodies on the battlefield while we are
scattered in the trade unions. The working class have discovered
this fact, and they have sent us to represent them and not the
political bodies. We are here representing the laborers of this
great land. We were sent here for only one purpose, and that was
to organize this industrial laborers&rsquo; organization. Let us
do that; let us accomplish that. We have had a committee out for
the last two days working. They have been working day and night.
They have presented to us a set of resolutions or a Preamble for
the basis of our organization which is perfect in every way, and
I believe that we are taking up unnecessary time in discussing
that here by injecting too much politics in it. To refer this
back to the Committee would take two more days of time. They
would then present it to this convention, and we would consume
three or four more days with the Preamble, and do nothing except
increase expense to ourselves and to those whom we represent and
who sent us here. Therefore, I move you the previous question.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. JACKSON: When the delegate behind me spoke in favor of
referring this paragraph back to the Committee he stated that
certain facts made it impossible to tell the truth in this
convention. Now, I disagree with him. I claim that the truth has
been told in this paragraph in such a brief form that if any
article were left out it would be a half truth, and that would be
no truth at all. Now the first phrase is, &ldquo;The toilers must
come together on the political field as well as the industrial
field.&rdquo; That is a truth, a solid fact. The eleventh
commandment of Gompers, who states that &ldquo;Thou shalt have no
politics in the union,&rdquo; is proven to be a lie, because just
as soon as a union man gets up to discuss working class economics
and not political action, then he is shut off. That proves that
the discussion of economics from the working class standpoint in
trades unions must inevitably bring out a discussion of the
political action of the working class. (Applause). Now, it has
been said and argued that that last clause providing for
nonaffiliation with any political parties conflicts with that
position. It does not. The first clause simply shows the
workingman intending to affiliate with this industrial union that
he must be prepared to discuss working class economics in that
union, and inevitably must follow political discussion. But that
does not entail the official affiliation or endorsement of any
political party. I am satisfied that if this industrial union
throws open its doors to the discussion of the economics of the
working class, then it must entail the discussion of the
political action of the working class, and therefore the
endorsement of any specific political party is absolutely
unnecessary.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is that paragraph two of the Preamble
be referred back to the Committee. Those in favor of the motion
will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. Motion lost. The
motion now occurs on the substitute introduced by Delegate
Richter. Are. you ready for the substitute? (Question called
for). Those in favor of adopting the substitute will say aye.
Contrary, no. The substitute is lost. The original motion is to
adopt paragraph two. Are you ready, for the question? (Question
called for). Those in favor will signify it by saying aye.
Contrary, no. The motion is carried. The paragraph is adopted,
and the Secretary will read. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY, of the Committee, reading: &ldquo;Third
paragraph. The rapid gathering of wealth and the centering of the
management of industries into fewer and fewer hands make the
trade unions of to-day unable to cope with the ever-growing power
of the employing class, because the trades unions foster a state
of things which allows one set of workers to be pitted against
another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping to
defeat one another in wage wars. The trades unions aid the
employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the
working class have interests in common with their
employers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL, O&rsquo;NEIL: I move the adoption of that paragraph.</p>
<p>(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has, been regularly moved and seconded that
paragraph three be adopted as read. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for). Those in favor will signify it
by saying aye. Contrary, no. The motion is carried and the
paragraph is adopted. (Applause). The Secretary will read.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Fourth paragraph: &ldquo;These sad
conditions can be changed and the interests of the working class
upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its
members is any one industry, or in all industries, if necessary,
cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department
thereof, thus making an injury to one the concern of all.&rdquo;
(Applause.)</p>
<p>The paragraph was read a second time owing to the fact, to
which Delegate De Leon called the attention of the Secretary of
the Committee, that the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; after
&ldquo;upheld&rdquo; had been inadvertently omitted on the first
reading.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: I move the adoption of this paragraph.</p>
<p>(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
paragraph four be adopted as read. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I just want to ask the committee to allow an
amendment. I want the last part of the paragraph to read:
&ldquo;an injury to one is an injury to all,&rdquo; not
&ldquo;the concern of all.&rdquo; I want to make it the injury of
all. I ask the Committee to accept that as an amendment; if not I
will put it to the house to amend it in that way.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATSKE: I suggest the same thing.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I ask that the delegate put that as an
amendment, because we of the Committee have no power to change
it.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Just read the last few words.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: &ldquo;Thus making an injury to one the
concern of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I move to amend by making it read, &ldquo;thus
making an injury to one the injury of all.&rdquo; (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Has the Committee any objection to making the
change?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I have, as a member of the Committee, an
objection to making that change.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: It can only be done by the house as a whole.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you offer that as an amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded that the clause
be amended by making it read, &ldquo;the injury of all&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;the concern of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I object to that, because an injury to one is
not exactly an injury to all, but is the concern of all. An
injury to a man in California is not a direct injury to a man in
Chicago. It is the concern of the man in Chicago. It is the
concern of his class, but it is not a direct injury. It is the
concern of all workingmen, the business of the entire working
class to resent that direct injury, but in actual fact an injury
done to one workingman is not felt by the entire working class at
all. A wage worker here in Chicago may be discharged for his
activity in unionism. The injury is confined to that one wage
worker, but his injury is the concern of all wage workers, the
concern of every other member of the working class, but it is not
a direct injury to every worker. Moreover, this particular phrase
&ldquo;an injury to one is the concern of all,&rdquo; is familiar
to all workingmen, and it seems to me in view of these facts that
it ought to stand the way it is.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I thought we had been talking about the class
struggle continually in this convention. I want to say that we
really have made up our minds on the class struggle. Seeing that
we have done that, it appears peculiarly clear to me that the
injury of one of that class is the injury of every one of that
class. (Applause). We can twist it as we please as long as we are
in this class struggle the injury of one is the injury of every
one of that class.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I would like to ask Delegate Hagerty, Delegate
Hagerty as a physician, if an injury to any part of the body is
not an injury to the whole body, as a medical question?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Not necessarily, not as a medical
question, is an injury to one part an injury to the entire body.
It depends on whether it is functional or organic. If there is an
organic injury, of the heart, for instance, the entire body is
injured. But you can have a nerve injured without injuring the
entire body. You can have a nerve injured without interfering at
all with your digestion. Your digestion will go on just as well
afterward, and all the different processes will go on just as
well as before.</p>
<p>DEL. SAMUELS: Comrade Chairman and DELEGATES: We want to make
this question so as to be understood not only by the progressive
delegate and progressive workingman, but by all workingmen. All I
want to tell you is this: There are very few people who
understand that an injury to one is an injury to all, and
therefore we have got to make it plain so that every workingman
will understand it.</p>
<p>DEL. JACKSON: Delegate Hagerty says that an injury to an
individual is not a direct injury to any but the one. I think
not. If a man is injured, if a member of the working class is
injured, we know that every individual in that class is liable to
that injury, and I believe that if we take the standpoint of the
concern of all we will take that standpoint as a sympathetic
strike, and it cannot be put in that position. Every industry or
every craft must strike from the standpoint of its material
interests as a craft. I am in favor of changing that word to
&ldquo;injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I do not agree with Delegate Hagerty, and I
will give you my reasons for it. I heartily agree with the
proposition to amend. An injury to an individual unit of this
great body of workingmen in San Francisco would be the concern of
all of the individuals because though the concern of an
individual must be addressed directly to the individual, yet if
it is an injury which affects the whole class directly or
remotely it causes an injury to each individual unit of the
organization. Therefore I stand for the amendment to change the
wording of that from the concern of all to the injury of all.</p>
<p>DEL. BOSKY: I disagree with Comrade Hagerty. I believe that
whatever hurts any individual laboring man hurts at the same time
the whole class of laboring men. That is an economic law.
Economic laws are such that any benefit that the capitalist class
derive immediately out of an individual is an injury that
concerns all of us. The science of economics must be taught; the
equality of labor, the value of labor and of commodities, must be
taught before you can make any success of a movement of this
kind. It is no use talking about parliamentary rules in an
organization of this kind. Economic laws are involved in an
economic movement, and they must be the foundation of the
Constitution and everything else.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I move the previous question. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question occurs on the amendment, which is
to insert the word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; in place of
&ldquo;concern.&rdquo; Those in favor of the amendment will
signify it by saying aye. Contrary, no. The amendment is carried.
The question now occurs on the original motion to adopt paragraph
four as amended. Are you ready for the question? (Question called
for). Those in favor of the motion will signify it by saying aye.
Contrary, no. The paragraph is adopted as amended. A motion would
be in order to adopt the Preamble in its entirety.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move that it be adopted as a whole.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the Preamble be adopted in its entirety.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: As amended?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, the whole Preamble. Those in favor of
adopting this Preamble as amended will signify it by saying aye.
Contrary, no. The Preamble is adopted as amended. (Great
applause.)</p>
<p>PREAMBLE.</p>
<p>The working class and the employing class have nothing in
common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are
found among millions of working people and the few, who make up
the employing class, have all the good things of life.</p>
<p>Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the
toilers come together on the political, as well as on the
industrial field, and take and hold that which they produce by
their labor, through an economic organization of the working
class without affiliation with any political party.</p>
<p>The rapid gathering of wealth and the centering of the
management of industries into fewer and fewer hands make the
trades union unable to cope with the ever-growing power of the
employing class, because the trades unions foster a state of
things which allows one set of workers to be pitted against
another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping
defeat one another in wage wars. The trades unions aid the
employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the
working class have interests in common with their employers.</p>
<p>These sad conditions can be changed and the interests of the
working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way
that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries,
if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in
any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to
all. Therefore, we, the working class, unite under the following
constitution.</p>
<h4>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h4>
<p>A number of announcements were made as to meetings of various
committees.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 17</h4>
<p>Del. Coates, of the Resolution Committee, reported back
Resolution No. 17, offered by Delegate Chas. Kiehn, of Hoboken,
in regard to the struggle of the people in Russia with a
recommendation on the part of the Committee on Resolutions that
the resolution be passed.</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded to concur in the report of the
committee. The motion was carried and the resolution adopted.</p>
<p>No further committees were ready to report, and at twelve
o&rsquo;clock the convention adjourned until one
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
