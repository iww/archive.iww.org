<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>FOURTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Friday, June 30</h3>
<h3>MORNING SESSION</h3>
<p>The convention was called to order shortly after nine
o&rsquo;clock by Chairman Haywood.</p>
<p>The roll of members was called by Secretary Trautmann.</p>
<p>Minutes of the previous day&rsquo;s meeting were read by the
Secretary, and there being no corrections, were declared
approved.</p>
<p>A communication from Manager Greenebaum, of the Indiana
Transportation Company, was read and placed on file.</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann: Here is a resolution, handed in by a club
that was organized as an Industrial Union Workers&rsquo; Club,
with the names attached to the resolution to be handed in. It is
too lengthy to be read now. I have given it to the Resolutions
Committee.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: Excuse me for breaking into your business to make
a statement as to the Committee on Constitution. The committee
met last night and organized, and decided that if they were to do
their work as a Constitution Committee they could not attend this
convention during the day. They feel that it is going to take
some time to prepare the constitution and by-laws to govern this
movement if launched, and while they would like and I believe
they should take part in the deliberations of this body during
its sessions they feel that it would be impossible for them to do
that and forward the work that has been allotted to them. I would
like to have the sense of this body as to whether or not they are
going to continue in session while the committee that has been
appointed is doing its work. Whatever the action of the
convention may be, the Constitution Committee will be compelled
to retire and take up the work to which they have been
appointed.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I would suggest that the Constitution
Committee make some suggestions to this body as to what is
required.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I think that the work of the committees is
sufficiently important and takes enough of the delegates away
from the convention that we can well afford to adjourn during the
time that they are working. Therefore, I move you that as soon as
the communications now before the convention are finished we
adjourn until Saturday at one o&rsquo;clock to hear the reports
of the different committees. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that as
soon as the communications that are before the convention have
been read the convention stand adjourned until one o&rsquo;clock
Saturday to hear the reports of the different committees.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I would like to ask Brother Hall whether he
would not accept an amendment making it Saturday at nine
o&rsquo;clock and then when the convention meets if the
committees are not ready or substantially ready to report and
finish their work, that we can adjourn till one. It is possible
that having the whole day virtually to work in, they will be
through with their work. But if the amendment is not accepted I
shall not push it.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: If that is the sense of the Chairman of the
Constitution Committee, that they can finish their work and make
a report by Saturday at nine o&rsquo;clock, I will accept the
amendment&mdash;accept the suggestion.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I am not prepared to say what time it is going to
take the Constitution Committee to submit a report to this
convention. That will have to be determined after the committee
have completed their work. If we can have it ready at nine
o&rsquo;clock tomorrow we will submit the report at that time. If
not, we will continue at work until we have it completed.</p>
<p>DEL. SIMONS: I think there will be some of the committees
ready to report by nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning, at least
something, while we will have to get along without some one of
the committees at some sessions. Therefore it seems to me that at
nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning we will be ready to do
business undoubtedly on some things. Some committees will no
doubt be able to do the same at every session all along. We can
attend to some business with some sixty members out, and
therefore I support the amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Will the mover of the motion accept the
suggestion of Delegate De Leon to adjourn until nine instead of
one?</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion stands that we adjourn until nine
o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning after the reading of the
communications that are on the table. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>DEL. KERRIGAN: Why not adjourn and let the committees report
to the convention at half-past five o&rsquo;clock? It may be the
committees will be ready to report at that time. Then we may be
able to do business during the day. At all events, adjourning
till to-morrow morning I think is a rather long time, because the
Constitution Committee should have that Preamble adopted anyhow
by five o&rsquo;clock to-night. As to the details of the
arrangement of industries, about the scavengers and diamond
cutters and machinists and others and how they will be arranged
in the circle as set out in the program, that is not a matter of
very great importance, though it might appear so to some workman
to know whether he was to be classified with the trolley drivers
one day and with the machinists another day, and so on. I think
that all that the Manifesto calls for could probably be covered
generally for the present, and the details can be covered at a
future session. I think it would take much longer than a day to
do that.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question is that the convention stand
adjourned until to-morrow morning at nine o&rsquo;clock after the
communications are read.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I do not approve adjourning the convention till
nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning because the important
committees have absolutely nothing in their hands to work upon. I
am a member of the Resolutions Committee, and not a solitary
resolution has been presented to that committee. Consequently if
you adjourn till nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow we will have
nothing to do. I want to see that these delegates around here get
busy. I would like to make an amendment that we adjourn till one
o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: An amendment has been offered that we adjourn
till one o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. The delegate will please
confine his remarks to the question.</p>
<p>DEL. BARTLETT: A point of information. I have heard a call for
the getting together of the Resolutions Committee and the
Organization Committee, but they did not say anything about a
Label and Emblem Committee. I would like to know whether they are
to get together immediately after adjournment.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I would like to make a motion that we go on till
we have gone through with the order of business. If we have any
more business let us go through with it, and then if we have no
further business let us adjourn. I think that in about fifteen
minutes we can go through with the regular order of business. I
move that the matter of adjournment be deferred until that time.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I am opposed to the motion made by Brother
Coates to defer, for the reason that the members of those various
committees are probably in session and want to attend the
sessions of this convention. There certainly can be no business
before the convention until the committees report, and if any is
ready they might transact their business. But it seems to me that
the work of this convention must necessarily be delayed until a
constitution is adopted, and I believe that the Committee on
Constitution is entitled to the consideration of this convention
of having this convention adjourn until within a reasonable time
at least, to formulate a report. It is impossible for them to do
so during the sessions and be present at the sessions, and I
believe that the majority of them at least desire to attend, and
they should have the privilege if they want to. Therefore I am in
favor of the motion to adjourn until nine o&rsquo;clock
to-morrow.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You are taking up an awful lot of time to vote
on this proposition. The question is called for. The motion
before the convention at this time is to defer action on the
motion to adjourn until such time as the routine business has
been disposed of. Those in favor of the motion will signify it by
saying aye. Contrary no. Louder, please. Those in favor of the
motion will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The ayes have
it; the motion is carried. The Secretary will please read the
communications.</p>
<p>The Secretary: I haven&rsquo;t any more.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: There are no further communications. Report of
Credentials Committee. Has the Credentials Committee any report
to make?</p>
<p>DEL. ROWE: I just wish to ask for a point of information. I
would like for the chair, if he possibly can, to announce to the
delegates how many members of trades unions the delegates here
assembled represent, so that we will be enabled to report to our
constituents on that point. It has been said that the various
delegations here represent about 150,000 members. I would like to
know if we can get that information.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: That is not possible at this time.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I would request that the Secretary compile as
soon as possible the information asked for by the delegate and be
prepared to give it at the next session.</p>
<h4>CREDENTIAL</h4>
<p>Secretary White, of the Credentials Committee, presented a
verbal report from that committee, recommending the seating of
Mr. Downey, of Lead, South Dakota, as a delegate with one
vote.</p>
<p>On motion of Delegate De Leon, duly seconded, the report was
concurred in and the delegate seated.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Have the special committees any report to
make?</p>
<p>No reports were offered.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Reports of standing committees. For the
Committee on Literature I desire to report progress. Has any of
the other standing committees any report to make?</p>

<p>DEL. COATES: I want to report for the Resolutions Committee
the fact that up to this time there have been only six members
out of the twenty attending the sessions of the committee. We
don&rsquo;t want that kind of attendance at the next meeting. If
we have it we are going to ask this convention to change the
personnel of the committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The members of the Resolutions Committee will
take notice, and when the chairman of that committee announces a
place of meeting let every member of the committee attend that
meeting.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I was simply going to make that announcement.
Now, while I have the floor here, I will say that the Resolutions
Committee will meet at that table immediately after this
morning&rsquo;s adjournment, whatever time that is, and I want
everybody there.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I would ask, I being a member of the Resolutions
Committee, that all resolutions be handed in before the closing
of each session. Be ready here in the convention and hand them in
and they will be referred to the Resolutions Committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Are there any other reports of standing
committees ?</p>
<p>DEL. MCKINNON: I wish to report that the Ways and Means
Committee have not been able to get a quorum. If the committee
don&rsquo;t have a quorum we will have to change the committee,
as two or three of us can&rsquo;t possibly meet when there are
twenty members of the committee. We will meet on the stage
immediately after adjournment.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: The members of the Constitution Committee will
meet immediately after adjournment in the adjoining hall.</p>
<p>DEL. REMLEY: The Organization Committee has nothing to report.
We met on the stage last night, and there were only two or three
of us. I would like to know who the members are and why we cannot
get together. We can meet on the stage and select some place of
meeting after adjournment.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: It seems to me that there are a large number of
individuals who are on committees that don&rsquo;t know it. I
have listened very attentively to the reading of committees by
the Secretary to find out if possible who those representing
themselves only in the convention were that were on the different
committees, and from the reading of the Secretary I was unable to
learn that. I believe that there are a large number in the same
fix.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Are there any further reports of standing
committees?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I was just going to suggest, under that head,
that it is pretty near time to appoint the Label and Emblem
Committee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I have got it right here.</p>
<p>DEL. KING: Let the resolutions be read and submitted to the
convention.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: They will be read and referred to the
Resolutions Committee. And at this time the chair would like to
say that if any delegate has a resolution to offer it will be
accepted at this time. The Committee on Literature and Press will
meet in the rear end of the hall immediately after adjournment.
If there are any groups that made their selection for member of
the Committee on Label and Emblem they will please hand it to the
chair.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTIONS</h4>
<p>The Secretary then read the following resolutions:</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 1</h4>
<p>To Provide for the Establishment and Maintenance of an
Educational Bureau.</p>
<p>Whereas, The general apathy and indifference to their true
interests on the part of the great body of the workers, an apathy
and indifference created by the industrial conditions and
maintained by the ignorance&mdash;fostering methods of the
capitalist editors, writers, speakers, and supporters generally,
present in many respects the most serious problem of industrial
unionism; and</p>
<p>Whereas, This problem can be solved only by the most
determined, persistent and systematic efforts at education on the
part of this union; therefore be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That we hereby provide for the establishment of an
Educational Bureau to consist of two divisions, as follows:
First, a literature bureau to disseminate the knowledge and
teachings of the class struggle found in the writings and
speeches of such exponents thereof as Marx, Engels, Bebel,
Lafargue and others of the same school in Europe and America,
together with other works on science, history and economics,
having direct or indirect bearing upon working class interests.
Second, a lecture bureau to keep in the field of the American
labor movement a constant supply of speakers and lecturers
working in conjunction with the literature bureau. That said
speakers and lecturers be chosen with a view to their fitness to
teach the history and economics of the class struggle; that they
be examined as to their fitness by a competent board of
examiners; that each lecturer receive a stipulated salary from
the bureau, said salary to be as low as possible so as to keep
out unprincipled adventurers with no practical experience in the
labor movement; that the locals provide entertainment for said
speakers and lecturers while in their respective localities. Be
it further</p>
<p>Resolved, That for the use and maintenance of said literature
and lecture bureau this organization shall set apart fifty per,
cent of its regular receipts for dues, and that the officers of
the bureau shall furnish every six months to the local and
general organizations full and complete reports of the money
expended and the work done. And be it further</p>
<p>Resolved, That the substance of this resolution, together with
any changes or additional provisions that may be necessary to
carry it into effect, be embodied in the constitution of this
organization.</p>
<p>(Resolution submitted by M. P. Haggerty, of the Butte Mill and
Smeltermen&rsquo;s Union, No. 74, of the Western Federation of
Miners.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution will be referred to the
Constitution Committee.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION NO. 2</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>Resolved, That it be the sense of this convention that a
public ratification meeting be held not later than July 7th in
this city; and</p>
<p>Resolved, That a committee be appointed to make suitable
arrangements for the same.</p>
<p>(Thos. J. Hagerty.)</p>
<p>The Chairman: The resolution will be referred to the Committee
on Ways and Means.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION NO. 3</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Murtaugh.)</p>
<p>Resolved, That it be the sense of this convention that the
labor of each individual unit of society is necessary to the
welfare of society, and that all are entitled to equal
compensation.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution will be referred to the Committee
on Constitution.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION NO. 4</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the first of May is the international
holiday of the proletariat, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That we, as industrial unionists, manifest our
solidarity with the class conscious wage workers of the world by
setting apart the first day of May as the holiday of the American
proletariat.</p>
<p>(A. Klemensic.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution just read will be referred to the
Committee on Resolutions.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION NO. 5</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>Whereas, Experiences of the past in various working class
organizations have proved it to be dangerous to put much power
into the hands of man by making him the head of an organization ;
therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That we, of the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club of
Cincinnati, Ohio, oppose the plan of having a president as
outlined in the diagram plan of organization, and favor an
executive board, in turn to be controlled by representative
committees of all industries in proportion to their dues-paying
members as the convention may decide.</p>
<p>(Endorsed by the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club of Cincinnati,
Ohio, as instructions to Delegate Max Eisenberg.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be referred to the Committee on
Constitution.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 6</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>Resolved, That the seceding workers and seceding organizations
in the A. F. of L. be required to make a public statement of the
reasons of their secession, and furthermore that the rank and
file in seceding organizations be thoroughly informed by a course
of lectures or otherwise of our Manifesto and plan of
organization before they be eligible to membership in the
industrial union movement.</p>
<p>(Endorsed by the Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club of Cincinnati,
Ohio, as instructions to Max Eisenberg.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That properly should be referred to the
Committee on Good and Welfare. Not having such a committee, it
will be referred to the Committee on Resolutions.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 7</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>To the Officers and Delegates to the Industrial Labor
Convention</p>
<p>Whereas, By a call, issued from Chicago, January 2, 3, and 4,
1905, and known as the Manifesto for the purpose of uniting all
the producers of wealth into one industrial labor organization in
order to better enable the wage earners to wrest from the
self-appointed guardians of the producing masses a just and
appropriate share of the wealth which they create; and believing
that the time has now arrived in the history of the trades unions
when a radical change is necessary in their construction to
successfully combat and meet the changed conditions and combined
corporate control of the industries and business methods and the
centralizing of all force where necessary. Lucrative positions or
offices in present trades unions should be a secondary
consideration. Self-consciousness should be eliminated from our
desires. We must lay aside all personal ambition and see only the
great benefit to be derived by the army of toilers and the
advantage accruing to them. Our whole energies must at this time
be used in an honest endeavor to bring together into one compact
body the wage earners of all classes, trades and callings,
regardless of their color or creed, and then we will be carrying
out the oft-demonstrated fact that separately and singly we can
be beaten, but collectively and combined into one and all
sheltered by the same cover of a universal labor organization we
are invincible. Believing that this can be accomplished and the
intent and purpose of the Manifesto be observed and every part of
it adhered to by adopting a plan of organizing the workers along
trade lines giving absolute home rule to each of them, thereby
eliminating the expensive and impotent system now in vogue,
simplifying and making it possible for a more systematic
organization to be organized, eliminating the wars and factions
now so much in evidence, bringing the workers into closer
relationship with the working machinery of their own organization
and locally organizing the workers industrially and centralizing
their power by cities, concentrating all into one compact body
internationally.</p>
<p>(Alex. Fairgrieve.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The resolution will be referred to the Committee
on Organization.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 8</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>Whereas, The universality of the class struggle between the
wage working class and the capitalist class being a recognized
and accepted fact by this industrial union convention; and</p>
<p>Whereas, There is an identity of interests between the wage
workers and a common antagonism of interest existing among the
workers as against said capitalistic class; be it</p>
<p>Resolved, By this convention, that we recommend as a final
solution of the class struggle the social general strike as the
most effective warfare for plutocratic capitalism and to
inaugurate a universal democracy for the workers.</p>
<p>(Max Barthold, Industrial Workers&rsquo; Club of Chicago.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be referred to the Committee on
Resolutions.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 9</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this convention to endorse
and provide a perfect system of commercial co-operation.</p>
<p>(W. F. Morrison, Houston, Tex.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This will be referred to the Committee on Ways
and Means.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. l0</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>Resolution offered by Delegate E. Bosky.</p>
<p>Whereas, The knowledge of economic laws is not apparent in
this convention; and</p>
<p>Whereas, The construction of a new constitution for a new
economic movement depends upon the quality of the construction
material used for the purpose;</p>
<p>Resolved, That this convention decide upon a time when a
discussion of this subject is to take place.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be referred to the Committee on
Resolutions.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 11</h4>
<p>(Read by Delegate Hall.)</p>
<p>Whereas, The maintenance and development of an independent and
efficient labor press being essential to the militant working
class movement, the effort to extend and improve the organization
of the workers must comprehend and include the direct welfare of
the labor press; and</p>
<p>Whereas, It is obvious that the present relation of the labor
press to the working class is inadequate in that it does not
fully nor satisfactorily reflect the activity, interests and aims
of the workers ; and</p>
<p>Whereas, We recognize that this condition can only be remedied
by an unhampered liberty of speech, a sound and effectual
propagation of economic science, a universal system of
independent newsgathering, and a democratic spirit preserved and
expressed both in the various labor journals and in the union of
the entire labor press by an Associated Labor Press; therefore,
be it</p>
<p>Resolved, That the Press and Literature Committee be
instructed to urge the democratic union of the labor press to the
end that its relations to the workers will become true and its
power for education and for battle greater by a practical effort
to that end.</p>
<p>(Joseph J. O&rsquo;Brien.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be, referred to the Committee on
Literature and Press.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 12</h4>
<p>Resolved, That the name of this union be the Industrial Union.
The Chairman: That will be referred to the Committee on
Constitution.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 13</h4>
<p>Resolved, That it be the sense of this convention that only
those who are wage workers be eligible to membership in this
organization.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be referred to the Committee on
Constitution.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 14</h4>
<p>Resolved, That this new industrial organization be instituted
on July 4th as Independence Day for the wage workers.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be referred to the Committee on
Resolutions.</p>
<h4>RESOLUTION No. 15</h4>
<p>First&mdash;I suggest that the name of this organization shall
be the International Toilers&rsquo; Union.</p>
<p>Second&mdash;This organization shall not condemn any
individual for his occupation. His occupation may be unuseful for
society, but he is not to blame. But it must condemn the system
which produces such individual.</p>
<p>Third&mdash;Any individual who performs any duty for this
society, and also the individual occupations that can be used in
a future society, a door shall be open to them.</p>
<p>Fourth&mdash;That it must also provide that every individual
could come in; that is, no big initiation fees or high dues.</p>
<p>Fifth&mdash;I would suggest that we should establish a central
organization, and we shall only charge twenty-five cents
initiation fee, and twenty-five cents a year dues. This shall
make the individual a member only of the central organization,
but he shall also be a member of the local organization which
will be a part of this great central organization, and the local
initiation fees and dues shall be so low that it shall be in the
reach of every workingman.</p>
<p>Sixth&mdash;It shall have an international manager or
secretary and a national secretary or manager, and its officers,
secretaries, organizers or editors shall be paid the same wages
as they could make from their own occupations.</p>
<p>Seventh&mdash;The organization shall establish a publication,
and it shall be supported by the international dues-paying
members. The 25 cents a year that every members will pay will
probably pay the expenses of the international, national. and
state officers. If any individual does not want to belong to a
local union which is a part of the central organization he may be
a member of this body by only paying in 25 cents initiation fee
and 25 cents a year, but the locals shall make it so convenient
for members and be reasonable and shall have power to take in the
individual in a local union.</p>
<p>Eighth&mdash;The meetings shall be public; No secrets, because
secrets manufacture spies.</p>
<p>Ninth&mdash;This organization must be organized on the class
struggle, and the working man shall be taught higher wages only
shall not be his aim, but to get the full product of his labor,
and so educate him to establish universal peace. At the same time
the working man shall not take orders in the shape of a soldier
to shoot down his own fellow workingmen.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>J. S. SCHATZKE.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That will be referred to the Committee on
Constitution. Are there any further resolutions?</p>
<p>No further resolutions were offered.</p>
<h4>LABEL AND EMBLEM COMMITTEE</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The members of the Label and Emblem Committee
are: W. F. Cronin, A. L. U.; T. B. Jackson, S. T. &amp; L. A.; J.
A. Ayers, Paper Hangers; A. H. Williamson, U. B. R. E.; Thomas De
Young, U. R. R. S. The chair selects Albert S. Cogswell, Chas.
Nickolaus and Chas. Kiehn. Is there any further business to come
before the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. C. O. SHERMAN: We are now organized and prepared co go
ahead and do business. I believe it would be perfectly proper for
this convention to have a motion prevail that no more credentials
will be received of delegates to sit in this convention. My
purpose in saying so is that from the appearance of the
credentials that have been coming in they have been dragging
along. I claim that there is no excuse now for any one not being
here. If it is acceptable I will make a motion to that effect.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair will entertain the motion, inasmuch as
it is to be decided by the convention. The motion is that no
further credentials be accepted and no other delegates be seated.
You have heard the motion. Are you ready for the question?
(Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN, CHICAGO: Mr. Chairman, this convention has
assembled, and there are in this city organizations that desire
to know something of what is being done here, whose members when
they know the situation will want to come in and carry on the
great fight that we have begun. During this week many of these
labor organizations in Chicago will have their meetings. Before
Monday night all will have had their meetings. The news of this
organization will spread out to those organizations that have no
representation here. The Carpenters and a few other local
organizations only have representatives here. During the week
they will all have meetings, and they are liable to send
delegates here next Monday. Between now and Monday we will have a
chance to report back to our constituents, and I will guarantee
that the report that I will give of this body will be favorable.
(Applause.) If I am able to convince every man in that body
(carpenters) that carries this working card and this due book, I
will do so. I only wish that I had the ability to explain what is
going on in this convention to my union, as some of those men
that have spoken on the floor can do. I think I would have
accomplished a good deal. But being a foreigner, not born in this
country, I must say that in the twenty-five years that I have
been here I have not been able to pick up the language so as to
handle it perfectly, although I may have the will. Now, I am not
going to drift away from the question that is before the house. I
think that we ought to extend the seating of delegates to Monday
night on this ground that I have stated. Let us have all that we
can at this convention. Let us say like the Salvation Army says,
&ldquo;It pays to hold a big meeting if you can save only one
soul.&rdquo; It pays to extend the time for seating delegates
until Monday night. As long as we are receiving any delegates I
cannot see why the door should be closed. Let us keep the
business of receiving delegates open as late as possible so as to
hear from all organizations and not only those that we have heard
from so far. I think we should extend the seating of delegates to
Monday night on the ground that I have just stated. I make an
amendment to the motion, that the seating of delegates be
extended till Monday night. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment is that credentials be accepted
till Monday night. Is that the amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: That is the amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the amendment. Are you ready for
the question? The mover of this motion, Charles O. Sherman, has
the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I did not make that motion with the intent of
shutting out any one that comes here with good intent. This
proposition has been advertised since January, and the
organizations have had ample time to make preparation for
delegates and other preparations to attend this convention. I
believe that every organization that will come here with power to
act has come. They have taken their time, and have come here to
form an organization and pledge that organization that they will
support this organization when formed. They are here now, all
that are coming. (Applause.) I believe, or want to believe, that
every delegate that has been seated in this convention has come
here with a heart for humanity, that wants to see the working
class organized into a class-conscious movement that will move
together. We recognize the fact that this hall holds many
delegates that are here representing nothing but themselves, but
they are representing behind them an army of men who are
contributing to an organization that will throw bombs and all
other forces against this organization, no matter what it may be
when it is formed. They are supporting a movement that is to-day
using their national officers and their national forces to
destroy what we are trying to build up in this body. (Applause.)
They say we are revolutionists. If we are, let us do as
revolutionists do&mdash;know our friends by their acts. The
revolutionists of the trades union movement are in no way
affiliated with the American Federation of Labor or any other
scab federation. (Applause.) They. are outside of all
organizations that pay tribute to any parasite that sits in the
halls of New York and eats scab bread and smokes scab cigars.
(Applause.) They are on record. They do not pay tribute
financially, but they have kept their finances, what little they
have, and they have done what little they could to organize this
organization free from parasites. I want to be distinctly
understood that I have no feeling against any delegate here,
because I feel that they came here to do what little they could
to further the interests of the working class. But I do say that
those that are here without an organization backing them, though
they will carry out the principles that are laid down in this
organization when it is formed, I claim that they only represent
themselves, and I believe we have got enough of them here now. I
thank you. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I wish to say that I am heartily in favor of
the amendment to the original motion, and I wish to give any
reasons. The motion, to my view, is one that would probably undo
the work of our worthy brother that has just spoken. I take it
for granted that his intentions are good, as well as I believe we
could say the same of every one that is in this hall, although we
may differ on some things now and may later on. But when we start
our actions by excluding some one whom we first of all say we do
not fear, it goes without saying and it carries with it the idea
that we do fear. I believe as he said, that there are enough in
this convention at the present time to make it apparent to any
sensible minded person that this movement is now established. And
to bar out any individual, even though he or she may come in here
derogatory or opposed to this movement, I come back again and use
my words that there are enough here, at least in my estimation,
to outweigh those individuals. I take exception to the brother
when he says that we have enough. If it is a good thing we cannot
have too much of it. It is going to be determined whether it is a
good thing by the actions of this body. To pass this original
motion would, to my mind, be against the idea of it being good. I
want to say, although I represent an organization that has so far
stood aloof as far as giving their delegates a right to install,
we have at least shown a disposition, or they have shown a
disposition to find out, and have come here to learn, and I
believe that even though there may be some individuals who may
come in here from now till Monday night who would have ulterior
motives, yet at the same time among them may be some with other
motives, and we should not by any action of this convention bar
any one. If we do not fear them, then let us show it by our
action and vote the original motion down and adopt the amendment.
I also take exception to the brother when he slays that this
movement is a movement of individuals that have a heart for
humanity. If I understand the Manifesto aright it is simply a
movement born of the necessity of the working class coming
together for their emancipation, and not for humanity.
(Applause.) We have heard enough of this humanitarianism. Let our
actions, whatever they may be, be prompted by a clear
understanding of our economic environment. When we do this we
teach those that do not understand it. I believe this movement
will probably be the one that may possibly be the emancipation of
the working class. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. PAT O&rsquo;NEIL: I am surprised at some of the remarks I
have listened to. The gentleman said we don&rsquo;t want any more
men coming into this convention representing no one but
themselves. If that is true, then I am one too many here; you
know I represent no one but myself. I understood the terms of
that Manifesto to be that every man in the United States, whether
there was an organization behind him who at an expense of a few
dollars sent him to represent them or not, was entitled to a seat
and voice in this convention, and I came here in perfect good
faith feeling that way.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: The others didn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>DEL. O&rsquo;NEIL: I came and I am here. Now, it does not seem
to me that we have a right to close the door against any man who
wants to come in here. For instance, looking over the daily
papers this morning, I see that there is a general jubilation
among the delegates that some organizations are about to go to
pieces. There may be other unions that we know nothing about that
are about to do the same thing. How can we tell what other men
are going to do? Suppose some union men to-day, utterly disgusted
at the present conditions and management, should call for a
meeting tonight and send a delegate here to-morrow, we should not
like very well to refuse them a seat. It does not look to me that
we would want to. It seems to me, from what I have heard here,
that we would have just as much right to pass a resolution here
that we don&rsquo;t want any more men ever&mdash;to join the
organization&mdash;except those that are here and the ones they
represent, as we have to deny any delegate a seat in the house.
(Applause.) If we are going before the people of the United
States and Canada and Mexico and the balance of the world asking
men to join this organization, you have no right to refuse a man
entrance here now any more than you will have afterwards.
(Applause.) If he comes here with credentials representing
somebody, well and good. But if he comes here representing just
himself I believe in seating that man and giving him a right to
have a voice here. I cannot help but feel that way. And as far as
delegates being brought in here from Chicago to swamp this thing,
it will take a whole lot of votes to do it, when the Western
Federation of Miners is here with 27,000 votes in one bunch.
Possibly my views may not be liked by all the people in this
convention, but I am for the widest and fullest discussion
possible. I do not believe it is safe to get a man into this
organization unless he thoroughly understands where he is at. I
have seen many men come. into the Socialist movement on the spur
of the moment and become members of locals until election day,
and when it came time to do something they laid down flat.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: With the consent of my second I withdraw that
motion in order that the committees may get to work.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Does the delegate who offered the amendment
withdraw the amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: What is that?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegate who offered the original motion
requests the privilege of withdrawing his motion. I ask, do you
withdraw your amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: That would be the greatest pleasure to me.
Mother Jones then made an announcement in regard to the sale of a
book on the Colorado strikes.</p>
<p>The convention then at eleven o&rsquo;clock adjourned until
tomorrow morning at nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
