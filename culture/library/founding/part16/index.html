<h1>CONVENTION</h1>
<h1>Industrial Workers of the World</h1>
<h2>NINTH DAY</h2>
<h3>Thursday, July 6</h3>
<h3>AFTERNOON SESSION</h3>
<p>The convention was called to order by Chairman Haywood at 1.25
P.M.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: When the convention adjourned we had just
disposed of the motion to refer. The motion now occurs on the
adoption of Section 2 of Article I of the constitution as
recommended by the committee.</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann: I would ask, in order to eliminate too
much discussion, the consent of the Constitution Committee to
insert in their report on Section 2 the following clause:
&ldquo;Shall consist of thirteen industrial divisions subdivided
into industrial unions of closely connected industries in the
appropriate organizations for representation in the departmental
administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: Do you make that as a motion?</p>
<p>SECRETARY TRAUTMANN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>DEL. BRADLEY: I will second that motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the amendment offered by
Secretary Trautmann to Section 2, Article I of the
constitution.</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann: I believe that most of the delegates in
the convention are firmly decided upon these principles of
organization. I am satisfied that you all agree that we should
have a concentration of administration, and I am satisfied that
every one is willing to allow industrial subdivisions to have an
administration and a voice in the various industrial
subdivisions. The amendment would not change the structure of the
constitution as submitted to this convention. It would only guide
the incoming Executive Board so as to allow industrial
organizations to install themselves into this organization as
soon as it is launched. I believe that most of us have agreed,
and are agreed, that in years to come the concentration of this
organization will go on in line with the concentration of
capitalistic enterprises, and I believe also that a time of
transition should be allowed. The structure as laid down, or
foundation, by your Constitution Committee, gives ample time for
the incoming Executive Board of this organization to mete out the
detail work of this organization. They can subdivide, they can
arrange matters, they can have an organization flexible enough to
install the organizations into departments where they properly
belong. I believe also that even the diagram outlined, good as it
may be, does not settle all the affairs, and there should be
always room for discussion as to what would be the best for an
organization, as long as the membership of that organization are
willing to install themselves into this organization. According
to this amendment which I make, we agree that a central
administration should exist. This central administration should
be comprised of thirteen industrial divisions instead of
industrial unions. At the same time, in each division there
should be room for industrial organizations; and the industrial
organizations will install themselves in line with capitalistic
development. For instance, the United Brewery Workers to-day only
embrace a part of the brewery workers in all the departments. At
the same time I realize the fact that in conformity with the
plans of other countries the scope of the organization and the
plans that we may advance should embrace every man and every
woman employed in the industries of making beer, wine, liquor and
so on. So also do I believe that the tobacco industry should
include every one employed in the tobacco industry and that they
should have a right to have an organization of their own, but
they all should be subject to the rules of the general
organization, and should be allowed representation in the
administration of that respective department. You have
practically endorsed the plan of organization as outlined by the
Constitution Committee. It may not be perfect. I do not believe
it is perfect, but it is good enough for one year&rsquo;s work or
two years&rsquo; work, and then whatever defects we may find in
the plan of organization, they will be found out in one or two
years, and then your Executive Board will be able to make such
recommendations as to make the organization perfect. We have
agreed at this convention that we must have one principle laid
down. That principle is that we must adapt our constitution, our
methods, our forms of organization, as much as possible to the
development of capitalistic enterprises. This principle being
settled we should also give room for detail work for the incoming
Executive Board, and this can be settled by the Constitution
Committee when it adopts this small amendment, or this small
clause to be inserted in the article, which will not change,
amend or modify any one of the other clauses to follow, but will
simply allow the thirteen departments to stand in these
departments; the various organizations will shape themselves
according to the institutions of our times, and I believe this
will settle the local difficulties and give each organization a
chance to work out the best plans by which it can install itself
into this new proposed organization. It will allow room for the
working class to find the best place where they can get in, and
where they properly should be situated, and I believe this would
solve also the rest of the work of the Constitution Committee,
and would give a chance for the entire convention to adopt the
rest of the work of that committee. I do that for a purpose. I
have seen some of the Constitution Committee, and I believe that
they will agree upon these detailed sections of the constitution
if adopted by this convention with the consent of the
Constitution Committee, and we then know that we have the
structure laid, and in one year perhaps we can find all the
defects of the constitution and remedy them if we find it
necessary; and for that same reason Mr. Chairman,. I will make
that as a motion, that the Constitution Committee be requested to
insert that as a part of Section 2.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I understand now that this motion or this
amendment is before the house.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: This amendment is before the house.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to make a motion. I am willing to submit
this motion without any debate. I do it largely on account of
this new matter coming in and the temperament as I understood of
the convention when it voted on the previous motion. My motion is
this: I move that the present Constitution Committee be
discharged and the amendment now before the convention be
referred to a committee of the same number and selected in the
same manner as the present Committee on Constitution, with
instructions to report a constitution complying with the
Manifesto declaring for craft autonomy locally, industrial
autonomy internationally, and working class unity generally.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: I second the motion.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I wish to ask for a roll call, Mr. President.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I would say to the mover of the motion that the
motion will not be entertained by the Chair until such time as
the disposition of this convention is determined as to the plan
that has already been selected to form a Constitution Committee
of this convention. (Applause). The Chair will suspend his
decision in regard to this very serious matter. The committee
will be selected in the same manner as the present committee, as
this provides. Permit the Chair to say that in his opinion the
selection of the group from the Western Federation of Miners
would consist of identically the same delegate that is now on
that committee, the President of the Western Federation of
Miners. And it is the opinion of the Chair that the formation of
this committee would be identically the same as it is at the
present time, and until such time as this amendment has been
disposed of, and the sense of this convention in regard to the
committee that have already submitted their work has been
defined, the motion will be declared out of order. If you have a
desire to appeal from the decision of the Chair, you will be so
permitted.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Give me a chance. I want to say, Mr. Chairman,
that I appeal from the decision of the Chair, and in that appeal
I wish to state my reasons. My reasons for appeal is this: I
disagree with the Chairman when he says the make-up of the
committee will be the same. I do not believe the Chair or any
other delegate can assume that right or that position; I do not
believe it.</p>
<p>I make the appeal on another ground. Mr. Chairman, we have
realized all the way through that this Constitution Committee has
absolutely pledged itself to support this report, and we know
that behind that pledge is a sufficient number of votes to carry
that amendment. At the same time the temper of the resolution, or
rather of the convention, on the previous motion that was voted
on, to refer it back to the same committee, shows to us that
there are some members of the Constitution Committee that would
be willing to send it to some other committee. They are simply
standing together as a committee. They would prefer that this be
unloaded onto some other committee. Now, Mr. Chairman, that is my
only reason, and I do not think this convention ought to be
forced to go up against a committee that is absolutely pledged to
support this motion regardless of whether they are convinced that
it is right or that it is wrong; and I make my appeal on those
grounds, and I ask a roll call on the appeal.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chairman would take the position that every
member on this committee is placed on his honor; that after
coming into this convention and listening to the debate which has
consumed twenty hours of time, I say the members of this
committee must have absorbed some ideas, and that the will of
this convention stands above any action that may have been taken
in that committee. Delegate Miller, will you kindly take the
chair?</p>
<p>(Delegate Miller took the chair.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The decision of the Chair has been
appealed from. Does the Chair desire to state its reason for
making the decision?</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: I have already stated the reasons.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The question now occurs on the motion,
shall the decision of the Chair be sustained? Those who are in
favor of sustaining the decision of the Chair will, when their
delegations are called, record themselves as voting yes, and
those who are opposed to sustaining the decision of the Chair
will vote no. The Secretary will call the roll.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: They are putting the Chair in the wrong
light in presenting the proposition. I think Robert&rsquo;s Rules
of Order provides that when the Chair is appealed from it is not
a personal issue with the Chair, The way you put it makes it a
personal issue with the Chairman, which is not the case.
Consequently the motion should be put in this manner: Shall the
decision of the Chair be the judgment of this convention? That
relieves the Chairman of stating the issue of the proposition and
settles the responsibility of the decision upon the convention
itself.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: So far as the Chair is concerned, he is
of the opinion that the delegate&rsquo;s objection is a
distinction without a difference.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: What about the vote of my organization? I have a
telegram from my union, giving power to install.</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann: I have just received a telegram from the
Longshoremen&rsquo;s Union asking permission to cast its entire
strength of 400 votes. Will the convention allow his vote of 400
to be recorded on any roll call or in any action of the
convention?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: That should be decided later.</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the vote be so recorded and
that the delegate be permitted to cast the 400 votes.</p>
<p>Delegate De Leon moved the previous question.</p>
<p>Delegate Frye rose to a point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The previous question has been called
for on the question as to whether the gentleman representing the
Longshoremen&rsquo;s Union shall cast the entire vote of his
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Is that the motion?</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: A motion was made and entertained, as I
understood, that the member be allowed to record the vote of his
organization. That motion was seconded. The Chair entertained
that motion, and on that motion I rose, was recognized and moved
the previous question.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: It is not necessary to have any lengthy
discussion on this, and the Chair will call for the vote on that
question at once.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I rise to a point of order, that is all. I
don&rsquo;t want to discuss it. I do not know how this delegate
is going to vote, and I don&rsquo;t want to know. But I raise the
point of order that it is not in order, as there is a motion now
before the house, or there is an appeal, which is the same
thing.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The Chair would decide that it is the
sense of this convention to treat every delegate fairly and allow
him to be represented on every vital question coming before this
convention and therefore I will decide that the motion to allow
the delegate his full voting strength is in order.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I appeal from the decision. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The Chair will call Delegate Spiegel to
the Chair. Please be seated, as the Chair is not going to
recognize anybody until the gavel is in the hands of another
man.</p>
<p>(Delegate Spiegel assumed the chair.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The question before the house is on the
appeal from the decision of this Chairman (Del. Miller). Are you
ready for the question?</p>
<p>The question was called for by several delegates, and being
put, the decision of Chairman Miller was sustained.</p>
<p>(Delegate Miller resumed the duties of Chairman pro tem.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The question Is whether the
Longshoremen&rsquo;s Union shall cast the full strength of its
organization. (Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I wish to speak on this question.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The previous question has been called
for. It will be applied to this motion.</p>
<p>DEL. DANIEL MCDONALD: Mr. Chairman, I believe now is the time
to discuss this.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The chair has been sustained.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I rise to a point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Brother McDonald is out of order. DEL.
MCDONALD: The question cannot be called on the appeal, because
the appeal is not debatable.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Those who are in favor of allowing the
delegate from the Longshoremen&rsquo;s Union&mdash;</p>
<p>Previous question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Do you wish the previous question on
that?</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Shall the previous question be now
put?</p>
<p>Question called for, and being put, was declared carried.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Please inform us, Mr. Chairman, what the
previous question is.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Those who are in favor of seating the delegate
from the Longshoremen&rsquo;s Union will make it known by saying
aye. Contrary no.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: Is there any debate on that question?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: No.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: No? Then you have parliamentary anarchy, not
parliamentary law.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The convention will be in order. The
previous question was called for and carried. That took the
question beyond the realm of debate.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: The question before the house was the question
on the appeal from the decision of the Chair, and nothing else
can be entertained but that until that is decided.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The gentleman is out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: If anybody thinks that gag rule is going to
prevail he is certainly mistaken. I recognize the limitations of
parliamentary law, but I recognize the fact that parliamentary
law was instituted first on account of necessity.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Will the delegate please be seated?</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: There is no order here; no order in anything
that has been done on the past motion. In God&rsquo;s country I
am out of order? I am simply asserting myself as an
individual.</p>
<p>Cries of &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; and confusion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: If it is necessary the Chair will
appoint a sergeant-at-arms to preserve order.</p>
<p>Delegates: Good.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: If you so decide I shall quietly go outside
with any sergeant-at-arms that you may see fit to appoint. I
protest against the proceedings that are had here under the guise
of parliamentary law. It is anarchy, pure and simple.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: The previous question on the appeal from the
decision of the chair.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The question now occurs on the appeal
from the decision of the Chair.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman&mdash;</p>
<p>Secretary Trautmann: The Chair decided that he would not
entertain the amendment of Delegate Coates until the amendment of
Delegate Trautmann had been disposed of, and Delegate Coates then
appealed from the decision of the Chair.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Now the previous question has been
called for on this?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The Chairman simply asked a question for
information on the former motion, and now Delegate Coates desires
to state his reasons for appealing from the decision of the
Chair; was that it?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, I will state to you in just a
moment what I want. The only thing I have in mind, Mr. Chairman,
is to get this convention quiet so it can understand what it is
voting on before this roll is called, that is all. Now. I want to
appeal to the delegates, for heaven&rsquo;s sake let us not get
excited and undo absolutely our ten days&rsquo; work in this
convention. Now, let us understand, quietly and calmly, with the
best intentions in the world, and know just where we are now.
That is all I want. Now, the motion before the house, if the
Chair will permit me to state it in my way, is that I made the
motion to refer it to a new committee for the reason that I
believe it is the proper thing to do, to bring us out of this
turmoil. The Chair decided it was out of order. I have appealed
from that decision. The vote is, shall the decision of the Chair
be the decision of the convention? Now, all that are in favor of
the appeal will vote yes, and all who are in favor of my appeal
will vote no. Now let us not get into a turmoil before this vote
is over.</p>
<p>(Cries of &ldquo;roll call.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: If we can have quiet I wish to say
something.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: My brother, there is no discussion on
the appeal from the Chair other than by the person making the
decision and the man who makes the appeal. Now the Chair wishes
to state that those who vote yes on the question, &ldquo;Shall
the Chair be sustained?&rdquo; will sustain Delegate Haywood in
the decision that it was out of order to refer Delegate
Coates&rsquo; amendment to another committee along with the
report of the Constitutional Committee, and those who vote no
will vote in favor of the motion made by Delegate Coates.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: Will the Chair permit me to explain my position,
just one moment?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Yes.</p>
<p>(Cries of &ldquo;roll call.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: You will get the roll call. I just want to state
that the position I took in declaring this motion out of order in
selecting a new Constitution Committee was simply because we have
not yet heard an expression of this convention as to whether or
not the report of this. Constitution Committee met with your
favor. (Applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The roll call will now be called.</p>
<p>The Secretary proceeded with the roll call, during which the
following proceedings occurred:</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: I ask the delegation of the Western Federation
of Miners to cast my vote.</p>
<p>Various explanations were made during the roll call.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I don&rsquo;t concede the right of any delegate
to this convention to cast another delegate&rsquo;s vote. I have
taken that position all the way through. If it was one of our
delegates that was absent we were simply short that many votes.
We are not going to establish the proxy system right here, are
we?</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: We have been doing it. We simply cast the
entire delegation&rsquo;s vote.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: You have no right to do it, and I rise to that
point right now, and I will wait for the decision of the Chair on
that point right now.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I will state my position. The proposition as
presented to our membership vas this, that on all matters
affecting our organization materially the delegates were
instructed to vote a unit vote; that is, a majority of the
delegates should decide how that vote should stand in the
convention. That is the instructions from the membership of our
organization. Now you have here a delegation with 2,087 votes,
and if anyone of the delegates wishes to not comply with that
instruction it is simply necessary for him to withdraw from his
delegation and make application to be represented by himself as
an individual, otherwise the vote must be cast in accordance with
the instructions of our memberships on all matters vital to the
United Brotherhood of Railway Employes. If any delegate present
representing a division of our organization wishes, or has
instructions from his local, to cast his vote independent from
the general instructions, then he simply has to withdraw and ask
to be seated in the convention with the number of votes that is
represented in his local.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The Chair would wish to state his ruling
on that point. The Chair would decide that in the absence of any
rule by the convention it becomes the right of any delegation to
consider to decide the manner in which their vote shall be
cast.</p>
<p>Roll call asked for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Do you wish a roll call on that
proposition? That means that the delegations themselves decide
how the vote shall be cast.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Then the vote of the United Brotherhood of Railway
Employes is a unit on this proposition, 2,087 votes.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: No, sir, each delegate has the power to cast the
vote, and it has been recorded here.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: I think any further discussion of this
is out of order at the present time.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I just want to call your attention to the fact that
the vote is being recorded in opposition to your ruling. Now, I
am perfectly willing for Brother Hopkins to have his
representation and let him vote just as he pleases on all
questions just as he pleases. There is no doubt about that; but
if you do that you must take that number of votes from the
delegation representing the United Brotherhood of Railway
Employes. If he wants to cast his separately from the rest, and
not follow the instructions of the membership in their referendum
vote, then he would have to withdraw and cast that vote
independently, and it would be necessary for him to be seated
representing his division in the convention, according to your
ruling.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: It seems to the Chair rather strange
that this question should have waited until this late hour in the
day. On the vote that was taken just before dinner, the vote of
the U. B. R. E. was divided in the same way, some of the
delegates being absent and some present. Now, in figuring up the
vote of the U. B. R. E. the Chair simply wishes to announce to
this convention the method which he took of arriving at the total
vote. He concluded that the delegates who were present had a
right to cast the vote of the U. B. R. E., which would divide the
total vote cast by the number of delegates present. Multiply that
number by the number of men voting yes and the number voting no
and place it in the roll call.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: That is correct, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>DEL. FITZGERALD: I would like to say now for information to
the Chair, the reason for this motion&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The Chair does not consider it necessary
to state that.</p>
<p>DEL. FITZGERALD: I say the reason we divided that vote this
morning was that there were fourteen votes cast, seven each way.
Then it was for the delegates to take and divide the different
votes. Isn&rsquo;t that right in your opinion? But if there were
eight votes one way and six the other the eight would have had
the unit vote according to the referendum going out to the United
Brotherhood of Railway Employes.</p>
<p>THE SECRETARY: In all the delegations the records will show,
as to the organizations having power to install, that of such
delegations those who were not present were not counted at all,
and as to those who voted, we divided the total number of votes
among those who had voted. For instance, if a member of the
delegation of the American Labor Union had been absent, his
absence was so recorded, and the vote of the entire delegation
was divided between those who were present. That was, as you can
later on see in the roll call, done by the Secretary. If the
convention does not agree with it, certainly it will be
changed.</p>
<p>(Roll called for.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: Any further discussion on this matter
will be out of order. The roll call will be proceeded with.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: I am willing to pair with Delegate Coates on
this proposition.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: All right, I will vote no.</p>
<p>DEL. HAYWOOD: All right, I will vote yes. (Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. RIORDAN: I am not claiming to support the report of the
committee, and I do not think we have pledged ourselves to it. I
am going to vote for what in my judgment is for the best
interests of the convention. I vote no on that proposition.</p>
<p>The roll call was finished by the Secretary.</p>
<p>Delegate Sherman here came to the front, stating that he had
been absent, and asked permission to vote. A delegate objected on
the ground that the vote had been closed. The Chairman ruled that
any delegate had the right to vote or change his vote at any time
before the result of the roll call was announced.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: The vote stands: Yeas, 25,710; noes,
22,473. The decision of the Chair is sustained.</p>
<p>[For detailed vote on roll-call, see appendix.]</p>
<p>(Delegate Haywood resumed the Chair.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question occurs upon the amendment
introduced by Delegate Trautmann. All those in favor of the
amendment will signify by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is
carried. The vote now occurs on the report of the Constitution
Committee, on Section 2, Article I, as amended by this motion.
Are you ready for the question? (Question called for). Those in
favor of the motion will signify it by saying aye. Contrary
no.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: We have got to a point where we are going to have
a little scrap.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You can get it.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want a roll call, and I ask decently for
it.</p>
<p>A delegate moved to dispense with the roll call.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I appreciate your services, but we will not take
an opportunity for a roll call away from the convention; no,
no.</p>
<p>Chairman: A roll call may be asked for, and a roll call will
be provided unless otherwise disposed of by this convention.
However, the Chair takes the position that we may have a viva
voce vote, and before announcing it any delegate may ask for a
roll call, and it is not necessary to have any scrap over it.
While the roll call is being prepared by the Secretary, it has
been suggested by one of the committee on ratification meeting
that there is an announcement to make. Listen to the
committee.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: I do not understand the necessity for a roll
call being prepared by the Secretary, when he already has a roll
call and has been repeatedly calling from that roll.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I will just say for the benefit of the delegate
that it is necessary every time the roll is called to have a
transcript of all the names.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I would like to ask a question of the gentleman.
Do you ask for a roll call because you are in doubt as to how the
motion is going to go, or is it for the purpose of wasting the
time of this convention? (Applause). I want to say, Mr. Chairman,
that I will stay in this convention for a year, if necessary.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I want to say to the delegate that it is not for
the purpose of wasting time. I want a record, and the convention
wants a record, I believe; that is all.</p>
<h4>RATIFICATION MEETING.</h4>
<p>DEL. HELD: As the chairman of the ratification committee I
wish to announce that the committee has made and adopted the
following program, without any recommendation, to leave it to the
convention to do what it pleases about it: &ldquo;We, the
committee, have adopted the following program: Grand ratification
meeting of the Industrial Workers of the World, to be held at
Brand&rsquo;s Hall, corner of Clark and Erie streets, July 7,
1905. Meeting will be called at 8 P. M. The speakers will be:
Eugene V. Debs, Daniel De Leon, William D. Haywood, Thomas J.
Hagerty, C. O. Sherman, Charles Moyer, William E. Trautmann.
David C. Coates, and others, will speak on the necessity of the
working class organizing under the banner of the industrial
Workers of the World.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Mr. Chairman, I certainly intended yesterday, on
the report of this committee, in what I said to the convention,
to decline to address that mass meeting, and if the convention
did not understand me at that time, I wish to withdraw my name
from this list, because I shall not address that mass
meeting.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: As one of that committee on arrangements for the
mass meeting, I will also say that it was the sense of the
committee that this ratification meeting be not held until such
time as the constitution is adopted and we thoroughly understand
what &ldquo;industrialism&rdquo; means, so that there will be no
confusion among the speakers on the platform, and I thought that
was the sense also of that committee on this ratification
meeting; that this convention allow further time, and not expect
it to-morrow night, but to wait until such time as the
constitution is adopted, and the speakers can confine themselves
strictly to the questions provided in the constitution.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the report of your committee.
What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I move its adoption. I said yesterday that I did
not want to disappoint any one by being announced as a speaker at
the mass meeting to be held here on Friday night. I can say to
the convention and the committee that it will be impossible for
me to address a mass meeting here to-morrow night. I say this in
all sincerity, and I wish the convention to take me at my
word.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: I move that the report of the committee be
adopted, and that the names of the delegates who have spoken be
removed from the list, as they cannot speak at that meeting.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>Motion carried.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: Mr. Chairman, do I understand by the adoption of
that report of the committee that the meeting of to-morrow night
is postponed.</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: Not at all.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Sherman, did you have some special
business to bring before the convention?</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. PARSONS: Mr. Chairman, I rise to ask the Chair a
question. Is it or is it not according to parliamentary rules to
put a motion and have it carried when a delegate is upon the
floor asking to speak upon that motion? I do not know; I am not
very well up in parliamentary rules.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair will state that after a question is
put and the Chair asks, &ldquo;Are you ready for the
question?&rdquo; and takes the floor to put the motion, when a
delegate arises at that time he will not be recognized. Proceed
with the roll call. The question is on the adoption of Section 2
of Article I as amended by Delegate Trautmann&rsquo;s amendment.
Read the amendment.</p>
<h4>CONSTITUTION, RESUMED.</h4>
<p>The amendment was read as follows: &ldquo;Thirteen industrial
divisions subdivided into industrial unions of closely kindred
industries in the appropriate organizations for representation in
the departmental administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I will move that we insert the word
&ldquo;industrial&rdquo; before &ldquo;organization&rdquo; in
that amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order. The roll call will
be proceeded with.</p>
<p>The roll call was then taken by the Secretary, during which a
number of explanations were made, among them the following:</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: I want to say that if I had a million votes I
would cast them against it, because by adopting the last
amendment you are creating an organization with more heads and
more officials to keep up with than you have in the American
Federation of Labor, and I vote no.</p>
<p>DEL. PARKS: Mr. Chairman, I want to state my reason for the
vote which I gave. I object to the parliamentary railroading that
has lately been inaugurated in this convention. Therefore I vote
no.</p>
<p>The roll call was finished and computed by the Secretary.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Section 2 of Article I as amended is carried
Yeas, 39,127; noes, 12,061.</p>
<p>[For detailed vote on roll-call, see appendix.]</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair at this time wants to resent any
imputation on the part of any delegate that there has been any
parliamentary railroading of any proposition m this floor. Two
days and a half of time have been consumed in discussing this
proposition, and then a delegate Las the impudence to get on the
floor and say something has been railroaded. (Applause.) The
Secretary will proceed with the reading of the next paragraph.
Delegate Coates, will you kindly take the chair?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I will kindly ask to decline now. I thank you,
but I do not want to preside.</p>
<p>Delegate Sherman was asked to preside, but declined.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Coates, will you permit the Chair to
insist that you take the Chair for a few minutes?</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: No, Mr. Chairman, I do not care to preside.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, you are not in any danger of getting into
any scrap.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: All right; I don&rsquo;t want to preside. I thank
you very much.</p>
<p>The Chairman requested Delegate Bradley to take the Chair, but
he declined, and Delegate Ferber was called to the Chair.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty read the next section, as follows:</p>
<p>SEC. 3. The financial and industrial affairs of each
International Industrial Union shall be conducted by an Executive
Board of not less than seven (7) nor more than twenty-one (21),
selected by the general membership of said International
Industrial Union, provided that the Executive Board and general
membership of the said International Industrial Union shall at
all times be subordinate to the General Executive Board of the
Industrial Workers of the World, subject to appeal, and provided
the expenses of such referendum shall be borne by the
International Industrial Union, or Unions, involved.</p>
<p>It was moved that the section be adopted. Seconded.</p>
<p>DEL. MURTAUGH: It has been so long since the entire
constitution as presented was read that the majority of the
delegates are unable to grasp what the entire constitution means,
and I believe the entire constitution should be read so that we
can understand it in all its parts before voting upon any other
section. I move that the entire constitution be read.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>Motion put and lost.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question is now before the house on the
adoption of this particular section. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>The question was called for, and being put, was carried and
the section declared adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: Will the Chair kindly request the Secretary to
make a note on the minutes that Delegate Coates is not voting on
this proposition? THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will please take
notice that Delegate Coates is not voting.</p>
<p>DEL. COATES: I wish it to apply to every section of this
constitution.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: I am an old schoolmaster, and I have
never presided anywhere unless there was perfect order, and while
I maintain my position as Chairman we will have to have perfect
order or there will not be any work.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty of the committee read Section 4, as
follows:</p>
<p>Sec. 4. INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS shall have jurisdiction in local
affairs over the unions of which they are composed, but shall at
all times be subordinate to the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD
and submit a copy of their constitution to the General Executive
Board for approval.</p>
<p>DEL. EISENBERG: I move you that that be adopted.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I rise to a point of information. Will the
Secretary please explain just what that means, so that the
delegates will understand it? Does it mean that in a certain
community a number of locals can form together and establish some
kind of a government or some kind of a central council? Is that
what it means?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: In the section adopted by the convention
there are included central bodies. &ldquo;Central bodies composed
of seven or more local unions in two or more industries shall be
known as industrial councils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I would like to amend the motion as made, by a
motion to strike out that part of this section, and I will
explain why I would like to have that struck out. I think an
economic organization must fight as much as possible anything
like a geographical division of the working people. I think one
of the best indications that we have in the world that the
revolution of 1776 was not a working class revolution, was that
the country over which the government was established was laid
out in geographical sections instead of economic divisions. Now,
going back somewhat into history, we find that the old free
cities of Germany had their governments protected upon a
different principle, and that was that all sections of society
were represented in the government. Now, we have departed from
that and established in this country a form of government on
geographical lines that permit one class of people, that is the
wealthy class, being elected as the representatives in the
government. That is why we have drifted towards plutocracy
instead of drifting towards democracy. Now, the point where it
applies in the economic movement is this: I have had a great deal
of experience with central councils, and I have never yet seen
one of them that proposed anything for the economic needs of the
working people. Those councils have always been used for
political purposes, and wherever you find a central council you
will find it dominated by some one person for political purposes.
He will dominate it for a selfish purpose. If we confine his
field of action to the local of which he is a member, the scope
of his influence is limited, and I certainly hope that anything
in the shape of a central council, a state council or anything of
that kind will be knocked out of this constitution. I believe
that if we establish that precedent and permit locals to organize
themselves and come into a central council, we will drift away
from that point which we wish to reach. You may rest assured that
if in the city of Chicago there is permitted to be established a
central council in which all locals may be permitted to have
representation, that central will drift into a political ring
that will eventually become just as corrupt as some have accused
the Chicago Federation of Labor of being in the city of Chicago.
It does not make any difference about what form of organization
it is, it will not make any difference. You declare for the
irrepressible struggle between the capitalists and laboring men,
but results later will make no difference; it will gradually
drift into the affairs of the organization, and we should take
steps at this time to eliminate any possibility of that kind.
There is no economic interest that can be served by a central
organization. If there is a proposition coming up involving the
different locals in certain sections, those locals may discuss
the proposition without having a central organization.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I rise to a point of order. These
industrial organizations have already been adopted by Section 1
of this constitution, unless Brother Hall wants to throw the
whole discussion open again.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: How is that adopted?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: In Section 1, providing for the thirteen
international industrial divisions, a central body and local
unions.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Read that particular section for the
enlightenment of Brother Hall and others.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: No, it is not for my enlightenment. If I understand
what has already been adopted, the groupings are in economic
groupings, but they are not geographical groupings.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Is your objection to these industrial councils?
Because if it is we have to throw open Section 1 again, for they
are provided for there.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I admit that I have been asleep.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Section 2 as amended here reads in this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall be composed of thirteen international industrial
divisions subdivided into industrial unions, of closely kindred
industries in the appropriate organizations for representation in
the departmental administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: That does not establish any such&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Then the divisions are specified here. That is
in paragraph A. You don&rsquo;t want all the divisions read over
again?</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: No.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Paragraph B: &ldquo;Central bodies composed of
seven or more local unions in two or more industries, and shall
be known as industrial councils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: That is exactly the one I am fighting against now.
That has not been adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: That has been adopted. Section 1 has been
adopted. We are at Section 2 now. Rather, we are at Section 4, I
mean.</p>
<p>DEL. PRYOR: I would like to ask the committee whether the
interpretation of that council is that there would be no
international bodies whatsoever except this? You provide for
central bodies, the grouping into central or district councils.
You make no provision, in my estimation, for any international
bodies over them except this. The adoption of that practically
means the adoption of all international bodies except this. Is
that the interpretation you place upon it? I would like to ask
that question of the Chair.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEM: I do not understand the question
thoroughly. The Chair is unable to give you the information. If
Brother Hagerty or any member of the committee will volunteer to
do that, very well. If you will, just set the brother right.
Brother Sherman will give you that information.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: The section reads seven or more local unions,
composing two different internationals,&mdash;they must come from
at least two,&mdash;which bars the proposition in an industrial
center where there would only be a representation of one
international organization, and they felt that they would not
need any central body, but your committee believes that there is
good comes from central bodies in industrial centers. The brother
who preceded me pointed out some very strong points, as, we who
have had experience know, that these central bodies have been
used more for political purposes many times than for economic
purposes. But we provide there, which no other proposition has
ever provided, that their constitution must be first submitted to
the General Executive Board before they are legally an
organization and can go forward and do business. The general
constitution holds in line the whole structure as to the
formation and the handling of the different crafts. Regardless of
what political stigma has been put upon the central bodies, I
believe that organizations and local unions, whether they be
connected with an international or whether they be connected
directly with the General Executive Board, that they can do good
in large industrial centers by delegates representing those
unions coming together on stated occasions and there discussing
questions that are at issue in that one industrial center. I
believe that good has been done in the city of Chicago. While I
believe that many times it has been detrimental, I believe that
came from the fact that the form of organization under which the
trades unions are now existing and the authority that is in
themselves under the present form of central bodies, with no
restrictions from any central heads, particularly is to blame for
it more than the central body. Further on, those of you who have
read this constitution, you will see that we did not recognize
that central body only as a local affair, as they are not
permitted to have any representatives in any national convention,
which is the case at the present time with the central bodies.
The central body should not be recognized in a national
convention, because of the fact that the central body itself is
made up of organizations that will be represented in that body. I
feel that it is absolutely necessary at this time to provide for
these central bodies. You must remember, brothers, while I regret
it, that the American working people are not prepared for
anarchy&mdash;I wish they were&mdash;the law of love does not
prevail, and there has got to be some line laid down whereby
these propositions can be handled from an organic standpoint, and
those laws have got to be made by the representatives of those
who are going to participate in the movement. I feel that the
central body could be of no harm to the movement, but I feel that
it would be of great good in industrial centers where every
sister and brother from Chicago, New York and large centers know
that it is absolutely necessary for the trades, no matter how
they are affiliated in nationals or whether they are
independent&mdash;it is absolutely necessary for committees to
come together, and you cannot get those committees together
without you have some kind of a plan whereby they recognize the
necessity of every so often meeting and discussing such questions
as are before the working people locally.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: I would ask for some member of that
committee to explain and answer a question. He has omitted it all
the way through, as to the abolition of the international heads.
He did not answer the question. I want a yes or no to that
question.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: We are now discussing Section 4. The other
things in this constitution, the question the delegate here
asked, ought to be asked in its right place when we come to it.
If we are to take up ten minutes at a time asking questions in
relation to a section not under discussion, we will never get
through. This question is answered in its proper place. This is
Section 4 now.</p>
<p>DEL. PAYNE: I ask for information. What I want to know is
about this two or more kindred organizations or kindred trades
that make up the central bodies, when there are seven or more
locals. Is that the way this is made?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Industrial organizations are defined in this
way: &ldquo;Paragraph B. Central bodies composed of seven or more
local unions in two or more industries, and shall be known as
industrial organizations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. PAYNE: What I want to know is if Delegate Hall has a
different proposition that would be better. I am seeking for
information on that.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: The section under discussion is Section 4.
&ldquo;Industrial councils shall have jurisdiction in local
affairs over the unions of which they are composed, and shall at
all times be subordinate to the Industrial Workers of the World,
and submit a copy of their constitution to the General Executive
Board for approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. AYERS: I move its adoption. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded that Section be
adopted. Are you ready for the question. (Question called
for.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I want that in conformity with the section that
has been passed previously, which provides that international
organizations are admitted in various divisions, the local unions
ought to be under the supervision of those international
organizations. I don&rsquo;t see how else you will amend it.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: That is an important point that he has brought up
there. The report of the committee did not originally intend for
these subdivisions to be divided into international industrial
unions. Now, the amendment divides it into international
industrial unions, and therefore, as we claim, the central body
should not have jurisdiction over these locals. The jurisdiction
should come from the international, as we want a continuity of
interest passing through the international. There should be a
perfect connection passing through the international.
Doesn&rsquo;t that require an amendment, Brother Hagerty?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: The section under discussion is Section 4, and I
presume that the adoption&mdash;at least it is my personal
opinion&mdash;that the adoption of the amendment to Section 2, or
the Trautmann amendment, namely, that the Industrial Workers of
the World shall be composed of thirteen international industrial
divisions, subdivided in industrial unions of closely kindred
industries, that that probably carries the change of name all the
way through the constitution. It is to be understood, because
when we refer back to Section 1 in this constitution we refer to
the name in the original report, &ldquo;International Industrial
Union,&rdquo; and if that has been amended to read
&ldquo;International Industrial Divisions,&rdquo; I presume it is
the sense of that amendment that wherever the words
&ldquo;International Industrial Unions&rdquo; occur it should be
read &ldquo;International Industrial Divisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I did not want any confusion.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: Why do we discuss the jurisdiction of the local or
central council? I contend we are discussing the jurisdiction of
the subordinate council.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>The question was then put and carried and the section declared
adopted.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty then read the next section, as follows:</p>
<p>SEC. 5. LOCAL UNIONS, as provided for in Article I, Section 2
(c), shall be directly subordinate to the General Executive Board
of the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD and a local constitution
for their government must be approved by the General Executive
Board.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I move you the adoption of that part of the
constitution. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been moved and seconded that Section 5 be
adopted. Are you ready for the question? (Question called
for.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: I would ask, as a special favor to myself, that
the Secretary be requested to read that particular section again
that we voted upon.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Local unions are defined in Section 1, paragraph
C, as being any such industries as are not represented on the
General Executive Board.</p>
<p>The question was called for and carried, and the section
declared adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Is it in order that Article I be adopted
now?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is that all of that article?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: That is all of Article I.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is it the sense of this convention that Article
I shall be adopted as amended ? As many as are in favor of the
motion please answer aye. Those opposed no.</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: I rise to a point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: State the point.</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: There has been no motion to adopt this, and you
have no authority to call for a vote on it without a motion.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Are you going to take it in sections or how? DEL.
HOPKINS: I ask the Secretary to read the motion made when this
committee first reported, that this constitution be adopted
seriatim. Read the motion that was passed by the convention at
that time.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Doesn&rsquo;t the adoption of these sections
carry the adoption of the article? I am not here to split hairs
with you. Is that the sense that Article I is now adopted by this
convention?</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: Oh, no.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: If you are here to split hairs or anything of
that sort we will never get through.</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: I want things done in the proper way and
manner.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I will rule you out of order. The various
sections have already been adopted. Now the question occurs on
whether we will take up and re-indorse these sections.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: I care not whether you pass an article at
a time as a whole or whether you wait until the entire
constitution is acted on, but when final action is had on the
constitution I shall ask a roll call vote before it is finally
adopted.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The roll call vote will be so ordered.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I would say it is better to go through the
constitution and act on every section separately, and when you
get through with it, then act on the matter as a whole, and one
roll call vote should do the business one way or the other.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Then you mean, Brother Sullivan, that we
dispense with that at the present time?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: And go on with the reading of the next
section?</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: Yes, to save time.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If that is the consensus of the opinion of the
convention I shall so rule.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: After we have adopted this seriatim all the matter
is open again. Does that mean that any section that has preceded
can be amended?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair does not so hold.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Why not adopt it then as we go over it?</p>
<p>DEL. FAIRGRIEVE: After the constitution has been read as a
whole all the way through then the matter will revert to the roll
call for its adoption, and then we who object to it or any part
of it can cast our votes on every section.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: I rise to a point of order. My point is this,
that the motion that was carried on the presentation of the
constitution proposed by the Constitution Committee&mdash;it was
decided by motion that this constitution should be taken up
seriatim, which will mean clause by clause, and not to be adopted
section by section or article by article when amended. My point
of order is this, that no motion can be entertained by the
Chairman to adopt any section or any article until the whole
constitution has been read and amended, and then it will be
accepted or rejected as a whole. That is my point.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Your point is well taken. The Chair does so
rule.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty of the committee read the next article, as
follows:</p>
<p>ARTICLE II: OFFICERS&mdash;HOW SELECTED AND THE DUTIES
THEREOF.</p>
<p>SECTION I. The officers of the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD
shall be a General President, a General Secretary-Treasurer and
an Executive Board composed of the above named officers and one
president of each International Division.</p>
<p>DEL. CRANSTON: I would like to amend that section to read as
to the members of the international divisions that the word
&ldquo;president&rdquo; be stricken out and the word
&ldquo;member&rdquo; be substituted.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I think that is all right. The words
&ldquo;member&rdquo; and &ldquo;president&rdquo; occur here
almost interchangeably, and I presume that it is the sense, so
far as I understand the Constitution Committee, that the word
&ldquo;member&rdquo; be used in other parts.</p>
<p>DEL. CRANSTON: Instead of having the president to be president
and a member of the Executive Board, that he be elected; but it
is open to the international to elect a member instead of the
president. It should not be compulsory that the president should
be the one that represents them, but any member should be
eligible to represent them. Instead of the word
&ldquo;president&rdquo; let any member be elected. I insist upon
it in that way.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I would like to ask the secretary another question.
Do you provide that all these men shall come from a
department?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Here is a part of the constitution. Section 5 of
another article specifies that the other members of the General
Executive Board shall be elected by their respective
international industrial divisions in accordance with their
prescribed rules, so that the use of the word
&ldquo;president&rdquo; here, I suppose, is just a slip of the
pen on the part of the man who first made the notes, or made
these transcripts. Here it is provided for, so it makes no
difference.</p>
<p>DEL. CRANSTON: That has been the great trouble with a good
many constitutions that have been drawn up, that one part of the
constitution would specify one thing, and another part of the
constitution absolutely contradict it. I think it is the sense of
this convention that the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; be inserted
instead of the word &ldquo;president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: It is a blunder on the part of the man
transcribing it.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: It is not a mistake on the part of the
sub-committee that prepared that part of the constitution. That
reads just as the sub-committee intended as it should, so it is
not a mistake.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I did not understand it so in the
Constitution Committee, and would not agree to that sort of thing
from the reading of it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The mover of the amendment wishes to insert in
Section I, the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; instead of the word
&ldquo;president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. CRANSTON: Yes.</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>DEL. GLASGOW: I rise to a point of information. Is that member
to be elected? It does not say that he is to be.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: It is provided in this constitution that a
member be elected from each international industrial
division.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question has been called for. Are you ready
for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I demand a roll call on the amendment, as chairman
of the committee.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: In behalf of the delegation here I would ask
Brother Moyer to please withdraw the motion, because it would
take up too much time. We want to get through with that business,
and don&rsquo;t want to go through with that again.</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: If the Constitution Committee other than myself
have no objections, I have no objection.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I have no objection to that motion as a member
of that committee, for that is the way I understood that thing. I
was not present at drawing it up. I think it is merely a quibble
on a technicality.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I have no objection.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Do you then withdraw your insistence upon the
roll call, Delegate Moyer?</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: If there is no objection on the part of the other
members of the Committee on Constitution.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If there are any members here of the Committee
on Constitution, please state your objections now.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chairman. I will state that that was
perfectly worded that way by the sub-committee who prepared that
article. It was given some little consideration, and that is just
as much the intent of the committee as any other wording of that
report; but rather than to impose on the convention the time
necessary for a roll call, I will willingly waive any personal
objection I may have to making the change, although it is my
opinion that it should remain just the way it is. I am willing,
however, for the sake of time, to waive that personal objection.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Have you any objections, Delegate Sullivan? Then
we will revert to the question. As many as are in favor of
inserting the word, now, will say aye. Contrary, no. The motion
is carried, and the committee will please insert the word
&ldquo;member&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delegate Hagerty read the next question, as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Section 2. The General President and General
Secretary-Treasurer shall be nominated from the floor of the
convention, and the three candidates for each respective office
receiving the greatest number of votes in the convention shall be
submitted to the general membership of the organization for
election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. PAYNE: I would like to say that we have only passed on
amendments to Section 1. We have not adopted Section 1 as
yet.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is right.</p>
<p>DEL. GILLHAUS: I move that Section 1 be adopted as amended.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried and the section was declared
adopted.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It now occurs upon the next section which has
been read. A motion will now be entertained for its adoption.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I move its adoption. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried and the section declared
adopted.</p>
<p>Delegate Hagerty read the next section as follows:</p>
<h4>DUTIES OF GENERAL PRESIDENT.</h4>
<p>Section 3. The General President is the Executive head of the
INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD and its chief executive officer.
He shall be nominated and elected as provided for in Article II,
Section 2, . and shall hold office until his successor is duly
elected and installed. He shall preside at all conventions and
meetings of the General Executive Board of the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS
OF THE WORLD and he shall be only a delegate-at-large to the
general conventions. He shall convene the General Executive Board
when, in his judgment it is to the interest of the Organization
and he shall convene the General Executive Board when requested
in writing by a majority of the members of said board. He shall,
upon the written request of one hundred (100) local unions,
representing not less than three (3) industries with a total
membership of not less than I5,000 members, call a special
convention of the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF HE WORLD at such time and
place as are designated by the General Executive Board.</p>
<p>If, in his judgment, the official action of the General
Secretary-Treasurer, or a member of the General Executive Board,
is detrimental to the best interests of the organization, he
shall make a complaint in writing, setting forth such charges,
and shall convene the General Executive Board within ten (10)
days to investigate said charges and take action thereon. If the
General Executive Board, by a majority vote, sustain and justify
the President in making said complaint, they may suspend or expel
the member of the General Executive Board, or the
Secretary-Treasurer, as the case may be, and shall fill any
vacancy that may occur in either office; provided, that in case
it is a member of the General Executive Board his industrial
union organization shall be advised of such action and be
requested to fill said vacancy within ninety days; provided, that
the person selected by the Executive Board shall be empowered to
act with like power of any other member of the Board until the
industrial organization shall elect a person to fill the place,
who shall immediately be installed in office. But in case it is
the General Secretary-Treasurer the person selected by the
General Executive Board shall fill the office until the next
general election unless removed for cause.</p>
<p>The General President shall have entire supervision of the
entire affairs of the organization and watch vigilantly over its
interests throughout its jurisdiction. In this he shall be
assisted by the officers and members of all organizations
subordinate to the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD. He shall,
with the approval of the General Executive Board, appoint such
organizers as the condition of the organization may justify. All
organizers shall at all times work under the instructions of the
General President, and all organizers, while in the employ of the
INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD, shall report to the General
President in writing, on blanks provided for that purpose, at
least once each week. They shall receive as compensation for
their services such sum or sums as shall be fixed by the General
Executive Board.</p>
<p>The General President shall at each general convention render
a report in detail of the work of his office since the last
convention, and shall make such recommendations as will, in his
judgment, advance the interests of the organization. He shall
travel throughout the jurisdiction whenever the affairs of the
organization will permit of his doing so, and he shall be
empowered to examine the books and workings of any union or
organization of the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD when able to
do so for the purpose of determining whether or not the union or
organization is complying with the general constitution.</p>
<p>He shall be empowered to employ such clerical help as may be
necessary to conduct the affairs of his office. The remuneration
for the clerical help employed by the General President shall be
fixed by the General Executive Board. He shall be held liable for
all official acts or documents emanating from his office, whether
done personally or by a clerk or stenographer. He shall sign all
vouchers drawn by the Secretary-Treasurer and countersign all
checks before any moneys are drawn from the treasury.</p>
<p>He shall devote his entire time to the affairs of the
organization, and shall receive as compensation such sum or sums
as the convention or General Executive Board may determine.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: What shall be done with the section as read?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: Do I understand that the President shall hold
office until his successor is duly elected and installed?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, sir, that is as it should be.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: Or otherwise removed for cause?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is provided later.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: The question I wanted to ask is this, does that
mean the election of President, or the tenure of office, will be
from one convention to the other?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You ask, does it mean that?</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It means until this convention, or some other
convention which shall be next convened, shall see fit to so
elect a president and install him. That is just exactly what it
means.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I would like to amend that section in such a manner
that the compensation of the General President, and the
compensation of the General Secretary-Treasurer, shall not exceed
$1,800 a year for the latter, and $2,200 a year for the former. I
am simply making these figures to get the matter before the
convention in order to get some idea as to what the sense of the
convention is.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Hall, if you will reduce that particular
amendment regarding the President only to writing, the Chair will
entertain it.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I want to offer an amendment to that section. I
want it so amended as to read that the term of the President
shall be one year, and not to be elected more than four
consecutive terms, and such elections to be by referendum vote.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>(Here Delegate Haywood resumed the chair.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the reading of Section 3 of
Article II, and the amendment offered by Delegate Ross. What is
the pleasure of the convention in regard to this amendment?</p>
<p>A delegate requested that the amendment be read again.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Amend said section to read that the term of the
President shall be one year, not to be elected more than four
consecutive terms, such election to be by referendum vote.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I move that it be adopted.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. MOYER: I shall have to ask for a roll call on the
amendment, as a member of the Committee on Constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I want to have it distinctly understood by every
delegate in this convention that I am not calling in question the
honesty of purpose of this committee, in regard to any man that
may be elected President, but I want to say that from the hitter
experience of myself and others, so far as the labor
organizations of this country are concerned, the continuous
service of one man at the head of an organization more than four
terms is detrimental. Remember, I do not bring this charge to
this work, but I am trying to have it not happen.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I rise to a point of order.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: State it.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: The subject that this delegate is discussing has
already been decided in Section 2, about the referendum for the
election of President, and that is not now under discussion.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: It did not state the term of service.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: At the convention; &ldquo;shall be nominated by
the convention.&rdquo; The constitution later on fixes the
conventions at but one a year.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: That is nomination, but I am speaking about his
election.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: He is elected by the general membership.</p>
<p>DEL. HELD: I move that the motion be laid on the table.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is the delegate willing to withdraw his
amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I am willing to withdraw the amendment, provided
the Secretary will read the portion that covers that ground.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will please read Section 2 that
has been adopted.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY (reading): &ldquo;The General President and
General Secretary-Treasurer shall be nominated from the floor of
the convention, and the three candidates for each respective
office receiving thee greatest number of votes in the convention
shall be submitted to the general membership of the organization
for election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: And the term of office?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: The term of office is decided later on in the
constitution by the voice of the convention.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Then I withdraw the motion.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I will withdraw my second.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Permit the Chair to state to this convention in
the consideration of this constitution that you are merely
adopting a provisional constitution. That this convention should
not undertake at this time to build a constitution for this
organization, but permit it to go before the working class of
this country and come into the next convention prepared to build
a constitution that will meet the requirements. Now, all these
amendments might at this time be dispensed with. Simply have a
provisional constitution, one with a foundation solid enough and
a structure strong enough to hold this organization together
until we meet together again. Now, the amendment occurs on
Section 3 of Article II. Are you ready for the question?
(Question called for.) Those in favor of the adoption will
signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried.</p>
<p>DEL. DE LEON: I rise for information. Was that motion of
Delegate Hall&rsquo;s entertained?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I haven&rsquo;t heard any motion from Delegate
Hall or anybody else. The Secretary will read.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I thought I was voting on Delegate Hall&rsquo;s
amendment.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Hall&rsquo;s amendment was not seconded
before that amendment. The Secretary will proceed with the
reading.</p>
<p>The Secretary read the next section as follows:</p>
<h4>DUTIES OF THE GENERAL SECRETARY-TREASURER</h4>
<p>Section 4. The duties of the General Secretary-Treasurer shall
be to take charge of all books, papers and effects of the office.
He shall be nominated and elected as provided for in Article II,
Section 2, and shall hold office until his successor is duly
elected, qualified and installed, except in case he shall he
removed from office, when his place shall be filled as provided
for in Article II, Section 3, under the &ldquo;Duties of General
President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shall conduct the correspondence pertaining to his office;
he shall be the custodian of the Seal of the Organization and
shall attach the same to all official documents over his official
signature; he shall provide such stationery and office supplies
as are necessary for the conducting of affairs of the
Organization; he shall act as Secretary at all meetings of the
General Executive Board and all conventions and furnish the
Committee on Credentials at each convention a statement of the
financial standing of each International Industrial Union,
Industrial Council and Local Union.</p>
<p>The General Secretary-Treasurer shall close his accounts for
the fiscal year on the last day of February for each year. He
shall make a monthly financial report to the General Executive
Board and a quarterly financial report to the general membership,
through the General Executive Board, and he shall make a complete
itemized report of the financial and other affairs of his office
to each Annual Convention.</p>
<p>He shall attest the signature of the General President to all
official documents and shall prepare and sign all charters issued
by the General Executive Board. He shall receive all moneys for
charters, dues, assessments and supplies from International
Industrial Unions, Industrial Councils, Local Unions and
Members-at-Large; he shall receipt for same and care for and
deposit all moneys as instructed to do by the General Executive
Board in some solvent bank, or banks, which shall be drawn out
only to pay indebtedness arising out of the due conducting of the
business of the Organization, and then, only after bill shall
have been first duly presented by the creditor when, in payment
thereof, a check shall be drawn and signed by him, after which he
shall present it, together with the bill, to the President for
his counter signature.</p>
<p>For the honest and faithful discharge of his duties he shall
give a bond in such sum, or sums, as may be fixed by the
Convention or General Executive Board, the bond so given to be
approved by the General Executive Board and kept in their
custody.</p>
<p>He shall devote his entire time to the affairs of the
Organization and shall at all times be under the supervision of
the General President and the Executive Board and shall receive
for his services such remuneration as may be fixed by the
Convention or the General Executive Board, which shall be paid
out of the funds of the Organization in the same manner as is
provided for in the payment of other bills and indebtedness.</p>
<p>He shall, with the approval of the General Executive Board,
employ such assistance as is necessary to conduct the affairs of
his office. Remuneration for such employes shall be fixed by the
General Executive Board and paid as other bills and indebtedness,
as hereinbefore provided for; he shall convene the General
Executive Board as hereinafter provided for in Article II,
Section 5.</p>
<p>DEL. GILLHAUS: I move that that be adopted as read.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I did not see any provision made in this section
for the protection of the President as is provided for in the
previous clause for the protection of the Secretary-Treasurer;
that is, in regard to honesty, etc. I don&rsquo;t see anything
there where the Secretary is authorized to prefer charges in that
section.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: You will find that provided for in the
next section.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I wanted to speak to the motion which preceded
this motion. I want to explain the thing on the record because
there is something that has been suggested here that I know I
will get up against in the future, and I want, when I go home to
the organization of men whom I represent here, to have them
understand that I tried to get the floor of this convention when
this question of salaries of officers came up here. I do not
think that I will stand for any $2,000 parasite in this union,
and when that does come up on the floor of this organization I
shall insist and say that if any man doing the work of the
working class will get $2,000 a year, I will get out of this
organization. I am working for about $8 a week. I want to go on
record.</p>
<p>DEL. J. C. SULLIVAN: I would like to state for the benefit of
all of the delegates in this convention that if you will notice
the reading of that constitution pertaining to remuneration or
salary it provides that that shall be fixed by the convention.
Now, your committee did not feel competent to insert figures
there; consequently, they referred the matter to the convention.
I would hold that it is the duty of each and every delegate here
that is interested, when the proper time comes, to express their
opinion and offer a resolution or a motion covering the matter.
You are not fixing a salary at this time by adopting that part
referring to the salary; you are simply giving yourselves as a
convention power to do so.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question is that this section be adopted.
(Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. WILLIAMSON: If Brother Powers had been on the committee
he would have had an individual chance of speaking on the matter
at the time.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Those in favor of adopting the section will
signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried and
the section adopted.</p>
<p>The secretary of the committee read the following section:</p>
<h4>DUTIES OF THE GENERAL EXECUTIVE BOARD.</h4>
<p>Section 5. The General Executive Board shall be composed of
the General President, the General Secretary-Treasurer, and one
member from each International Industrial Union, as provided for
in Article II, Section I. The General President shall be elected
as provided for in Article II, Section 2, except in case of
vacancy, which shall be hereinafter provided for. The General
Secretary-Treasurer shall be elected as provided for in Article
II, Section 2, except in case of vacancy, when he shall be
elected as provided for in Article II, Section 3. The other
members of the General Executive Board shall be elected by their
respective International Industrial Unions, in accordance with
their prescribed rules except in case of a vacancy, when such
vacancy shall be filled as provided for in Article II, Section 3,
all of whom shall hold their office for one year, or until their
successors are duly elected, qualified and installed.</p>
<p>Immediately upon adjournment of each Convention, the General
Executive Board shall convene and designate some one of their
members, other than the Secretary-Treasurer, as President pro
tem., who shall, in case of emergency, assume the duties of
General President until such a time as the General Executive
Board can be convened to fill the vacancy in the office of
President.</p>
<p>Any member of the Executive Board or the Secretary-Treasurer
may, if in their judgment they find the official action of the
President detrimental to the best interests of the Organization,
file a complaint in writing, setting forth such charges. If said
complaint is signed by two or more members of the Executive
Board, it shall be filed with the General Secretary-Treasurer,
who shall, within ten (10) days after serving a copy of such
charges on the President, convene the General Executive Board, to
hear the case. If the charges are sustained by a majority vote of
the General Executive Board, they may suspend or expel the
General President from his office, provided that, before the
suspension or expulsion of the President be permanent, the
question shall be submitted to the entire membership of the
organization and their decision thereon shall be binding and
final.</p>
<p>The General Executive Board shall have full power to conduct
the affairs of the Organization between conventions and their
decision on all matters pertaining to the Organization, or any
subordinate part thereof, shall be binding, subject to an appeal
to the next convention, or to the entire membership of the
Organization, provided that, in case a referendum vote of the
membership is demanded by any subordinate, or sub-division, part
of the Organization, the expense of submitting the matter to
referendum shall be borne by the Organization taking the appeal,
except wherein the decision of the General Executive Board shall
be reversed by a vote of the membership; then the expense shall
be borne by the general organization.</p>
<p>The General Executive Board shall have full power to issue
charters to International Industrial Unions, Industrial Councils
and Local Unions, as provided for in Article I, Section 2 (a), 2
(b) and 2 (c). They shall also have power to charter and classify
unions, or organizations, not herein provided for.</p>
<p>In case the members of any subordinate organization of the
INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD are involved in strike, regularly
ordered by the Organization, or General Executive Board, or
involved in a lockout, if in the opinion of the President and
General Executive Board it becomes necessary to call out any
other union, or unions, or organization, they shall have full
power to do so.</p>
<p>Any agreement entered into between the members of any Local
Union, or organization, and their employers, as a final
settlement of any difficulty or trouble which may occur between
them, shall not be considered valid or binding until the same
shall have the approval of the General Executive Board of the
INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD.</p>
<p>The General Executive Board shall meet twice within a fiscal
year to audit the books of the General Secretary-Treasurer and
transact such other business as may come before them.</p>
<p>The General Executive Board shall, by a two-thirds vote, have
power to levy a special assessment when subordinate parts of the
organization are involved in strikes and the condition of the
treasury makes such action necessary, but no special assessment
shall exceed fifty cents per member in any one month, nor more
than six (6) such assessments in any one year, unless the same
shall have been approved by a referendum vote of the entire
membership; provided that, in case special assessment be levied,
the same shall be paid from the treasury of the Local Unions and
International Industrial Unions chartered by the INDUSTRIAL
WORKERS OF THE WORLD, and provided that, when special assessments
are levied for the benefit of unions or organizations, the
members directly involved in strike shall be exempt from such
assessment.</p>
<p>The General Executive Board shall have full power and
authority over the official organ and guide its policy. They
shall, by a majority vote, elect an Editor, who shall receive
such compensation as in the judgment of the General Executive
Board is just and proper.</p>
<p>The Editor shall hold his office at the pleasure of the
General Executive Board and shall at all times recognize the
authority of the General Executive Board over him as Editor of
the official organ. The Editor may, with the approval of the
General Executive Board, employ such help as is necessary to
conduct the affairs of his office.</p>
<p>DEL. CRANSTON: I would like to have this added to that: I move
that this be added as an amendment to that: &ldquo;All members of
the General Executive Board shall, before assuming the duties of
their office, fill out and sign in the presence of witnesses
their resignations, the same to take effect on acceptance by a
majority of the General Executive Board, subject to the rights of
appeal as provided.&rdquo; (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
the section be amended as read. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>DEL. WHITE: A delegate raises the question whether it would
require a vote of this convention, that no general officer or
President of the Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the
World shall hold membership in the American Federation of Labor,
or any other pure and simple trades and labor organization.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Comrade White, I think that is a matter
for the convention itself to decide. If this is a real, economic,
revolutionary convention the convention might say that, and if it
does not they will go away as a lot of pure and simplers, in my
judgment.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I desire, Mr. Chairman, to appeal to your
recollection as the Chairman of this convention. I want to ask a
question for information. After I had offered an amendment which
was intended to cover the ground in that document called a
constitution, you said that it should not be the permanent
constitution. I believe that was your declaration, wasn&rsquo;t
it, or was it not?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I said that in my opinion this was merely a
provisional constitution.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Yes. Now, sir, I want to ask you if, when this
convention adjourns, that constitution being adopted by this
convention, the Western Federation of Miners, the S. T. &amp; L.
A. and the others who come in, if they won&rsquo;t hereafter be
the organization, if adopted by them and all the other
organizations, and I could never have a chance in any other
organization until they have affiliated with that body.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Until they have affiliated with this
organization?</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: Yes. For that reason I want to still offer an
amendment. In Delegate Hagerty&rsquo;s reading there I find, sir,
that provision is made to elect the officers annually, but no
provision made as to how often or how many times they may be
elected.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Yes, there is.</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I want to offer this amendment: That where it says
that he shall he elected for one year (it states that he shall be
elected yearly, but don&rsquo;t say how many times he shall be
elected), I want it to read that it shall be for one year, and no
officer shall be elected more than four consecutive terms, if I
can get a second to that amendment. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there a second to the amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. PAYNE: Yes, I second it.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: The amendment is that officers of this
organization shall be elected for one year and not to be elected
more than four consecutive years. You have heard the amendment.
Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>Question called for, and amendment put and lost.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion now occurs on the section as read.
Are you ready for the question? (Question called for.)</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: Brother Chairman and Fellow Delegates, it was
just this particular point where the difference is between the
contention of Brother Coates and the rest of the delegates, and
there we are now. Now, a man that is a member of an organization
of the American Federation of Labor, he has then, according to
the statements here, no right whatsoever in this
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: No, not at all. You are talking
about&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: In the Manifesto it is stated that members
should be members of national and international organizations.
Now, according to what is read and stated here, we have no right
to be here. Now, then&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Klemensic, permit the Chair to explain
to you that this does not say as to what your membership shall
be. The question was simply asked by Delegate White, but it is
not set forth or defined in any way in that section as read.</p>
<p>DEL. KLEMENSIC: But it is stated here that he shall not be a
member of the American Federation of Labor.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: No, it does not.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No, that is not in here at all.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question before the convention at this time
is whether or not this section shall be adopted. The motion is
that it be adopted as read. Are you ready for the question ?</p>
<p>(Question called for.)</p>
<p>The question was put and carried and the section adopted.</p>
<h4>PERSONAL ANNOUNCEMENT.</h4>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will proceed to read.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I would ask, as special privilege, the ears of
the delegates of this convention for two minutes. I would ask it
as a special privilege, if there is no objection. (No objection
was heard.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Delegate Sherman has the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman, Sisters and Brothers, I have an
announcement to make, and I desire to make a motion following the
announcement. Our little sister here on the platform, Sister
Langdon, who has so efficiently served us through this
convention, had the misfortune yesterday of having some one steal
all her belongings from this platform, including her return
transportation, some $40 or $50, and some valuable credentials
that she had from various organizations in her work that she has
done for many years. I want to make a motion that the Chair
appoint an uninstructed committee to take up this case and make
such provisions as in their judgment will be fitting for the
occasion. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the motion. Are you ready for the
question? (Question called for). Those in favor of the motion
signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried. The
Chair would appoint on that committee, the mover of the motion,
Brother Sherman, Brother McCabe and Brother Hickey. The Secretary
will proceed to read.</p>
<p>DEL. MCCABE: Brother Hickey is not here at the present time. I
don&rsquo;t think he will be here till to-morrow afternoon.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Well, the committee can probably meet with
him.</p>
<h4>CONSTITUTION, RESUMED.</h4>
<p>The Secretary of the Constitution Committee read the next
section as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Article III. Section I. Revenues. The revenue of the
organization shall be derived as follows: Charter fees for
International Industrial Unions shall be $25. Charter fees for
District Councils and Local Unions shall be $10.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. HOPKINS: I move that it be adopted as read.</p>
<p>At the request of Delegate Hall the section was read
again.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I would like to remark that I hope the
fellows that are not listening won&rsquo;t ask any more
questions.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I stand rebuked, but I will explain the reason why
I would like to have that read. I believe here is an opportunity
of knocking out that idea of chartering district councils. Now,
we might provide for district councils without chartering them.
If we charter them we give them special sanction, giving them
certain powers that it is a little difficult to withdraw later
on. Now, I move you that we knock out that part of the article
referring to district charters and in all sections following. I
think there has been nothing preceding this. Let us knock out all
portions that provide for issuing charters to central councils.
This motion simply covers this one case where we receive revenues
from district councils for these charters, and then it will
provide later on for knocking out all that charter proposition to
the central councils. I move you that we knock out that portion
of this section which relates to issuing charters to district
councils. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A point of order. District councils have
already been provided for and adopted by this convention in the
first article of this proposed constitution, in Section I.
Moreover, in Section 4 of that same Article I, which has been
adopted by this convention, jurisdiction is given in these
councils. Now, you cannot have industrial councils composing part
of this Industrial Workers of the World and having jurisdiction
without having charters.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The point of order is well taken.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: Just before you rule on that, will you permit
me&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: I move that the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; in
reference to the price for local charters be stricken out and
&ldquo;three&rdquo; inserted. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion occurs on the original motion, which
is to adopt the section as read. Are you ready for the question?
(Question called for). Those in favor will signify it by saying
aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried and the section adopted
as read.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: Did you understand that I had a second to my
motion?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: I did not.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: This gentleman (indicating) seconded it.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If you will, kindly rise to your feet when you
address the Chair. I did not hear you second it. The Secretary
will proceed.</p>
<p>Secretary Hagerty of the committee read the next section of
Article III, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 2. International Industrial Unions shall pay as
general dues into the treasury of the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE
WORLD the rate of eight and one-third cents per month per member;
Industrial Councils shall pay a flat rate of $1.00 per month for
the organization; Local Unions shall pay twenty-five cents per
member per month, together with such assessments as may be levied
as provided for in Article II, Section 5.</p>
<p>The stamp system shall be used. Stamps shall be procured from
the General Secretary-Treasurer at the rate of prices provided
for in Section 2 of Article III.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard read Section 2 of Article III.
What is the pleasure of the convention?</p>
<p>It was moved and seconded that the section be adopted.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
that section be adopted as read.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I move to amend the section as read by
striking out &ldquo;eight and one-third cents&rdquo; and
substituting &ldquo;twelve and one-half cents.&rdquo; I wish to
speak to the motion if it receives a second. (Amendment
seconded.)</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I move to amend that the &ldquo;eight and
one-third&rdquo; be stricken out and &ldquo;six&rdquo; inserted.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: It has been regularly moved and seconded that
&ldquo;eight and one-third&rdquo; be stricken out and
&ldquo;six&rdquo; inserted. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I probably should have stated my reasons
for making the motion that the general dues be twelve and
one-half cents to the international, but I did not consider it in
order to make such a statement preceding the motion. I consider
that the solidarity of this organization cannot be expressed
except the organization issues a publication at regular intervals
containing the official declarations of the organization and
representing its principles, which publication should go to every
single member of international, national and local unions. It
seems to me that if we are to have solidarity at all, that is to
say, if all of the members of this organization are to act
together, they must think together first; that is to say, they
must decide for themselves, from a study of the principles of the
organization and the conditions affecting the organization, what
action is necessary for the best interests of the organization.
And unless the individual members of all of the unions united
with this proposed organization are in close touch all of the
time with the conditions of all of the other unions in the
organization, they will not know what action can best be taken
for the interests of the organization as a whole. We have not
recognized in to-day&rsquo;s work that a provision of the
Manifesto shall be followed strictly. I will not say that the
recommendation of the Manifesto regarding the issuance of a
universal journal must be strictly followed, because the
precedent has been established that this convention has the right
to place a construction or interpretation upon the Manifesto. But
I do maintain that whether the Manifesto is to be strictly
followed or not, the recommendation for a universal official
journal to go to every member is fundamentally right and ought to
be adopted and provided for in this convention. Maintaining that
it is right, I maintain that the revenues provided for the
general organization will not permit of the publication of such
an official journal and sending it to every member. It will
simply permit of the publication of a journal for voluntary
subscription, and such a journal will receive the subscriptions
of only those who are the best supporters of the organization and
who least need it An official journal for this organization, to
be of any benefit to the members, should be issued weekly; that
is, to be of great benefit to the members. If it is to be issued
weekly it will require at least four cents per member per month
from all of the members united locally or internationally. If
issued monthly it will require at least two and one-half or three
cents per member per month to provide the means for that purpose.
As I understand it, of the eight and one-third cents per capita
tax provided from the international organization, five cents is
to go into a central defense fund. Is that correct?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No, it is not five cents.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: A special defense fund is provided for,
Mr. Chairman, any way. I maintain, anyhow, that the revenue as
provided for here will not permit of properly conducting this
organization and provide means for the publication of an official
journal to go to every member, and I therefore made the motion
for twelve and one-half cents; and while I will not repeat the
motion again, I want to register my objection to reducing that
tax below the amount stated in the committee&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I agree in all that has been stated by Brother
Smith of the necessity and the good that will come from a journal
issued by this General Executive Board, and your Committee on
Constitution took that proposition under advisement, but we felt
at this time that the time will soon pass to arrive at the date
of another convention, and during that time there will be a great
deal of what might be called turmoil work, of getting these
organizations in line, and getting things straightened out.
Recognizing the fact that the organizations that are here pledged
and joined with this organization have at the present time
official organs of their own that must be supported by the
membership, we felt that a year would not be too long for the
rank and file to decide whether they wanted the publication of
one united publication; and they were as a unit believing that it
would be of very little interest to the rank and file to have a
general publication and then all the internationals have a
publication also, and they felt that with this new child that is
being born, if we could organize and pull together the working
class and put them in good working shape so that they would be
prepared to go into the next convention, then if they saw fit to
make provisions to launch an official organ that would embrace
the whole machinery or whole business of the whole organization,
they would be better prepared at that time. Feeling as the
committee did, that it was not the proper time at the beginning
of an organization to launch an official organ, they felt that
the amount named as per capita tax or general dues was
sufficient, and I am of the opinion that the committee is
correct. There are none of the organizations that are coming in
here but what have official organs of their own. Those organs
have got lists of subscribers that are paid for, and those
subscriptions are supposed to be carried out to the expiration of
the time that they have paid for. Hence if they pass a motion as
prescribed by Brother Smith at this time it would necessitate the
double load of carrying the general organ as well as the ones
that they have subscribed to and paid for at this time. Hence I
do not think we are ready at this time to dictate too much of a
load upon the rank and file. Hence I am opposed at this time to
insisting upon launching an official organ for the
organization.</p>
<p>DEL. SHURTLEFF: I desire to offer an amendment to the
amendment, that the tax to the general body shall be fixed at
five cents for the defense fund and one cent for the general
fund. With the sick benefits and other expenses, to turn over
eight and one-third cents to the general organization would
practically put you out of business entirely. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You are out of order. An amendment to the
amendment has been offered, that is, that this section be amended
by striking out &ldquo;eight and one-third&rdquo; and inserting
&ldquo;six.&rdquo; Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>Question called for; also roll call demanded.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair will determine as to whether a roll
call will be had on this question. If this is carried
overwhelmingly there will be no roll call.</p>
<p>DEL. POWERS: Now, comrades, I think we are making a mistake
just here. You are basing the income of this organization
according to your experience. This amendment to the amendment
says six cents per capita. You will understand that this six
cents has got to come out of the dues that are paid into the
organization to carry on the organization. Now, we have only got
one textile local in Rhode Island, and at the present time it is
in a crippled state because it had a big strike on over nine
months, and it was torn literally to pieces financially and
numerically. Now, you want to keep this in mind, you men who get
$3 and $4 a day, that there are in this group of textile workers
men who are working fifty-eight hours for $5.40 a week. There are
in this group women who are working for $3.60 a week-grown women.
And these people want to be organized. There is a greater need
for organizing them than there is you. (Applause.) You are
getting a living wage; you are getting something to eat, and you
have got fresh air. These people do not get a wage sufficient to
feed them properly, and they are in an atmosphere that is
poisoning them ten hours a day. Now, I tell you, we cannot stand
this per capita tax. I tell you further, that you will organize
very few locals in the textile industry if they have to pay $10
for a charter. Now, comrades, I do not want to do any bragging,
but I have organized a few textile industries and I have paid for
the charters out of my own pocket, and it was only $3, but they
could not raise $3. Now, I understand the textile industry. I
know the financial condition of those people, and I tell you that
the best young men, as good as any that I know of, have gone into
a fight against $60,000,000, against the greatest woolen trust,
or the greatest combination of woolen manufacturers in America,
and carried on a strike for nearly nine months; carried it into
four states, and stopped 2,700 looms, and among people whom they
had never seen before, and there are 800 of those people now
blacklisted. In this town, in this local that I come from, we
have 50 men of that local that can&rsquo;t work in that town, and
they are scattered to all points of the compass. Now, I would
like to keep these people together. They are the fighting element
of the textile industry id New England. Outside of this lot of
men there is nothing in New England worth mentioning. Years ago
many of them belonged to the assembly of the Knights of Labor.
Some of them have grown gray in the labor movement. Now, I would
like to have you allow these people to live, allow us to exist,
if you make this per capita tax six cents you will put us out of
business. Now, that is all I am telling you. I would like to see
something done to let these district councils decide what their
dues will be. They are the best judges of what the per capita tax
should be and what they can afford to pay. Mr. Chairman, just
think; we have got in Rhode Island about 100,000 textile workers;
probably over 100,000, and we have got organized in that whole
state, taking those who belong to the American Federation of
Labor and all the rest of them, about 10,000. Now, there is a big
field there, and we want this organization to put us in a
position so that when we get back we can go out and work. We do
not want this organization to put us in a position that will
cripple us financially in the beginning; and this will do it.
Now, we can&rsquo;t pay this per capita tax. I say to you that
the treasury of our organization is empty now; we haven&rsquo;t
got a nickel there. We are holding this organization together
with our hands and teeth. We have been holding it that way for
two years, and I am sure that if this goes on and you force us to
pay six cents after paying all our other expenses, that we will
not be able to do it. Now, that is the condition. I hope this
amendment will pass, the five-cent amendment. I hope the
amendment to the amendment will be struck out. I would rather see
some provision made in the constitution to leave it to those
groups in this textile industry to decide how much dues they will
pay and how much per capita tax they can afford to pay. They are
in a better position to know what they can pay. Now, comrades,
you men here who earn $3 and $4 and $5 a day, if you came into
our industry we would look upon you as a curiosity. You are able
to pay, with $4 and $5 a day. Delegate Morrison surprised me the
other day when he said he was getting $5 a day. I haven&rsquo;t
run into that sort of a man in a year.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I rise to a question of personal privilege to
speak on this question, inasmuch as I was mentioned by the
speaker as being the man who stands on this floor as having
received $5 a day. There is no man in this convention that
realizes&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair will not permit the delegate to go
into the question of wages. This is a question of whether or not
this amendment will be carried.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: Well, I want to speak to the amendment, Mr.
Chairman, but I want to diverge just a moment so as to make
myself understood.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: What is the amendment? I would like to hear the
amendment again.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment to the amendment is that
&ldquo;eight and one-third&rdquo; be stricken out and
&ldquo;five&rdquo; cents per capita inserted. Delegates will
confine themselves to the question.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I am heartily in favor of a reduction from
&ldquo;eight and one-third&rdquo;, or from &ldquo;six&rdquo; down
to &ldquo;five&rdquo;, if there are going to be stipulated sums
prescribed that the different locals are to pay for dues; for the
reason that the delegate here has raised the question of the
impossibility on the part of certain individuals and groups of
laborers in this country to meet their payment. And I rise to a
point of privilege to express myself and go on record in this
convention on a proposition that has never been submitted to this
convention, in regard to the equitable distribution of the
burdens of this great organization that we are going to launch.
May I have this privilege just a minute?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: As long as you are speaking to this
question.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I might divert just a minute, but I want to go
on record on this question.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair will call your attention to it if you
divert.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: All right. This is my proposition, briefly. I
don&rsquo;t want to detain you long because it is not my purpose.
It is this, that there ought to be dues established by this
organization that will bear equally upon each and every
individual member of society known as a laboring individual, in
accordance with his ability, dues based upon a men&rsquo;s
earning capacity. (Applause.) That will provide for my friend who
is working in the mill, sitting over here, and it will also
provide for the man that gets $5 a day, and I promise to pay my
percentage of the dues, whatever it is.</p>
<p>DEL. SAUNDERS: In view of the fact that there is no motion to
the effect of the one on which the last brother spoke, I would be
in favor of the amendment to six cents, taking into consideration
what Brother Powers stated. I believe, however, that working men
who want an organization at all will realize that we cannot
organize under less than six cents and allow the organization to
live. I believe too, that there should be a provision, whereby
these organizations that come in under the head of the category
mentioned by Brother Powers should be provided for, but I do not
believe that that is any argument why the six cents should not
prevail. Therefore I am in favor of the amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: It occurs to me that it is impossible to vote
intelligently upon this proposition unless we understand
something of how this fund is to be segregated. It is just
possible that the suggestion of twelve and one-half cents would
not be too much if we knew how the money was to be used; or it is
just possible that we might make it a little more than that if
used in the proper way. Now, let me suggest to you that the
constitution provides that each industrial section or division
shall have a member on the General Executive Board. It also
provides that these separate divisions shall have a general
Secretary-Treasurer. Now, I would like to have it go out to the
world that this member of the General Executive Board and this
General Secretary-Treasurer of the industrial division is linked
in his personal interest with this one union that we are forming.
Now, if the salaries of the different international officers are
to be paid from this general fund accumulated in the treasury by
this per capita tax, and the cost of stationery and supplies by
the different internationals, and the rent of their office is to
be paid from this general per capita tax that is under
discussion, it might reasonably be a little larger than it is or
that has been suggested, and have no international per capita
tax. For instance, if all the per capita tax assessed against the
membership of the organization should go into one central
treasury from which could be borne the expense of all the
different industrial divisions, then that is all the per capita
tax that is necessary to put upon the membership, and we could
make it much lighter that way than by a per capita tax placed on
them for the support of this main organization of eight and a
half or six cents, and then have another per capita tax on them
for the support of their separate industrial division. Now, if we
knew how these funds were to be segregated, then we could vote
intelligently, but until we do I do not see how we can treat the
question wisely and well. I am in favor of one per capita tax and
no more, and I am in favor of that coming into a general
treasury, and I am in favor of the secretaries of these different
industrial organizations representing industrial divisions being
paid out of that. I am in favor of having a uniform system of
stationery and supplies going out to the membership.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The chair will have to call you to order.
Inasmuch as the section that was adopted there says that the
financial and administrative powers shall go to the divisions,
you are not speaking to the question.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I rather think that you misunderstood what I wanted
to say.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have talked a long while, long enough to
make anybody understand.</p>
<p>DEL. HALL: I believe that different delegates have stated that
the per capita tax would be sufficient to bear the expense that I
have suggested; that is, the salaries and the general
administration of these different industrial divisions. Now, the
committee has made no suggestion as to the segregation of this
fund coming in. If the per capita tax is eight and one-third
cents it means $80 per thousand members. That, multiplied by
50,000 members represented in this convention, means 50 times 80,
which is $4000, I think, per month. Now, I believe that is more
than is necessary to pay the salaries of General President and
General Secretary-Treasurer and to get out the stationery
necessary to conduct the business of the general organization. I
think it is an unnecessary burden to place upon the membership.
Now, if the committee would define what uses they wish to make of
that money that comes in, then we could act upon it
intelligently.</p>
<p>DEL. LUCY E. PARSONS: I think this per capita tax is very
important. We have heard from this delegate from Rhode Island
that there are women there working for $3.60 a week, and
certainly they have got to be taken into consideration. I can
verify this, for I was in Rhode Island and among those textile
workers, and I think that their wages would not enable them to
pay a very large tax. They are the class we want. This
organization is for the purpose of helping all, and certainly it
is the women in the textile mills that are the lowest paid. I
think the suggestion of the brother here is good, if it can be
made flexible and work; that the different local organizations
should be permitted to levy their own tax, knowing as they do
what amount that tax should be. If it is a local in the west or
in Chicago, where the wages are better, they may be able to vote
a larger per capita tax. There should be more flexibility so as
to meet the conditions of those who only get $3 or $4 a week, and
not make their tax at the same ratio as those who get as much as
that a day, or even more. Simply make it so that the People and
the women who get such poor pay should not be assessed as much as
the men who get higher pay.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: I wish to ask the committee through you, Mr.
Chairman, a question.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You may proceed.</p>
<p>DEL. DINGER: Is there any provision made in the constitution
there for such cases as presented here by Comrade Powers?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: I think that that is the spirit of this
constitution. As the Chairman stated a while ago, the
constitution is provisional for the sake of getting this
organization under way, and I think&mdash;I am
positive&mdash;that there is not a single member of that
Constitution Committee who would dream of compelling a textile
worker earning $3 a week to pay into the general fund that which
he could not pay. I think that that is the spirit of the
Constitution Committee. That was discussed, in reference to the
earnings of members, for instance the miners; that the eight and
one-third cents a month is a mere bagatelle to the miner. As a
matter of fact, that provision could not be enforced in so far as
the textile workers are concerned, or in so far, for instance, as
the closing down of the mills. Suppose the mills would close down
for a year and they were not earning anything at all, if they
were paying eight and one-third cents a month into the general
fund it would destroy their organization. I do not think that
that is the spirit of this constitution at all, and if I am not
right in saying that, I would like some other members of the
Constitution Committee to correct me here. I think that the
convention has got Brother Sherman&rsquo;s interpretation of that
Constitution Committee, that it is not an iron-clad document,
fixed and rigid like the old bed of Procrustes, who, when a
traveler came along, would put him on a bed, and if his legs were
too short he would stretch them, and if the legs were too long he
would chop them off. This is not procrustean; it is a document or
constitution to give us a working plan to go on, and it must be
left to wisdom and experience to guide us. There is enough power
given to the wisdom of the General Executive Board to cover the
objection of Brother Powers. We all recognize that that is a
real, solid objection, and I think that the General Executive
Board of the incoming organization has power to regulate such a
matter as that. Otherwise there is no use having a General
Executive Board if they cannot interpret the spirit of this
constitution; and the spirit of it, the keynote of the spirit, is
struck in its Preamble.</p>
<p>DE1. MILLER: The pathetic helplessness of poverty was never
better suggested than by Comrade Powers when he stated the
condition of the textile workers in Rhode Island. It ought to be
clear to the delegates of this convention that if anybody were in
the same condition as those textile workers, resistance to
capitalism would be out of the question. It is clear, too, that
if the textile workers are not able to pay, the men who are
receiving better wages than they are getting might bear the
burden of that fight for labor. There is nothing to hinder the
Executive Board from granting a dispensation to, even like the
textile workers and other crafts in which extremely low wages
prevail, and the burden might be laid on the shoulders of those
fellows who not only have the power to do, but have the will as
well. No one need be afraid of what is going to become of $4000
that may come into the treasury of this organization. Any one who
knows or has the faintest conception of the burdens which this
organization is to meet, knows that funds will constitute a grave
question. We cannot have too much money. For that reason it seems
to me that both the amendment to raise to twelve and one-half
cents (as I do not think it is wise to provide at the present
time for the publication of an official journal) should fail, and
the one reducing the per capita tax to six cents should fail
also. That is about the size of it.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I would only mention what Delegate Hagerty
said. It seems to me that this convention is trying to make an
organization so perfect that you will never have to go into any
other convention. If you think you can do that, then you might
just as well make up your minds that you will have no
constitution for the next three years to come.</p>
<p>DEL. LILLIAN FORBERG: Thee brother is not talking on the
subject.</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I am sticking to the subject pretty close. I
think you will have something to do and change in the next
convention. I think the per capita tax of the amendment to the
amendment is just about the one we should adopt. It is easy to
increase expenses, but it is hard to decrease them. At the next
convention, if you think that you need to increase your per
capita tax you can do so, after you have seen that it is
necessary. The comrade here has described the condition in Rhode
Island. You can leave those states out and exempt them from
bearing the per capita tax at all, according to the Manifesto
there. How can they build up the organization? Their hands and
teeth are the only instruments that they have. Since 1881 the
carpenters have had a convention every other year, and there
never was a year that they had a convention unless they had to
change their constitution either one way or the other, taking
out, changing, etc.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: I want to ask Delegate Hagerty if the
constitution makes provision for the General Executive Board in
such cases as this one; if it has given the General Executive
Board that power?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: I do not know exactly the wording here, but the
General Executive Board has power to regulate the affairs of the
organization between conventions; that is what it states. If we
are going to give that an interpretation there, it must be broad
enough to cover these difficulties.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: It does specifically give them the power, does
it?</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: May I read that portion to them?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: In the &ldquo;Duties of the General Executive
Board&rdquo; it is said that the Executive Board shall have full
power to conduct the affairs of the organization between
conventions, subject, of course, to a referendum.</p>
<p>DEL. MCDONALD: Surely, yes, subject to the constitution.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The question is on the amendment to the
amendment, which is to insert the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;eight and one-third.&rdquo; Those who favor the motion
will say aye. Contrary no. The motion is lost. The motion now
occurs on the amendment to the original motion, which is to make
the per capita tax twelve and one-half cents. Those in favor of
the motion will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The motion
is lost. The motion now occurs on the original motion, which is
to adopt the section as read. Those in favor will signify it by
saying aye. Contrary no. The motion is carried and the section
adopted. The Secretary will proceed.</p>
<h4>INDUSTRIAL MEMBERS, INITIATION FEES AND DUES.</h4>
<p>The Secretary of the committee read the next section, as
follows:</p>
<p>Article III. Section 3. Individual members may be admitted to
membership at large in the organization as provided in Article I,
Section 2, paragraph D, on payment of $2 initiation fee and 50
cents per month dues, together with such assessments as may be
levied by the Executive Board as provided for in Section 5,
Article II, all of which shall be paid to the General
Secretary-Treasurer; provided, members at large shall remain such
so long as they are outside of the jurisdiction of a local union
subordinate to the general organization, but on moving within the
jurisdiction of a local union of the Industrial Workers of the
World or any of its subordinate organizations they shall transfer
their membership from the union at large to the local union
within the jurisdiction where they are employed. The initiation
fee for members of local unions, as provided for in Section 2,
paragraph C, Article I, and Sections 5, Article II, shall be $2.
The monthly dues shall he 50 cents per month, together with such
assessments as may be levied as provided for in Section 5,
Article II; provided, no part of the initiation fee or dues above
mentioned shall be used as sick or death benefits, but shall be
held in the treasury as a general fund to defray the legitimate
expenses of the union. All international industrial unions
subordinate to the Industrial Workers of the World shall charge
for initiation fee in their respective unions not less than $1.50
nor more than $5 as in their judgment the conditions will
justify. All international industrial unions subordinate to the
Industrial Workers of the World shall collect from their
membership of their organizations a per capita tax at the rate of
25 cents a member per month; provided, that no part of the above
mentioned moneys shall be used for sick, accident or death fund,
but shall be held in the treasury of the international industrial
unions for the purpose of paying the legitimate expenses of
maintaining the organizations.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I make a motion that we concur in the
recommendation of the committee. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the motion. Are you ready for the
question?</p>
<p>DEL. ROSS: I want to say to this convention that I want to
move that Delegate Hagerty completely read the remaining portion
of that constitution, and then we will adopt it as a whole
without debate. Now, I have got a reason for this. There have
been some of us going away, and they know it will be adopted. I
am cognizant of the fact, and every one on this floor ought to be
so by this time, that it is useless to change or make a request
or a motion. I move that Delegate Hagerty continue to read the
remaining portion of the constitution as provided by the
Constitution Committee, and when it has been read that this
convention adopt it as a whole and without debate.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is out of order. The motion is to
adopt the section. Are you ready for the question?</p>
<p>Question called for.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I rise to ask a question. I made a motion to
concur, to bring it before the house. In that section that has
just been read there is a passage that refers to the national
industrial organizations charging an initiation fee of $1.50 and
not more than $5. Do I understand that to refer to the local or
to the individual members?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: That is the local.</p>
<p>DEL. WILKE: I didn&rsquo;t get quite clear on that, and I
wanted to ask the question.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: I would like to know if I have been
mistaken in understanding that the report of the committee
provides that the dues in the local unions, including local
unions with international bodies, shall be 50 cents per month.
Will the Chairman permit the Secretary of the committee to answer
that question?</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: Local unions (and by &ldquo;local
unions&rdquo; in this section is meant unions that are directly
chartered by the general administration of the Industrial Workers
of the World), in places where there are not enough persons in an
industry to constitute an industrial organization, shall pay 25
cents per month per member.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: That is not the question.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Individual members shall pay 50 cents per month.
Your question is&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: My question is whether this constitution as
reported by the committee provides the rate of dues to be paid by
members of local unions.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: It does not. That means local unions, but
Delegate Smith used local unions in the first sense of the word;
that is, locals directly chartered by the general
administration.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: Or locals with the international.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Or locals united with the international. There
are two. Locals united with internationals have no specified dues
here except as regards their dues to their internationals, not as
locals.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: Is there a minimum and a maximum fee?</p>
<p>fee.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: There is a minimum and a maximum initiation
fee.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will please read the whole
section.</p>
<p>The section was again read by Secretary Hagerty.</p>
<p>DEL. CLARENCE SMITH: Mr. Chairman, if the Secretary will let
me take that I will give it back (copy of report handed to
Delegate Smith.) This is a very long section. It seems to me that
this section provides that dues in local unions directly
chartered by this organization shall be a fixed sum per month,
and yet it does not make any such provision for locals united
with international industrial organizations. Am I right in
that?</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: According to the reading, but it was not the
intention, for I am confident it was the intention to make a
minimum and maximum that the international should charge.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: I will simply treat the report of the committee as
it is written. It is stated that it was the intention of the
Constitution Committee to make the dues in local unions, whether
united directly or through international unions, 50 cents per
month, no more and no less. It is also provided that no part of
the revenue of the local unions, whether directly chartered or
through international organizations, shall be used for sick or
death benefit purposes. In other words, it is proposed in this
constitution to prohibit local unions connected directly with
this organization charging more than 50 cents per month dues.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: A point of order, Mr. Chairman. It is not
prohibited, if the brother will permit me. The local union has
its own constitution and its own local government, financial as
well as administrative, subject to the Industrial Workers of the
World and the approval of the General Executive Board; and that
has already been adopted by this convention.</p>
<p>DEL SMITH: I merely want to understand it properly. If there
is no excuse for me to talk, I am the last man in the convention
to wish to talk. I understand it differently than as stated by
Delegate Hagerty. The initiation fee for members of local unions,
as provided for in Article I, Section 2, and Article 2, Section
5, shall be $2. The monthly dues shall be 50 cents per month. My
interpretation of this section as written and as read is that
local unions of this proposed organization, if this constitution
is adopted, shall charge 50 cents per month dues, no more and no
less. If that is not the intention of the Constitution Committee,
then the constitution Committee has not written the constitution
in accordance with the intention of the committee, and it ought
to be so written. I will speak on the motion to adopt, I am
opposed to that section as read, because I believe that local
unions united with this organization should have the right to fix
the monthly dues of members at any sum the local unions may see
fit. I recognize, Mr. Chairman and Delegates, in making this
talk, that it is entirely out of order if the constitution is to
be written in conformity with the intention of the Constitution
Committee as stated by Delegate Hagerty.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: A point of order. As I stated, that is in this
document already provided for and adopted by this convention. If
you will refer back to the section. It is not my interpretation
or opinion; it is merely the document.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: I simply read the document as it is.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: Read the other part.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: If any other part conflicts with this part of the
constitution, then the other part of the constitution or this
part of the constitution should be and must be changed. This part
of the constitution states clearly that the dues in local unions
shall be 50 cents per month, and it seems to me, Mr. Chairman,
with a further reading of this particular section, that it is the
deliberate intention of the Constitution Committee to prohibit
monthly dues being fixed at a higher rate than 50 cents per
month, because this section goes on to state further along that
no part of the initiation fee or monthly dues shall be used for
sick or death benefit purposes. In order that this part of the
constitution may be in agreement with the intention of the
Constitution Committee, I shall move you that this section which
I now proceed to read as I would amend it, be amended so that it
will fix a minimum dues in local unions of 50 cents per member
per month, and shall eliminate that part of the section
prohibiting local unions from inaugurating sick or death benefit
systems. I shall make that as a motion before I get through. Now,
Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that this organization is going to
succeed as a labor organization just insomuch as it leaves
within, the power of an individual member, just insomuch as it
leaves within the power of the international industrial
organization, a complete and perfect democratic management of the
affairs of the individual member, of the local union and of the
international industrial organization, matters that affect the
individual member only, that affect the local union only, and
that affect the international industrial organization only. If
this organization presumes now or at any other time to say to the
individual member or to the local union or the international
organization that they shall not do things which do not interfere
with the efficiency of the general labor movement as a whole,
then this convention and the organization are going to fix such
rules as will make it absolutely impossible for the organization
to grow or gain strength among the American working people. Local
unions now have a habit in the American Labor Union, in the
Western Federation of Miners and in other local organizations
that are represented in this convention directly or through
international delegations, &mdash;they have a habit and a
practice of charging monthly dues of from 35 cents per month to
$2.50 per month. The monthly dues in some of the local unions of
the Western Federation of Miners are as high as $2.50 and the
benefits are correspondingly great. The monthly dues in some of
the local unions of the American Labor Union are as low as 35
cents per month, and my experience with those organizations has
been that the monthly dues are not sufficient to furnish revenue
to properly conduct the unions and pay the obligations of the
local unions to the general labor movement. I am therefore in
favor of fixing the minimum local dues of 50 cents per member per
month. But, Mr. Chairman, if this convention goes on record as
prohibiting local unions, either national or directly chartered
local organizations, from charging more than 50 cents per member
per month as monthly dues, or prohibit those organizations from
providing benefits for their members as they may see fit after
they have fulfilled all their obligations to the general labor
movement, then it is going to place such restrictions upon this
organization as will make it impossible to succeed. I move you,
Mr. President and brother delegates, as an amendment to this
section&mdash;I shall have to have the document before me in
order to make an intelligent motion&mdash;</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: All right. (Hands constitution to Delegate
Smith).</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH:&mdash;As an amendment to this section&mdash;this
is the section that I would like to amend at this time; I will
read the section as reported by the Committee on Constitution. It
is a paragraph, but in my judgment it should be a section, to be
treated intelligently by the convention:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The initiation fee for members of local unions as
provided for in Article I, Section 2, C, and Article II, Section
5, shall be $2. The monthly dues shall be 50 cents per month,
together with such assessments as may be levied as provided for
in Article II, Section 5; provided no part of the initiation fee
or dues above mentioned shall be used as a sick or death benefit,
but shall be held in the treasury as a general fund to defray the
legitimate expenses of the unions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I move to amend this section so that it shall read as follows.
I will reduce this to writing as soon as I can:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The initiation fee for members of local unions as
provided for in Article I, Section 2, and Article II, Section 5,
shall be not less than $2. The monthly dues shall be not less
than 50 cents per month, together with such assessments as may be
levied as provided for in Article II, Section 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I move as a part of my motion that the balance of the section
be stricken out, which provides that &ldquo;no part of the
initiation fee or dues above mentioned shall be used as a sick or
death benefit, but shall be held in the treasury,&rdquo; etc.
(Seconded.)</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The delegate will please reduce the motion to
writing.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: Have I got the floor?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: If you wish to speak to the motion as made you
have the floor.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I wish to state that I am opposed to the amendment
and am opposed to the adoption of this section. If I go home to
the members of the organization that sent me here, the members
that have been accustomed for the last ten years that the
organization has been in existence never to pay any more than 25
cents dues and not to charge more than $1 initiation fee&mdash;if
I go home to them with that proposition as offered in this
constitution, it will raise a suspicion in their minds that this
will be a bleeding process, and if the money is to be used as it
is specifically stated, for nothing else but to defray the
expenses of the organizations, it will raise a suspicion in the
minds of the members that the purpose of this organization is to
create some soft places for a few individuals. We are opposed at
all times to high dues and high initiation fees. If you wish to
create a defense fund, create a defense fund specifically and
apart from your regular dues. Don&rsquo;t mix them up with
regular dues or any other fund that you wish to create. If I go
to those members of that organization with this proposition they
will jump red-hot at me, I will tell you. And another thing; if
you send out organizers to organize the men that earn probably
between. $5 and $10 a week, and you ask those men to &ldquo;Come
to a meeting to be organized, but don&rsquo;t forget the
$2&rdquo;, you will get very few that will come there. I have had
experience. I have simply asked the men to come and be prepared
to pay but 25 cents initiation fee, and I did not get many. I
will guarantee that if you ask men earning between $5 and $10 or
less, to come with $2 in their pockets to pony up for initiation
fee, you won&rsquo;t get many.</p>
<p>DEL. T. J. HAGERTY: A point of information. In the
constitution it is not said that new unions that come into this
have to pay $2, but it specifies a charter fee of $10 for the new
unions.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman and Brothers, your committee when
drawing up this constitution, this one part, realized, that in
the past it has been the habit of some trades organizations of
having low dues and then inaugurating a sick benefit, and then
when a grievance came up and it required a little finance to
carry on a little local business or to send somebody from their
union to help them and pay their day&rsquo;s wages, when they
have looked in their treasury they have found that it had all
been paid out for sick benefits and they did not have anything.
Now, an army without a commissary train is worth nothing in the
field. If you have got nothing behind you but an organization
with an empty treasury it isn&rsquo;t worth a cent. You have got
to feed the soldier if you expect him to go on the firing line
and fight. The only desertions that we generally hear of are
where they have been starved to death. Hence we felt that we must
provide for local dues and then specify that those dues should be
used for the legal expenses of the organizations, which any one
realizes is anything pertaining to strikes, grievances, lockouts
or the current expenses of the organization, but not to be used
for sick, accident or death benefits.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother Sherman, will you permit the chair to
ask you a question?</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Is there any provision in this section of the
constitution that prohibits a local union from having higher dues
and using that portion of the increase?</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: That is what I want to know.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: If a local union desires, among its membership,
a fund created for either death, sick or accident benefit, or for
supporting and maintaining visiting committees, there is nothing
in this constitution that prohibits them from doing that as a
side issue and keeping a separate treasury for that purpose.
There is nothing that prohibits them from doing that. We pay as
an initiation fee, as I understand it&mdash;and I believe Brother
Sullivan will bear me out&mdash;in the international&mdash;if I
remember right it reads that the internationals, local unions
connected with internationals, shall have a minimum local dues of
50 cents and a maximum of not over $1.25. Am I right, Brother
Sullivan, in $1.25.</p>
<p>DEL. SULLIVAN: I don&rsquo;t remember whether we fixed
that.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I think I distinctly remember that we passed
upon this, but we passed upon this before it was written, that
part of it, I mean, and it was written in pencil in longhand. I
am confident, because we discussed the proposition, and we fully
realized that we cannot maintain an organization and have no
blood or ribs or sinews or anything to carry on warfare for less
than 50 cents. Hence I see in Brother Smith&rsquo;s motion a
great harm that might come by allowing them to charge more if
they wished. Now, there are local unions in this country not
affiliated with the American Labor Union, or the Western
Federation of Miners, whose initiation fee is $50.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: $500.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: That is to keep out a certain class that would
come into the field; it will keep them out of the local unions,
because if too many join the organization they will have a
membership so high that all cannot get employment.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: A point of order. I would like to have Brother
Smith&rsquo;s reading, because I think Brother Sherman is not
getting it right on that point.</p>
<p>DEL. SHERMAN: I don&rsquo;t want to do him any wrong.</p>
<p>DEL. SMITH: It seems to me that I have given the constitution
as read the only interpretation that could be given to it by a
literal reading of the constitution. I have been informed by the
Constitution Committee, and I take it for granted that it is the
intention of the constitution, that local unions that wish to
provide further benefits may ask their members and require their
members to pay not more than the difference over the 50 cents per
month. That being the case, I will withdraw my motion, with the
consent of my second. I think, however, that the constitution is
not at all clear on that proposition. I think the constitution is
clear in another part, but I say that a constitution which says
that monthly dues shall be 50 cents per month leaves the
impression upon me, at least, that the dues shall not be more nor
less than 50 cents per month. I believe now that it is not the
intention of the Constitution to be written in that way that the
local unions that wish sick benefits may provide for them, by
paying a higher rate of dues. And with the consent of my second I
will withdraw my motion, with the distinct understanding that the
case is as I have stated.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Does the second withdraw his second?</p>
<p>DEL. JORGENSEN: I withdraw my second.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The motion is withdrawn, and the motion now
occurs upon the section as read.</p>
<p>DEL. FRENCH: I would like to ask as a question of information
if it is not to be understood by that section that local unions
or any unions connected with this Industrial Workers of the
World&mdash;if it be understood that they are not permitted to
form sick and death benefit organizations as a part of the
unions; if they may have them as a wheel within a wheel; as an
organization that the members can form themselves into if they
want to, but not as a part of the organization, as in some of the
old unions now.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair will state that it is the sense of the
Chairman that it is not the intention to prohibit local unions
from establishing sick and death benefits in the unions.</p>
<p>A DELEGATE: In the reading I do not remember whether that
applies to the internationals or whether it is the local unions
connected with the internationals, that the initiation fee shall
be no less and no more than that amount.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: No less than $1.50 nor more than $5.</p>
<p>THE DELEGATE: In some of our unions there is a $2 and $5
proposition.</p>
<p>DEL. VEAL: That has reference to members at large.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: I would like to know, for information, if it is
not in violation of this, that is, does it not put the individual
who transfers from one to another in a position to have to pay an
initiation fee when he transfers from one to the other, inasmuch
as the fees are different perhaps, the one in which he had paid
might be $1.50 and the other might be $2.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The constitution provides for a general
interchange of cards.</p>
<p>DEL. MORRISON: Without any additional fees?</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: I wish to ask a question of the Secretary of the
committee. I have expected it to be brought out. That is, if
locals that are already organized will be required to again pay
an initiatory fee of $2.</p>
<p>DEL. HAGERTY: There are no organized locals. The Industrial
Workers is not yet organized.</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Well, then, I will have to explain my particular
position.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Permit the Chair to answer, will you?</p>
<p>DEL. DAVIS: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Organizations now organized will not have to pay
another initiation fee.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I wish you would read my amendment.</p>
<p>DEL. SAMUEL: This convention has been called to organize the
workingmen; not a trade union; not to keep up, like the American
Federation, the capitalist system. Therefore, we have got to use
them to overthrow it. We know that money will not overthrow the
miserable system, but we have got to make conditions to organize
the unorganized labor. Therefore, we should see what is the
reason those workingmen do not come into these unions. I object
to the initiation fees and dues as stated in that section. I
think there ought to be some way that we could adopt right here
in this convention to make it easy for everybody to come in.</p>
<p>DEL. MCCABE: I rise to a point of order. Delegate Schatzke has
an amendment that has been up there for some time that we would
like to hear.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Brother McCabe, your point of order is not well
taken. Brother Samuel has the floor.</p>
<p>Delegate Samuel yielded the floor.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now, brother, the Secretary will read the
amendment of Brother Schatzke.</p>
<p>The Secretary read the amendment, as follows: &ldquo;All those
people who have no trade or get less than $9 a week shall pay
only twenty-five cents initiation and twenty-five cents dues to
the international organization for the year, with the
understanding of voluntary contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Does Brother Schatzke offer this as an
amendment?</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: Yes.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: To what portion of the section? To the entire
section ?</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: No, only the international or general dues.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: You have heard the amendment. Are you ready for
the question? (Question called for). All those in favor of the
amendment will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The
amendment is lost.</p>
<p>Original question called for.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Now the motion occurs on the section as read.
Those in favor will signify it by saying aye. Contrary no. The
motion is carried and the section adopted. The Secretary will
proceed to read.</p>
<p>DEL. SCHATZKE: I desire that my amendment shall go on
record.</p>
<p>DEL. KIEHN: I wish to be recorded as voting no on the
motion.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: Record the delegate as voting no.</p>
<p>DEL. H. S. DAVIS: I wish to be recorded as voting no.</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will proceed.</p>
<h4>ANNUAL CONVENTIONS.</h4>
<p>Secretary Hagerty, of the committee, read the next section, as
follows: &ldquo;Article IV, Section I. The annual convention of
the Industrial Workers of the World shall be held on the first
Monday in May of each year, at such place as may be determined by
previous convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. FERBER: I move its adoption. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried, and the section declared
adopted.</p>
<h4>DELEGATES TO CONVENTION.</h4>
<p>The next section was read, as follows: &ldquo;Section 2.
Delegates to the annual or special conventions shall be as
hereinafter provided for. The General President, the General
Secretary-Treasurer and other members of the General Executive
Board shall be delegates at large, with one vote each, but shall
not be accredited delegates or carry the vote of any union or
organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEL. FITZGERALD: I move its adoption. (Seconded.)</p>
<p>The motion was put and carried, and the section declared
adopted.</p>
<p>The convention then, at six o&rsquo;clock, adjourned until
nine o&rsquo;clock A. M: July 7.</p>
