<a name="one"></a>Frequently Asked Questions
</p>
<p>
<b><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#1: What is the
IWW?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
It is a fighting labor union that believes that the
interests of labor can be fully served only when working
people are united as a class. It wants to see all on the
same job united, all in the same industry in one union, all
who work for wages in one big union.
</p>
<p>
The IWW differs sharply from the position of other unions
in that, we believe the problems of the working class can
not be solved by begging crumbs from employers or praying
to politicians for favors. While it fights for better
conditions today, the IWW insists that working people are
entitled to everything they produce, instead of a meager
share.
</p>
<p>
There will be insecurity and hunger among those who toil
for as long as there is an employing class that benefits
from low wages and evil working conditions. The IWW holds
that there can be no solution to industrial warfare, no end
to injustice and want, until the profit system itself is
abolished.
</p>
<p>
In striving to unite labor as a class in one big union the
IWW also seeks to build the structure of a new and better
social order within the shell of the old system which fails
to provide for the needs of all.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="two"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#2: Who May Join?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Any wage earner may carry an IWW card. No worker is barred
because of race, religion, nationality, sex, or sexual
orientation.
</p>
<p>
It is not, however, an organization for scissor-bills, for
cowards, for those who substitute words for action. It does
not want people who are content to unquestioningly follow
leaders.
</p>
<p>
The IWW is a union devised by and for workers, the best and
most intelligent, and growing numbers of such workers are
securing IWW cards. They want to help build the union that
will rebuild the world. The IWW needs them and they need
the IWW.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="three"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#3: Can Members of Other
Unions Join the IWW?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Many IWW members are also members of other unions.
They are women and men who form the fighting heart of such
unions; rank and filers who strive to make their unions
yield returns for the membership and not completely
degenerate into docile pacifiers serving the boss.
</p>
<p>
Such workers have joined the IWW because they want to build
a union stronger, more fearless, more honest, than the
unions dominant today. Such a union must, in the end, match
the unity of the employers with the greater unity of the
workers, match the power of the employing class with the
greater power of the working class.
</p>
<p>
That union is the one big union of the IWW.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="four"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#4: Is the IWW
Dual?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
No. The IWW is the only union which organizes workers as a
class, instead of herding labor into small groups which war
against each other for the sole benefit of the employing
class. The IWW does not believe that one big union of all
workers is dual to small groups that divide workers instead
of uniting them.
</p>
<p>
The IWW does not hope to change the labor movement by
boring from within to seize control of established unions
not does it seek to elect its members to pie-card jobs.
Such maneuvers, even when successful, result in no real
gain for labor and only illusory benefits for the
victorious group.
</p>
<p>
Today's inadequate labor movement can be changed, not by a
shift of rulers or control, but only by a rank and file
that is conscious of its strength and aware of its goal--a
world fit for human beings to live in.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="five"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#5: Who Belongs
Now?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Some of the best and most capable unionists are already
members of the IWW. They are veterans of many a bitter
struggle for improved wages and conditions; rebels against
an unjust social order who freely offer their hearts and
brains to make labor's bright dream of a better world come
true. They are people whom one is proud to know; women and
men who will fight, whatever the odds, and fight on until
the battle is won.
</p>
<p>
Some of the best are not enough. The IWW needs them all.
And, equally, all who are struggling for the better world
that we can have will find they need the IWW.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="six"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#6: How Do Its Members
Benefit?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
While the IWW makes no promises of immediate gain to its
members, experience shows that members benefit materially
in direct proportion to their efforts in the organization
and on the job.
</p>
<p>
IWW members, familiar with the methods of direct action, do
much to enforce and improve conditions on the job. The
knowledge and facilities gained through the IWW often prove
a major factor in winning grievance cases.
</p>
<p>
Members, working in concert with the IWW and its press,
have succeeded many times in needling union officials into
demanding and gaining higher wages. IWW members have
rallied decisive support for unions facing defeat in
contests with employers.
</p>
<p>
These things are tangibles that directly benefit the IWW
member, as well as all labor. There are equally important
intangibles. The IWW gives its members a sense of
solidarity and a sense of direction. It makes unionists
effective by teaching them how to fight intelligently and
as a group. It offers them the companionship of the most
honest, fearless group in labor.
 </p>
<p>
<b><a name="seven"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#7: Is It
Democratic?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
The IWW is a fortress of democracy. While majority vote
rules, there is scrupulous regard for the right of a
minority to hold differing views. All the important
questions, including the election of officials, are decided
by referendum vote of the membership. Officials who fail to
carry out the desire of the majority are subject to
immediate recall. "Pie cards" are not tolerated in the IWW.
</p>
<p>
Wages of officials and employees of the union are set to
the average pay received by the members in industry. Terms
in office are rigidly limited. Most of the work in the IWW
is done without charge because the organization is composed
of workers who believe in their movement and gladly give
their utmost to promote its growth.
</p>
<p>
A cornerstone of the IWW is the belief that the rank and
file must control the union and its officers, instead of
being controlled by them. No union can be rank and file
that limits the freedom of its members or muzzles
minorities by a host of unnecessary regulations. Therefore
the IWW makes no more rules than there is genuine need for.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="eight"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#8: How Is Democracy
Safeguarded?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
While the structure and constitution of the IWW jealously
protect democracy, no law devised can secure or retain
democracy once the will for it is lost. The root of freedom
is not law, which people can change, but people themselves.
Best guarantee of democracy lies in the membership of the
IWW; its members, who war against tyranny and injustice,
will never allow freedom to be abridged in labor's finest
organization.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="nine"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#9: Does the IWW Build
Leaders?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
In one sense, yes. The IWW rejects "leaders" as such, for
if individuals lead they can also mislead. Labor has been
continually betrayed by leaders that it trusted and
followed. It will cease to be betrayed only when it accepts
the leadership of ideas and not the leadership of men.
</p>
<p>
Yet there are people who are quick and capable in
presenting ideas and in mapping tactics to fit conditions.
The best of them do not wish to lead and they will not
blindly follow. These are developed by the IWW--partly
because it is a rank and file organization, partly from the
shared experience of its members, partly because IWW
members have no lack of intelligence and initiative.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="ten"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#10: Why Do Employers Hate
the IWW?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
So great is the hatred and fear of employers toward the IWW
that they have tried to crush it again and again, only each
time to see it rise stronger than before.
</p>
<p>
The basis of their fear is the titanic power that is
inherent in the IWW idea. When workers are united as a
class; when they rely only on themselves; when they use
direct action to secure the entire product of the world
which their labor has built; when that day comes, no power
on earth can stop the forward march of humanity and that
day will forever crumble the stolen power of a master
class.
</p>
<p>
A root of the employers' hatred is the unyielding honesty
of the IWW. It will not compromise. It will not
collaborate. It will not sell out. It will not retreat or
surrender.
</p>
<p>
Employers do not fear unions that collaborate with them.
The "unionism" of such organizations is so false and can be
so cheaply purchased that they are constantly used as a
strike-breaking force to smash the picket lines of other
unions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Other unions accept the power of the employing class. The
IWW challenges that power.
</li>
<li>
Other unions beg for crumbs from the loaf of bread that
labor produces. The IWW demands the whole loaf.
</li>
<li>
Other unions, servile to employers, attack strikes of
other unions and parade through picket lines. The IWW, in
words and practice, tries to build a working class unity
so powerful that labor will be invincible.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That is why employers have begged for agreements with other
unions in order to prevent the IWW from representing
workers. Bosses want unions they can control, not the one
big union controlled by workers.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="11"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#11: Is the IWW a
Responsible Union?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Entirely--to its members and to the working class. It has
not and never will be responsible in the sense used by
employers in praising other unions--a tamed, house-broken
division of labor which is responsible to the boss for
restraining its own members from injuring him.
</p>
<p>
The IWW does not sell out its membership. It does not
betray the interests of labor. It is responsible only to
the working class.
</p>
<p>
The IWW has been called red but it has never been called
yellow.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="12"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#12: Is the IWW
Radical?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
It is as radical as a scientist in her laboratory . . . as
radical as a surgeon planning the removal of a diseased
growth . . . as radical as a teacher must be to tell the
truth.
</p>
<p>
It is well to note that from radicalism has flowed all that
makes life better today than yesterday. It is now, as in
the past, the only force capable of leading the world out
of its night of hunger, hatred and fear.
</p>
<p>
Humanity advances over a path blazed by radicals and
stained with their blood. So long as there is injustice
there will be radicals. The name itself is the proudest
title of free men and women.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="13"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#13: Does the IWW
Advocate Force?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
No. While the IWW uses every honorable weapon in conflicts
with employers it has never initiated the use of force. Its
chief weapon is the solidarity of the working class, which
builds, and not individual terrorism, which destroys.
</p>
<p>
Employers have always been the first to resort to force and
violence and the IWW teaches only what the law affirms,
that workers have the right to defend themselves against
attack.
</p>
<p>
Violence is not necessary when, united as a class, all that
workers need to do is fold their arms to gain the world.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="14"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#14: Is the IWW
American?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
One might ask if freedom is American or if justice and
humanity are American. Wherever workers toil, wherever
masters rule, there, is the IWW or IWW thinking. Since
economic injustice is worldwide so, also, is the IWW.
</p>
<p>
In a narrower sense the IWW, organized in Chicago in 1905,
is far more "American" than the corporations, financed by
native and foreign masters, which seek to dictate
subsistence conditions for American workers. The master
class of all nations would force workers into slavery. The
IWW would make workers free.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="15"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#15: Is the IWW
Anti Religious?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
No. It has no religious bias and it does not interfere with
the religious belief of any member. Such beliefs are part
of the freedom of humanity and the IWW strives to extend
freedom, never to lessen it.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="16"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#16: Why Do Labor Skates
Oppose the IWW?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
"Labor leaders" of other unions have so entrenched
themselves in office that they long ago ceased to represent
the interests of labor or heed the will of the union
membership.
</p>
<p>
First formed in frank recognition of the opposing interests
of worker and employer, other unions have become so
decadent that today their chief concern, at best, is to beg
for crumbs from the loaf they produce. This debasement is
reflected even more clearly in the type of "leaders" (Beck
of the Teamsters, Hutchinson of the Carpenters, MacGowan of
the Boilermakers, etc.) who act as trustees for labor.
</p>
<p>
The basic concern of the labor skate is to perpetuate
himself in office and to make that office personally
profitable. This is done by crushing democracy, muzzling
the rank and file, and punishing revolt or even criticism
by summary expulsion.
</p>
<p>
The interests of such "labor leaders" with employers are
identical. Both are concerned with riding, as parasites, on
the backs of labor. Both profit from the suppression of
rank and file demands or protests. Both benefit from
maintenance of a servile job trust, chiefly concerned with
the profits of its "leaders" and the employers.
</p>
<p>
Labor skates oppose the IWW, not because they don't
understand it but because they understand it well. A
victorious IWW means the end of domination and privilege;
it will signal the beginning of complete control by the
rank and file of labor.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="17"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#17: Is the IWW
Secret?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Although there have been times (as with other unions) when
members, to guard themselves from beating or lynching, have
had to carry their IWW cards inside their shoes, the IWW
has never been a secret organization.
</p>
<p>
Members of the IWW are proud of their red cards, which mark
them as women and men and not driven sheep. Halls are open
to all; union meetings are held regularly and openly;
public meetings are advertised and are open to all workers.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="18"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#18: How About
Politics?</a></b>
</p>
<p>
The IWW, as an organization, is non-political and it does
not interfere with political beliefs or activities of its
members. It requires only that political views do not
create division within the union. This rule enables workers
of all political beliefs to join together without friction
to advance their economic interests.
</p>
<p>
The IWW concentrates on direct economic action because
history shows that whoever holds economic power also holds
political power. The IWW believes that whatever is "given"
to workers by politicians can as quickly, with interest
piled on the "debt," be taken away. (Need the Wagner Act,
followed by Taft-Hartley, be cited?) Only that which labor
wins by its own economic strength can be retained.
</p>
<p>
The hard lesson, fully absorbed by the IWW, is that labor
cannot depend on pie-cards, politicians or prayers. Labor
can only rely on labor; if it wins it must win by its own
economic unity and strength.
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="19"></a><a href="../culture/official/qanda/#contents">#19: What is Direct
Action?</a></b>

It is the action labor takes when it fights in the direct,
natural way and that which brings greatest results. When
workers rebel on the job and slow down or cease work until
their grievances are redressed--that is direct action. When
workers, united as a class, conduct a general strike to
defend their interests--that is direct action.
</p>
<p>
Workers are continually betrayed when they rely on other
means than direct action--electing politicians to office,
submitting demands to arbitration, or permitting the courts
or government agencies to settle issues. These are methods
designed to benefit the employing class.
</p>
<p>
To expect justice from these sources is as naive as to
believe slot machines are made for the enrichment of those
who put money into them. The only purpose of the infrequent
payoffs is to maintain the faith of the gullible in the
"justice" of a rigged machine.
</p>
<p>
Employers are vitally concerned only when labor uses direct
action to win its demands, for it is a method that is not
easy or cheap to combat. Workers have invariably gained
more by acting directly than could have been won by playing
ring around the rosey with employer-controlled agencies.
</p>
<p>
Direct action tore the chains of open slavery from
humanity. Over the centuries it has established individual
rights and modified the life and death power of the master
class. Used fully, used wisely and well, direct action can
forever end hunger, injustice and the mastery of humans by
other humans.
