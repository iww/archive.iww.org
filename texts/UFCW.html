   Article 32(A) of the UFCW International Constitution: if any conflict
   should arise between Local Union bylaws and the Constitution and laws
   of the International Union, or interpretations of either, such
   Constitution, laws, or interpretations shall control.
   
                                  PREAMBLE
                                      
   Because the history of workers has been but the record of constant
   struggle against oppression by the wealthy and powerful,
   
   And because wealth, with its accompanying power, is becoming more and
   more concentrated in the hands of the few;
   
   And because the organization of workers into trade unions is essential
   to the economic, social, and political freedom of society and to the
   successful functioning of a democracy;
   
   And because in union there is strength and workers are better able
   collectively to secure their fair share of the profits accruing from
   their toil;
   
   This International Union is created in order to elevate the social and
   economic status of workers and, further, to advance the principles and
   practice of freedom and democracy for all.

   persons who are members and consist of an unlimited number of Local
   Unions and other chartered bodies, all of which shall bear the name

   Unis de l'Alimentation et du Commerce and shall be subject to this
   Constitution and any laws enacted pursuant to it. The International
   Union shall not be dissolved while there are three dissenting Local
   Unions.
   
   (B) The International Headquarters of the United Food and Commercial
   Workers International Union shall be located in the metropolitan
   Washington, D.C. area unless otherwise determined by the International
   Executive Board.

   purpose of improving wages, hours, benefits, and working conditions on
   local, national, or international levels; to obtain the status of
   exclusive bargaining representative of persons employed within the

   grievances and enforce all other rights arising out of such collective
   bargaining relationships; to encourage members and all workers to
   register and vote; to support research in our industries for the
   benefit of its members; to advance and safeguard the full employment,
   economic security, and social welfare of its members and of workers
   generally; to protect and extend democratic institutions, civil rights
   and liberties, and the traditions of social and economic justice of
   the United States and Canada; to function as an autonomous
   International Union affiliated with other International Unions in
   national and international federations; to print and disseminate
   publications; to protect and preserve the International Union as an
   institution and to perform its legal and contractual obligations; to
   protect the International Union and all of its chartered bodies from

   who are opposed to the basic principles of democracy and democratic
   unionism; to acquire, receive, hold, manage, lease, convey, invest,
   expend, or otherwise use the funds and property of this organization
   to carry out the duties and to achieve the objectives set forth in

   unlawful discharge, or other forms of injustice or oppression; to
   sponsor, encourage, engage in, and support, financially and otherwise,
   educational, legislative, political, civic, social, health, welfare,
   community, or charitable projects or activities; and to support and

   combine for their mutual protection and benefit.

                         Membership Classifications
                                      
   (A) All persons are eligible for membership in the United Food and
   Commercial Workers International Union whose membership is not
   otherwise restricted or precluded by this Constitution or by other
   actions consistent with and authorized by this Constitution or
   International law, provided that no such restrictions or preclusions
   shall be based upon race, creed, color, sex, national origin,
   religion, disability, sexual orientation, or age. Membership shall be
   in accordance with the following classifications, and no member shall
   hold more than one classification of membership at any one time:
   active, affiliated, paid-up life, nonactive, general, and honorary.
   Persons who have been suspended or expelled, are on withdrawal status,
   or have resigned their membership, or any other person who is not a
   member in accordance with the six classifications of membership
   provided for in this Article, shall not be considered members for any
   purpose, except as may be directed by the International President or
   the International Executive Board following an appeal under this
   Constitution.
   
   (B) 1. An individual is eligible to be an active member if he or she
   is: employed within a collective bargaining unit represented by the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies; employed by an
   employer who is the subject of an active organizing effort by the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies; an employee or
   salaried officer of the International Union or any of its chartered
   bodies or of any organization approved by the International Executive
   Board with which the International Union or any of its chartered
   bodies has affiliated; a member of the International Union through a
   Local Union or a division of a Local Union which was a professional or
   other association that has been chartered by or merged with the
   International or any of its chartered bodies; or working as a barber,
   cosmetologist, or independent insurance agent; except that, at the
   request of the Executive Board of a Local Union, the International
   President may extend the active membership of any member in that Local
   Union during a period of unemployment, if the International President
   determines that exceptional circumstances warrant such extension,
   subject to an appeal to the International Executive Committee. Receipt
   by the Local Union of the current dues and the required initiation or
   reinstatement fee, or any installment established by the Local Union
   for payment of such fee, is required for an eligible individual to
   become an active member. Continued payment of dues, and, if
   applicable, any remaining installments of the required initiation or
   reinstatement fee, is required to maintain active membership.
   
   2. An active member who is not actively working due to layoff,
   illness, disability, or a contractually provided leave of absence, and
   has applicable recall or reemployment rights which have not expired
   under the collective bargaining agreement, or who has been discharged
   and has a grievance pending under the collective bargaining agreement,
   may elect (1) to continue to pay dues and maintain active membership
   for the temporary period for which said recall or reemployment rights
   are valid or said grievance is pending, but in neither event for
   longer than two years, (2) to apply for another classification of
   membership provided for in this Article, if eligible, or (3) to apply
   for a withdrawal card pursuant to the provisions of Article 6.
   
   (C) An individual is eligible to be an affiliated member if he or she
   is a former active member who is no longer eligible for active
   membership in the International Union. Payment of the applicable dues
   is required to become an affiliated member and to maintain such
   membership. .
   
   (D) 1. Any Local Union may provide in its bylaws for the issuance of
   paid-up life membership in the Local Union to any of its members who
   have accumulated 25 or more years' active membership in the
   International Union and who are no longer eligible for active
   membership in the International Union.
   
   2. Proposals to grant paid-up life memberships shall be introduced and
   voted on at a regular meeting of the Executive Board of the Local
   Union. A decision by the Executive Board not to grant paid-up life
   membership may be appealed at the next regular membership meeting of
   the Local Union.
   
   If paid-up life membership is approved for any member, the President
   of the Local Union shall immediately notify the International
   Secretary-Treasurer of such action. If such member again becomes
   eligible for active membership in the International Union, he or she
   shall deposit his or her paid-up life membership card in the same
   manner as provided for withdrawal cards in Article 6.
   
   (E) An individual is eligible to be a nonactive member if he or she is
   an owner-operator of an establishment within the jurisdiction of the
   International Union. Payment of the applicable dues is required to
   become a nonactive member and to maintain such membership.
   
   (F) 1. Any member who is no longer eligible for active membership in
   the International Union and who desires to maintain membership in the
   International Union shall, on or before the first day of the month
   following the date of issue of his or her withdrawal card, deposit it
   at International Headquarters in order to become a general member. Any
   general member who again becomes eligible for active membership in the
   International Union shall deposit his or her general membership card
   with the Local Union within whose jurisdiction he or she is employed
   in the same manner as is provided for withdrawal cards in Article 6.
   
   2. When a member applies for general membership, he or she shall be
   advised by the International Secretary-Treasurer, by certified mail,
   of his or her death benefits standing, if any, as of the time of
   application, subject to appeal to the International President.
   
   3. General members shall pay to the International Union $4.00 per
   month dues, said dues to be payable on or before the first day of the
   month in advance, except that any person who became a general member
   before August 1, 1972, shall pay dues of $2.00 per month. If dues are
   not so paid, such general member is delinquent.
   
   (G) No person shall hold honorary membership in any Local Union of
   this International Union. The International Executive Board shall have
   exclusive authority to confer upon any individual honorary membership
   in the International Union in recognition of distinguished public
   service.
   
   (H) All applications for membership in this International Union shall
   be made on forms furnished or approved by the International
   Secretary-Treasurer. The Local Union shall retain such applications
   and enter all information required for new members on a monthly
   membership report form which is provided or approved by the
   International Union and which shall be forwarded to the International
   Secretary-Treasurer.
   
   (I) Members shall hold membership through the Local Union in whose
   jurisdiction they are working or last worked, except for members
   employed by the International Union or intermediate chartered bodies,
   who shall hold membership in such Local Union as may be determined by
   the International President, subject to an appeal to the International
   Executive Committee. Where a member works within the jurisdiction of
   more than one Local Union, such member shall hold membership through
   the Local Union in whose jurisdiction such member first worked. No
   member shall be permitted to hold membership in more than one Local
   Union of this International Union.
   
   (J) Employers, except for owner-operators, are not eligible for
   membership in the International Union; provided, however, that any
   member becoming an employer, other than an owner operator, shall be
   entitled to a withdrawal card.
   
   (K) Any person who is a member of, subscribes to, or supports the
   principles of an organization having as its purpose to overthrow the
   government of the United States or Canada by force or violence, to
   deny to citizens the guarantee of the Bill of Rights, or to throttle
   or eliminate a free trade labor movement, shall not be eligible for
   admission to membership in this International Union, nor shall such
   person hold membership therein. Any member charged as stated above
   shall be tried in accordance with the procedure set forth in this
   International Constitution and laws and, if found guilty, shall be
   forever barred from membership in this International Union.

   their Local Union's bylaws and this Constitution.
   
   (B) Affiliated and paid-up life members may be privileged to attend
   membership meetings and serve on committees as the Local Union
   President may determine. Such members may, at the request of the Local
   Union President, make reports or otherwise address such meetings. They
   shall have no voice or vote in Union affairs, nor shall they hold
   Union office or be elected a delegate.
   
   (C) Nonactive, general, and honorary members, and nonmembers shall be
   allowed to attend and address Union meetings at the discretion of the
   Local Union President. Such persons shall have no voice or vote in
   Union affairs, nor shall they hold Union office or be elected a
   delegate.
   
   (D) Active, affiliated, nonactive, and general members have the
   privilege of obtaining withdrawal cards provided that they are
   eligible pursuant to the requirements of Article 6. If otherwise
   eligible, active members may obtain military leave courtesy cards.
   
                                 ARTICLE 6
                                      
             Withdrawal Cards and Military Leave Courtesy Cards
                                      
   (A) The following members whose current dues and fees have been paid
   shall be entitled to withdrawal cards without charge therefore:
   
   1. Members who become employers;
   
   2. Members no longer employed within a collective bargaining unit
   represented by and within the jurisdiction of the Local Union;
   
   3. Members whose positions are excluded from coverage by a collective
   bargaining agreement;
   
   4. Members who are employed by the International Union or any of its
   chartered bodies who are represented by another labor organization for
   purposes of collective bargaining with the International Union or any
   of its chartered bodies;
   
   5. Members no longer employed by an employer who is the subject of an
   active organizing effort by the International Union or any of its
   chartered bodies and who is not a party to a collective bargaining
   agreement with the International Union or any of its chartered bodies;
   and
   
   6. Members who terminate their affiliated, nonactive, and general
   membership and are not eligible for active membership.
   
   (B) Withdrawal cards shall be dated as of the first of the month
   following the member's eligibility to receive such card.
   
   (C) Persons holding withdrawal cards may maintain continuous
   membership:
   
   1. By depositing the withdrawal card with the International Union no
   later than the first day of the month following the date of issuance,
   along with one month's dues, as provided in Article 4(F), with the
   International Union and becoming a general member as provided in
   Article 4(F), or
   
   2. If eligible for active membership, by depositing the withdrawal
   card, together with the payment of the current dues, with the Local
   Union within whose jurisdiction he or she is employed or last held
   membership within one calendar month from the date of its issuance.
   
   (D) Any person possessing a withdrawal card and making application for
   membership in a Local Union shall be accepted as a reinstated member
   without the payment of a fee, except the current dues, provided the
   card is deposited with the Local Union within whose jurisdiction such
   person is employed within 30 days from the date of employment within a
   collective bargaining unit represented by the International Union or
   such Local Union, or within 30 days from the date of employment by the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies, unless a longer
   period of time is duly established by such Local Union. Any person who
   is employed within a collective bargaining unit represented by the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies and fails to
   deposit his or her withdrawal card as prescribed in this paragraph
   shall have his or her withdrawal card voided and shall not be
   reinstated to membership without the payment of the applicable fee.
   
   (E) In the event any member whose current dues and fees have been paid
   enters the military service of the United States or Canada, whether
   voluntarily or by draft, such member shall be entitled to, upon
   request, a military leave courtesy card with the privilege of
   depositing it with any Local Union within whose jurisdiction he or she
   is employed within a collective bargaining unit represented by the
   International Union or such Local Union within six months after
   discharge from military service, provided that such person makes
   application for membership in the required manner, presents evidence
   of his or her discharge, and pays his or her current dues.
   
   (F) During such military leave, the benefits as provided in this
   Constitution shall be inoperative; however, any such person readmitted
   under the above provisions shall immediately be restored to membership
   status in all respects as of the time of the issuance of the military
   leave courtesy card.
   
   (G) Military leave courtesy cards presented for membership after the
   aforementioned six months' period shall be honored as regular
   withdrawal cards as set forth by this Constitution in Article 6(D).
   
   (H) Recipients of withdrawal cards or military leave courtesy cards or
   holders of paid-up life or honorary membership cards receive such
   cards and privileges incident thereto in recognition of past
   membership or service or as a conferred honor. Continued possession of
   such cards and privileges incident thereto presumes that the holders
   of these cards will continue to uphold the aims, objectives, and
   principles of the International Union. Should any such person engage
   in any act which, if engaged in by a member, would constitute a
   disciplinary offense under Article 25 of this Constitution, the
   International Executive Board, after the issuance of a direction to
   such person to show cause why his or her card, membership, or
   privileges should not be voided and consideration of any response, may
   void any of the foregoing cards, memberships, or privileges.

   Executive Vice Presidents to be listed in order of their seniority on
   the International Executive Committee, and 50 International Vice
   Presidents to be listed in order of their seniority on the

   number of International Vice Presidents between regular International
   Conventions as the result of vacancies which the International
   Executive Board pursuant to its authority in Article 17(P) has not
   filled or in the event of an increase in the number of International
   Vice Presidents in said period as the result of additions which the
   International Executive Board pursuant to its authority in Article
   8(A)2 has made, the number of Vice Presidents elected at the next
   regular Convention shall be the number serving on January 1 of the
   year in which the Convention occurs. The number of International Vice
   Presidents from Canada elected at the next regular Convention shall be
   four or the number serving on January I of the year in which the
   Convention occurs, whichever is greater.
   
   (B) As a condition of assuming International office, upon installation
   each International officer shall pledge the following obligation: 1,
   (officer's name), do solemnly and sincerely pledge, on my word of
   honor, before the members and other witnesses here assembled, to
   faithfully perform and diligently execute, to the best of my ability,
   the duties and responsibilities of the office to which I have been
   elected as prescribed by the Constitution and laws of this
   International Union. I pledge that I will, to the best of my ability,
   protect and promote the democratic institutions and processes, civil
   rights and liberties, and the highest traditions of social and
   economic justice of the United States and Canada. I pledge to deliver
   to my successor in office all books, papers, and other property of the
   International Union that may be in my possession or under my control
   at the close of my official term. Further, I pledge at all times to
   bear true and faithful allegiance to this International Union and to
   uphold and support its Constitution and laws, as becomes a member and
   officer of this Union."

   5. The International President shall be authorized to convene meetings
   of the International Executive Board whenever the International
   President deems it advisable or whenever requested by a majority of
   the Board, provided, however, that the International Executive Board
   shall meet not less often than twice a year. In connection therewith,
   the International President shall fix the time and place of such
   meetings. The International President shall chair the International
   Executive Board meetings, provided that, in his or her absence, the

   reinstatement in cases where the Local Union collects no initiation or
   reinstatement fee as a result of open shop conditions mandated by law
   or contract, provided that for such open shop situations any such
   dispensation shall not provide for a fee of less than 50 percent of
   the fee required by Article 18(A)l.
   
   (E) The International Executive Board shall have authority to grant
   dispensation in the payment of initiation fees, Union dues, or other
   financial obligations relating to membership in those jurisdictions
   operating under laws or regulations which require that membership in
   good standing be a condition precedent to the filing or processing of
   petitions for certification or representation or the legal equivalent
   thereof, and where the circumstances are such that the International
   Executive Board deems such action to be necessary. Such dispensation,
   when granted, may include any part or portion of the financial
   obligations above referred to and shall be under such terms and
   conditions as the International Executive Board may stipulate.
   
   (F) Recognizing that chartered bodies in Canada operate under
   circumstances different from those experienced by other chartered
   bodies in the jurisdiction of the International Union' the
   International Executive Board shall be empowered, in a manner not
   inconsistent with the purposes of this Constitution, to give special
   consideration to Canadian chartered bodies, upon the recommendation of
   the International officers in Canada. In further recognition of the
   distinctive legal, cultural, political, historical, and national
   circumstances in Canada, the International President, the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, the International Executive
   Committee, and the International Executive Board shall consider any
   recommendations of the International officers in Canada prior to
   carrying out their respective authority on matters directly affecting
   the membership in Canada. Further, in the event of any jurisdictional
   dispute arising between chartered bodies in Canada, the International
   officers in Canada shall resolve such dispute, subject to appeal to
   the International President and a further appeal to the International
   Executive Board.
   
   (G) The International Executive Board shall have the authority to
   establish a program of union benefits and services for such categories
   of persons as it may designate who are not actively engaged in work
   within a collective bargaining unit represented by the International
   Union or any of its chartered bodies and to prescribe the rules
   governing membership in such program. Such program shall entitle its
   members to such rights and privileges as may be determined by the
   International Executive Board, provided that such rights and
   privileges shall not include the right to vote in Union affairs, nor
   to hold Union office or be elected a delegate.
   
   (H) The International Executive Board may delegate any of its specific
   powers to the International Executive Committee or to the
   International President, to be exercised by the International
   Executive Committee or the International President on its behalf
   during the interval between meetings of the International Executive
   Board.
   
   (I) 1. The International Executive Board by the vote of two-thirds of
   its members shall have the power to call a special Convention of the
   International Union to consider such questions as the International
   Executive Board by the same vote shall certify to it. A special
   Convention shall be convened by such procedures as a majority of the
   International Executive Board shall specify, which may include a
   specification that the delegates, but not votes, pursuant to the
   apportionment formula of Article 15(B), from each Local Union be
   reduced.
   
   2. No sooner than 18 months from the time the last Convention was
   adjourned, seven or more Local Unions comprising not less than 25
   percent of the membership of the International Union, acting by a vote
   of the majority of the members of each Local Union present and voting
   at a special meeting called for such purpose, may submit a request for
   a special Convention, specifying the particular question or questions
   to be considered. The International Secretary-Treasurer shall, within
   15 days of the receipt of such request, forward the request to all
   Local Unions for a membership vote. If Local Unions comprising at
   least two-thirds of the membership of the International Union, acting
   by a vote of the majority of the members of each Local Union present
   and voting at a special meeting for that purpose, shall, within 30
   days after the receipt of the communication from the International
   Secretary-Treasurer, notify the International Secretary-Treasurer of
   the approval of the request for a special Convention, such special
   Convention shall be called as hereinafter provided. Special
   Conventions called at Local Union request shall be convened within
   four months after the receipt of the required approvals from Local
   Unions. The time and place of such a special Convention shall be
   designated by the International Executive Board and shall be set forth
   in a call to be issued by the International Secretary-Treasurer at
   least 90 days prior to its opening. A special Convention shall
   consider the question or questions specified to the International
   Executive Board as set forth in the request of the Local Unions, and
   such question or questions shall be stated in the call. At any such
   special Convention the International Executive Board shall have the
   right to present for consideration and action any matter or matters it
   deems necessary in addition to those stated in the call.
   
   3. Each Local Union President shall be a delegate to special
   Conventions by virtue of election to office, except, where a Local
   Union is entitled to or elects to send only one delegate to a special
   Convention, such delegate shall be elected by secret ballot. Where a
   Local Union is entitled to more than one delegate to special
   Conventions, the Local Union Secretary-Treasurer shall be a delegate
   by virtue of election to office, except, where a Local Union is
   entitled to or elects to send only two delegates to a special
   Convention, the second delegate shall be elected by secret ballot. The
   remaining delegates and alternates to which a Local Union is entitled
   shall be nominated and elected by secret ballot in accordance with the
   procedures for the nomination and election of Local Union officers as
   provided in Article 35 of this Constitution, except as provided in the
   procedures specified by the International Executive Board.
   
   (J) The International Executive Board shall have the power to
   authorize and effectuate the merger of any other organization into the
   United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, where such
   merger can be effectuated without amendment to this Constitution. The
   International Executive Board may waive the application of any
   provision of this Constitution for a period not to exceed three years
   or January 1 of the year following the next regular International
   Convention, whichever occurs later, where such waiver is necessary to
   effectuate the merger; except that, the International Executive Board
   may approve beyond such period a per capita tax payable on members of
   the merging organization that is higher than that provided in Article
   18(A)3 of this Constitution, as provided in a merger agreement with
   the merging organization. Where the effectuation of a merger of the
   United Food and Commercial Workers International Union with another
   organization requires amendment to this Constitution, the
   International Executive Board may authorize the International
   President and International Secretary-Treasurer to enter into
   discussions directed toward merger. Approval of such a merger shall be
   submitted by the International Executive Board to a regular Convention
   or to a special Convention called for by it for the purpose of
   considering the proposed merger.
   
   (K) The International Executive Board shall have the power to
   authorize the voluntary merger of Local Unions of the United Food and
   Commercial Workers International Union or of an organization not
   chartered by the United Food and Commercial Workers International
   Union into a Local Union of the United Food and Commercial Workers
   International Union. The International Executive Board shall prescribe
   the conditions under which any such merger shall be effectuated, and
   may waive the application of any provision of Articles 34 and 35 of
   this Constitution for a period not to exceed the first full term of
   office following the merger, where such waiver is necessary to
   effectuate the merger. Further, the International Executive Board may
   approve Local Union bylaws providing for constitutional officers
   additional to those provided for in Article 34(A) where such approval
   would facilitate such merger.
   
   (L) The International Executive Board shall be empowered to affiliate
   this International Union with such national and international bodies
   as the International Executive Board believes is in the best interests
   of this International Union.
   
   (M) If any provision of this Constitution shall be declared or shall
   otherwise become invalid or impaired by virtue of any federal, state,
   or provincial legislative enactment, or by virtue of any decision or
   regulation of any federal, state, or provincial court or
   administrative agency, the International Executive Board shall have
   the authority to suspend the operation of any such provision during
   the period of its invalidity or impairment and shall also have the
   authority to substitute a provision or provisions which, to the extent
   permitted by law, will meet the objections and which will be in accord
   with the intent and spirit of the invalid provision. The International
   Executive Board shall give written notice to all Local Unions and all
   intermediate chartered bodies after exercising this power. If any
   provision of this Constitution should be held invalid by operation of
   law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
   this Constitution shall not be affected thereby
   
                                 ARTICLE 9
                                      
                     International Executive Committee
                                      
   (A) The International President, International Secretary-Treasurer,
   and the three International Executive Vice Presidents shall, by virtue
   of their offices, constitute the International Executive Committee.
   The International President shall serve as chairperson of the
   International Executive Committee, and a record shall be kept of its
   meetings.
   
   (B) The Inter-national Executive Committee shall purchase, manage, and
   control all real property of the International Union, and may sell,
   rent, lease, encumber, and improve the same in such manner as the
   majority of the International Executive Committee shall direct, but
   shall have no right to sell, convey, or encumber the current or a
   successor International Headquarters without the approval of the
   International Executive Board.
   
   (C) The title to the International Headquarters and other real
   property currently held by the International Union, or which may
   hereafter be acquired, shall be vested by proper conveyance in the
   name of a corporate trustee building corporation or in the
   International Executive Committee and their successors in office, to
   be held by the building corporation or the International Executive
   Committee in trust for the sole use and benefit of this International
   Union, provided that, the title to any real property held by the
   International Union in Canada shall be vested by proper conveyance in
   the name of a building corporation or a trustee or trustees, and their
   successors in office, designated by the International Executive
   Committee, in accordance with the applicable law in Canada, in trust
   for the sole use and benefit of this International Union.
   
   (D) The International Executive Committee shall perform such other
   duties as are provided in this Constitution and as may be directed
   from time to time by the International Executive Board. The
   International Executive Committee may delegate any of its specific
   authority to the International President, to be exercised by him or
   her on its behalf.
   
   (E) The International Executive Committee shall make a report to each
   regular Convention of all business transacted in connection with the
   International Headquarters and other real property of the
   International Union.
   
   (F) No member of the International Executive Committee shall receive
   any additional compensation by virtue of his or her services in
   connection with the management and control of International
   Headquarters or other real property of the International Union.
   
   (G) 1. A trusteeship may be imposed by the International Union upon a
   chartered body to correct corruption or financial malpractice,
   including mishandling or endangering Union funds or property, or the
   funds or property of any trust in which the Union has an interest;
   assure the performance of collective bargaining agreements or other
   duties of a bargaining representative; restore democratic procedures;
   or otherwise carry out the legitimate objectives of the International
   Union, including the enforcement of compliance with federal, state, or
   provincial law, the Constitution or laws of the International Union,
   the approved bylaws of the chartered body, or the rules, decisions, or
   orders of the International Executive Board, the International
   Executive Committee, or International officers made within the scope
   of their authority under this Constitution. Whenever in the judgment
   of the International Executive Committee such action is required, it
   shall have the power to place such chartered body in trusteeship or
   take such other temporary action as it deems necessary, provided that
   any such action shall not be authorized in Canada unless concurred in
   by a majority of the International officers in Canada. Within 30 days
   following the imposition of a trusteeship, a hearing shall commence to
   determine whether the trusteeship is justified and shall be continued.
   
   2. a) If a trusteeship is imposed, the International President shall
   appoint a trustee, who shall administer the affairs of the chartered
   body during the trusteeship. In Canada, such trustee shall be a member
   of a Canadian Local Union. The trustee shall act under the supervision
   of the International President, who may remove him or her at any time
   and appoint a successor.
   
   b) The trustee shall take immediate charge of the affairs of the
   chartered body and shall have the right, upon demand, to all assets
   and records for the period that he or she is in charge, to be held in
   trust for the benefit of the members of the chartered body. During the
   trusteeship, the assets of the chartered body shall be expended for
   the conduct of its affairs. If, after the trusteeship hearing, the
   International Executive Committee ratifies the imposition of the
   trusteeship, the International President may require the chartered
   body to bear the expenses incurred in connection with the imposition,
   servicing, administration, and termination of the trusteeship. The
   trustee shall be bonded in sufficient amount as determined by the
   International Secretary-Treasurer to safeguard the assets of the
   chartered body.
   
   c) When a trusteeship is imposed, the officers of the chartered body
   shall be suspended from office, and their functions shall pass to the
   trustee, who may delegate such functions to deputy trustees, interim
   officers, and others as deemed necessary, subject to the approval of
   the International President. If the International Executive Committee
   determines after hearing that the trusteeship is justified, and
   thereby ratifies the trusteeship, all officers within the chartered
   body shall immediately be removed, and the trustee may continue to
   delegate their functions as provided above. If the International
   Executive Committee determines that the trusteeship was not justified,
   or should not continue, the suspended officers shall be restored to
   their prior offices without loss of salary or benefits, unless
   otherwise determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in
   this Constitution.
   
   d) At any time after the trusteeship has been ratified, the trustee
   shall have authority to bring disciplinary proceedings, including the
   filing of charges, against any member or former officer of the
   chartered body whom he or she has reasonable grounds to believe has
   contributed to the conditions leading to the establishment of the
   trusteeship. The trustee may also file charges against any member for
   other violations of his or her duties and obligations as a member,
   provided that in such case the trustee files charges with the
   International President within six months after the basis for the
   alleged violation has been discovered or should have been discovered.
   In any disciplinary proceeding held during the trusteeship, including
   any proceeding involving charges which were pending at the time the
   trusteeship was imposed, the accused shall be tried before a
   representative appointed by the International President. Trial
   proceedings shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of
   Article 26(A), provided that such provisions are not inconsistent with
   the provisions of this Article. The representative appointed to
   conduct the trial shall, upon its completion, submit his or her
   findings and recommendations to the International Executive Committee
   with the trial record. The International Executive Committee is
   thereupon authorized to issue its decision and take such disciplinary
   measures as the circumstances warrant, including fine, suspension, or
   expulsion. Appeals from the decision of the International Executive
   Committee may be taken to the International Executive Board in
   accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 26(C), provided
   that such provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
   Article.
   
   e) The autonomy of the chartered body shall be suspended during the
   period of the trusteeship, except that membership votes shall be held
   where required under Articles 23 and 38 and as otherwise required
   under this Article.
   
   f) The trustee shall make periodic reports to the International
   President on the progress of the trusteeship. He or she shall also
   hold meetings of the membership not less than quarterly for the
   purpose of reporting to the membership on the affairs and transactions
   of the chartered body.
   
   3. a) The trusteeship hearing shall be conducted in the vicinity of
   the chartered body involved by a hearing officer appointed by the
   International President, provided that the hearing officer shall be a
   member of a Canadian Local Union if the chartered body is located in
   Canada.
   
   b) Adequate notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing
   shall be sent by the International President to the members of the
   chartered body.
   
   c) The chartered body shall have the right to be represented by its
   officers or suspended officers, who, subject to rules formulated by
   the hearing officer to prevent undue repetition, shall have the right
   to examine and cross-examine witnesses, present other evidence, and
   argue the case for or against trusteeship.
   
   d) Members shall have a right to testify, subject to rules formulated
   by the hearing officer to prevent undue repetition. If a member
   alleges that the officers or suspended officers of the chartered body
   cannot adequately represent his or her interests, the hearing officer
   may determine, upon a sufficient showing, to permit the member to
   participate in the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, the
   presentation of other evidence, and the argument.
   
   e) Any officer of the chartered body who refuses to produce any
   document relevant to the hearing shall be subject to charges and
   immediate suspension from office by the International Executive
   Committee pending proceedings under Article 9(H). Any employee who
   refuses to produce such records shall be subject to immediate
   suspension or termination from employment, as determined by the
   International Executive Committee.
   
   f) The hearing officer may formulate whatever additional rules may be
   required to ensure a full, fair, and expeditious hearing.
   
   g) All testimony shall be taken under oath, and a verbatim transcript
   shall be made of the hearing.
   
   h) The hearing officer shall submit his or her findings and
   recommendations to the International Executive Committee with the
   hearing transcript and exhibits.
   
   I) Within 45 days from the date the hearing closes, the International
   Executive Committee shall issue its decision and order, which shall
   include its findings and determinations. Such decision and order shall
   be sent to the chartered body and made available to its members.
   
   j) The International President shall make available for examination by
   the members of the chartered body, at the office of the chartered
   body, a copy of the hearing officer's findings and recommendations,
   the hearing transcript, and the hearing exhibits.
   
   4. a) A decision and order of the International Executive Committee
   following the hearing specified in Article 9(G)3 may be appealed to
   the International Executive Board in accordance with the applicable
   provisions of Article 26(C) governing appeals to the International
   Executive Board.
   
   b) A decision and order of the International Executive Committee
   determining that a trusteeship is justified shall constitute
   ratification or authorization of the trusteeship by the International
   Union unless reversed on appeal.
   
   5. a) The trusteeship shall continue for such period as the
   International Executive Committee shall consider necessary for the
   reorganization or stabilization of the affairs of the chartered body
   to achieve the purposes of the trusteeship; provided, however, that
   the body in trusteeship shall have the right to petition for removal
   of the trusteeship at intervals of not less than six months following
   the establishment of the trusteeship. Any such petition must first be
   duly signed by a majority of the active members of the chartered body
   and then filed with the International President.
   
   b) Upon receipt of such petition, the International President shall at
   the earliest practicable time hold an inquiry to determine whether the
   trusteeship shall continue. The inquiry shall be conducted by a
   representative appointed by the International President, under rules
   formulated to ensure a full, fair, and expeditious inquiry. Due notice
   of the time and place of the inquiry shall be given to the members of
   the chartered body
   
   c) The representative holding the inquiry at its conclusion, shall
   submit findings and recommendations to the International Executive
   Committee. The decision of the International Executive Committee shall
   include its findings and recommendations and shall be sent to the
   members of the chartered body
   
   d) The decision of the International Executive Committee may be
   appealed to the International Executive Board by any member of the
   chartered body in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article
   26(C).
   
   6. Prior to the conclusion of the trusteeship, the trustee shall
   review the bylaws of the chartered body and shall submit his or her
   recommendations for amendment to the membership in accordance with the
   applicable provisions of Article 32(A). Prior to the conclusion of the
   trusteeship, the trustee shall conduct new elections for all offices
   of the chartered body in accordance with the Constitution of the
   International Union and the bylaws of the chartered body.
   
   7. When the trusteeship is terminated upon order of the International
   Executive Committee, the trustee shall return all assets and records
   to the chartered body and shall make an accounting of his or her
   trusteeship to the International Executive Committee and the chartered
   body.
   
   8. No obligation or liability of a chartered body which may have been
   incurred prior to the imposition of a trusteeship shall be assumed by
   or become an obligation of the ' International Union. No obligation or
   liability of a chartered body which has been placed in trusteeship,
   including obligations under existing collective bargaining agreements
   incurred subsequent to the institution of such trusteeship, shall
   become an obligation of the International Union, unless specifically
   authorized or assumed by the International Executive Board.
   
   (H) Whenever the activities of any member or officer of a chartered
   body involve, in the judgment of the International Executive
   Committee, an emergency situation injurious to the welfare or best
   interests of the International Union or a chartered body, the
   International Executive Committee is authorized to assume original
   jurisdiction in such matter, even though charges may have been filed
   with another body and are pending. Under such circumstances, the
   International Executive Committee may suspend the person from
   membership or office, but it shall be required to accord such member
   or officer a hearing, upon notice of the charges against him or her,
   and the hearing shall commence within 30 days of such suspension. The
   International Executive Committee shall have authority to appoint a
   temporary successor to any officer thus suspended, to serve until the
   charges are disposed of. Such hearing shall be conducted by a
   representative appointed by the International President, and the
   proceedings shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of
   Article 26(A), provided that such provisions are not inconsistent with
   the provisions of this paragraph. Following such hearing, the
   International Executive Committee is authorized to take such
   disciplinary action as the circumstances warrant, including fine,
   suspension, expulsion, or removal from office. Appeal from the
   decision of the International Executive Committee may be taken to the
   International Executive Board. Procedure on appeals shall be governed
   by the applicable provisions of Article 26(C).
   
   (I) Whenever, in the judgment of the International Executive
   Committee, a chartered body is working against the best interests of
   the International Union, including, but not limited to, violation of
   the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the International
   Union, the International Executive Committee shall have the authority
   to expel such chartered body after a hearing conducted pursuant to the
   applicable provisions of Article 9(G), subject to an appeal to the
   International Executive Board.
   
                                 ARTICLE 10
                                      
                          International President
                                      
   (A) The International President shall be the chief executive officer
   of the International Union and shall exercise supervision over the
   affairs of the International Union.

   all Conventions, appoint all committees, unless otherwise ordered by
   the Convention, and sign all official documents of the International
   Union.
   
   (C) The International President shall manage, conduct, and edit any
   official membership publications and any other publications of the
   International Union, subject to such editorial policy as may be
   established by the International Executive Committee.
   
   (D) The International President, in consultation with the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, shall have the authority to manage
   and control all assets of the International Union, except as otherwise
   provided in Article 9 of this Constitution. He or she shall have the
   authority, between meetings of the International Executive Board, to
   direct and approve the expenditure of the funds of the International
   Union as shall be necessary or advisable in carrying out the
   principles and objectives of the International Union and for any
   additional purposes and objectives not inconsistent therewith which
   will further the general interest and welfare of the International
   Union. Such expenditures shall be paid from the funds of the
   International Union and shall be paid by check cosigned, or electronic
   transfer authorized, by the International President and the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, provided that, in the event of a
   vacancy in either of such offices, the seniority provisions of Article
   17(Q) shall govern as applicable. He or she shall have the authority
   to invest the surplus funds of the International Union where he or she
   deems it advisable, subject to the approval of the International
   Executive Committee. He or she shall be further empowered to do all
   acts, whether or not expressly authorized in this Constitution, which
   he or she deems necessary or proper for the protection of the assets
   of the International Union, subject to the approval of the
   International Executive Committee. No expenditure of International
   Union funds shall be made except upon authorization of the
   International President, except as otherwise provided in this
   Constitution.
   
   (E) 1. The International President shall have the authority to
   interpret the Constitution and laws of the International Union and to
   decide all questions relating thereto, subject to an appeal to the
   International Executive Board. The International President shall have
   the authority to resolve any dispute between chartered bodies, between
   chartered bodies and members thereof, or between chartered bodies and
   the International Union, for which no appeal to the International
   President, International Executive Committee, or International
   Executive Board is otherwise provided in this Constitution, and to
   direct such steps as may be necessary to resolve the dispute, provided
   that any appeal or request for intervention pursuant to such authority
   is filed with the International President within 45 days from the
   decision or action which is the subject of the dispute; except that,
   the International President, for good cause shown, may extend the time
   within which any such appeal or request may be filed. The decision of
   the International President regarding such dispute may be appealed to
   the International Executive Board not later than 30 days after such
   decision has been rendered.
   
   2. The International President shall not have the authority to direct
   any change in a chartered body's disposition of a member's grievance
   arising out of a collective bargaining agreement between the chartered
   body and an employer.
   
   (F) The International President, in consultation with the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, shall establish and maintain such
   departments, trade divisions, and offices as are necessary to service
   and promote the interests of the various trades, occupations, and
   professions comprising the International Union's membership and to
   more effectively administer the International Union's affairs.
   Further, the International President, in consultation with the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, shall employ and fix the
   compensation and other terms of employment of directors, department
   heads, assistants, field representatives, and professional and other
   personnel that he or she deems advisable for the purpose of carrying
   out the duties of his or her office and to effectively administer the
   affairs of the International Union. Such personnel shall work under
   the supervision of the International President. He or she shall have
   the authority to terminate the employment of any such personnel in the
   best interest of the International Union, subject to an appeal to the
   International Executive Committee, provided that there is no other
   grievance procedure authorized by the International Union.
   
   (G) The International President or his or her designated
   representatives are authorized to visit any chartered body and attend
   and participate in any meeting, conference, or convention, including
   those of chartered bodies, in order to lend assistance, to examine the
   records and inspect the operations, or otherwise to further the
   objectives of the International Union.
   
   (H) The bond of the International President shall be in such amount as
   the International Executive Board shall deem sufficient to fully
   protect the International Union and shall be furnished by a surety
   company approved by the International Executive Board, the premium
   thereof to be paid by the International Union.
   
   (I) The International President, or his or her designated
   representative, is hereby authorized, by virtue of his or her office,
   to attend as an official delegate of the International Union all
   meetings, conferences, or conventions that may be held where the
   International Union is entitled to representation or where the best
   interest of the International Union may be served by his or her

   active members directly affiliated with the intermediate chartered
   body, rather than with a Local Union, shall be apportioned delegates
   and votes based on the number of active members directly affiliated
   with it and in accordance with the formula of Article 15(B) 1.
   Apportionment of delegates and votes shall be based on only those
   active members directly affiliated with the intermediate chartered
   body, and only such members shall be eligible to represent the
   intermediate chartered body as delegates and alternates to the
   Convention. Wherever the term "Local Union" or "Local Unions" is used
   in Articles 14, 15, 16, and 17 of this Constitution, it shall be
   deemed to encompass any intermediate chartered body with any directly
   affiliated bargaining units and active members.
   
   (C) The number of delegates apportioned to a Local Union shall be
   determined by the International Secretary-Treasurer upon the basis of
   its average monthly active membership for the 12 calendar months
   ending with October in the year preceding the year in which the
   Convention is held. Each Local Union may elect a number of alternates,
   as determined by the Local Union Executive Board prior to nominations,
   up to the number of delegates to which it is entitled, in accordance
   with the procedures for the election of delegates.
   
   (D) If a vacancy occurs in the Local Union's delegation, the alternate
   who was elected by the greatest number of votes, or, in the case of a
   tie, the alternate chosen by a vote of that Local Union's remaining
   delegates, shall succeed to the vacancy; provided that, if the vacancy
   occurs as the result of a temporary absence from the Convention, the
   vacancy shall be filled only if such Local Union's seated delegates
   decide to fill such vacancy, in which case, the vacancy shall be
   filled for the period of the delegate's absence. An alternate
   succeeding to a vacancy shall have neither voice nor vote until
   recognized by the Credentials Committee.
   
   (E) Each Local Union President shall be a delegate to the regular
   Convention by virtue of election to office. Where a Local Union is
   entitled to more than one delegate to the Convention, the Local Union
   Secretary-Treasurer shall be a delegate by virtue of election to
   office. The remaining delegates and alternates to which a Local Union
   is entitled shall be nominated and elected by secret ballot in
   accordance with the procedures for the nomination and election of
   Local Union officers as provided in Article 35(C) of this
   Constitution, except as provided in this Article; provided that, if a
   Local Union is entitled to only one delegate and decides to have an
   alternate in addition to that delegate, the alternate shall be the
   Local Union Secretary-Treasurer. Where an election of delegates or
   alternates is to be conducted, nominations for all delegates and
   nominations for all alternates shall precede the conduct of the
   elections. Nominations shall not be conducted by petition. The
   election shall be conducted at polling places or by mail referendum.
   No member shall run for both delegate and alternate. Each active
   member voting shall be entitled to cast a number of votes for
   delegates and alternates up to the number of delegates and alternates
   to which the Local Union is entitled or chooses to elect, but in no
   event may a member cast more than one vote for any one nominee. Such
   delegates and alternates shall be elected by plurality vote in
   descending order of the votes received, starting with the nominee
   receiving the highest number, up to the number of delegates and
   alternates to which the Local Union is entitled or chooses to elect,
   whichever is the lesser. In the event of a tie that affects the
   outcome, there shall be a runoff election among the tied nominees. As
   provided in this paragraph, the Local Union President or
   Secretary-Treasurer shall be a delegate or alternate to the Convention
   without separate nomination and election as a delegate or alternate,
   provided that the President or Secretary-Treasurer was elected by the
   Local Union membership in the Local Union's election of officers.
   
   (F) The nomination and election of delegates to the Convention shall
   be conducted at any time during January, February, March, or April of
   the Convention year. The election of delegates to the Convention shall
   be conducted by secret ballot. Not less than 15 days prior to the
   nomination of delegates, notice shall be mailed by the Local Union to
   each member at his or her last known home address, setting forth the
   times, dates, and places for conducting the nomination of delegates to
   the Convention. Not less than 15 days prior to the election of
   delegates, notice shall be mailed by the Local Union to each member at
   his or her last known address, setting forth the times, dates, and
   places for conducting the election. Notice of nominations and election
   may be combined into a single notice, which shall be mailed not less
   than 15 days prior to nominations.
   
   (G) Any active member of the International Union, as defined in
   Article 4(B) of this Constitution, shall be eligible to vote for Local
   Union delegates to the Convention in the Local Union through which he
   or she holds his or her membership.
   
   (H) 1. Any active member of the International Union, as defined in
   Article 4(B) of this Constitution, who has been an active member of
   the International Union, or who had been a member of another
   organization merged with or chartered by the International Union or
   merged into a Local Union of the United Food and Commercial Workers
   International Union, for a continuous aggregate of at least 12 months
   preceding the month in which the Convention call is issued, shall be
   eligible to be a delegate to the Convention from the Local Union
   through which he or she holds his or her membership at the time of
   nominations, provided that said member maintains continuous active
   membership in said Local Union during the interval between his or her
   election and the commencement of the Convention.
   
   2. Nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to disqualify any
   member who accepts a salaried position with the American Federation of
   Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Canadian Labour
   Congress, the International Union, or any of its chartered bodies, or
   to disqualify the delegate or delegates of a Local Union reorganized
   within a period of less than one year. A Local Union not in possession
   of a charter from the International Union at the time the Convention
   call is issued shall not be entitled to representation in the
   Convention of the International Union.
   
   (I) 1. Not more than 15 days subsequent to the election of delegates
   in a Local Union, all challenges to the election of such delegates
   shall be submitted to the Local Union general election chairperson.
   The Local Union general election chairperson and election judges shall
   consider any such challenge and take such remedial action as they deem
   appropriate. Not more than 15 days subsequent to the decision of the
   Local Union general election chairperson and election judges
   respecting such challenge, an aggrieved challenging party may submit
   an appeal to the International President. Where a Local Union fails to
   rule on such challenge within 30 days of the Local Union election of
   delegates, a challenging party may submit an appeal to the
   International President not later than 15 days thereafter. The
   International President shall take whatever steps are deemed necessary
   to resolve the challenge to the election and enforce his or her
   decision.
   
   2. The decision of the International President may be appealed to the
   Credentials Committee not later than 15 days after such decision has
   been rendered. Such appeal shall be sent to the International
   Secretary-Treasurer, who shall refer such appeal to the Credentials
   Committee, which shall consist of not less than five uncontested
   delegates who shall be appointed by the International President not
   less than 20 days prior to the convening of the Convention. This
   committee shall meet prior to the convening of the Convention at the
   call of the International President to consider and resolve all
   appeals. This committee shall also independently review the
   credentials of all delegates and shall resolve all questions of
   irregularity. The committee shall report its ruling on appeals and
   irregularities to the Convention on the first day thereof. It may meet
   during the Convention at the call of the International President. The
   rulings of the committee shall be in force pending review by the
   Convention.
   
   3. Any challenge or appeal which could have been presented in
   compliance with these filing requirements, but was not, shall be
   deemed to have been waived.
   
   (J) The ballots and all other records pertaining to the nomination and
   election of delegates, including the membership mailing lists which
   were used to send the notices of the nomination and election of
   delegates, shall be preserved for not less than one year by the Local
   Union President.
   
   (K) A Local Union may elect fewer than its quota of delegates,
   provided that such determination be made by the Local Union membership
   prior to or at the nominating meeting. The number of votes to which a
   Local Union is entitled at Convention on all recorded votes shall be
   divided equally among the seated delegates present.
   
   (L) In the case of a Local Union entitled to two or more delegates,
   the delegates shall choose a chairperson and alternate chairperson of
   the delegation.
   
   (M) The International Union shall pay for the reasonable and necessary
   cost of transportation of the duly elected delegates to and from each
   regular International Convention. Local Unions may pay all or a
   portion of their delegates' other authorized expenses connected with
   attendance at the Convention. Where a Local Union pays for the
   expenses or the salary, wages, or lost time, not including vacation
   pay, of one of its delegates, it shall pay for the expenses or the
   salaries, wages, or lost time, not including vacation pay, of all of
   its delegates.
   
   (N) Delegates of Local Unions which as of the first day of the
   Convention are delinquent for more than one month's fees and monthly
   per capita tax, or any part thereof, shall not be seated at the
   Convention.
   
   (0) The officers of the International Union shall be delegates to the
   Convention and shall attend at the expense of the International Union.
   International officers may not make nominations or vote in the
   election of International officers unless they are delegates to the
   Convention pursuant to Article 15(E).
   
   (P) In recognition of the services and contributions to the
   International Union of its retired officers, retired International
   officers may attend regular International Conventions as fraternal
   delegates.
   
                                 ARTICLE 16
                                      
                 Regular International Convention Procedure
                                      
   (A) The proceedings of the regular Convention shall be governed by
   this Constitution and the rules adopted at each Convention. The rules
   adopted at the preceding regular Convention shall be in full force
   from the opening of the Convention until new rules are adopted. Each
   Convention may adopt rules for the conduct of its business not in
   conflict with the provisions of this Constitution. The Convention
   shall be conducted in accordance with common parliamentary procedure
   designed for the conduct of orderly and democratic meetings, unless
   otherwise provided by this Constitution or by the Convention rules.
   
   (B) It shall be the duty of the International President to preside at
   the Convention and conduct it in accordance with this Constitution and
   Convention rules. In the absence of the International President, the
   International Secretary-Treasurer shall preside, provided that, in the
   absence of both the International President and International
   Secretary-Treasurer, the seniority provisions of Article 17(Q) shall
   govern as applicable.
   
   (C) The International Secretary-Treasurer shall act as Secretary of
   the Convention. He or she shall be responsible for having a record
   kept of the proceedings of the Convention, and shall publish full
   proceedings of the Convention in convenient form and furnish one copy
   to each delegate to the Convention, each chartered Local Union, and
   members of the International Executive Board.
   
   (D) The International Executive Board shall perform such duties for
   the International President during the Convention as he or she may
   require. The International Executive Board, International Executive
   Committee, International President, and International
   Secretary-Treasurer shall submit reports of their work to each regular
   Convention. The International Secretary-Treasurer's report shall
   include a financial report for the five fiscal years preceding the
   Convention.
   
   (E) The International President, in consultation with the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, shall appoint all Convention
   committees and they shall meet at his or her call. Each committee
   shall consist of not less than five Local Union delegates. The
   International Union may pay expenses connected with service on
   committees which meet prior to the Convention.
   
   (F) Resolutions proposed by Local Unions, following adoption by their
   Executive Boards or membership, shall be submitted to the
   International President not less than 45 days prior to the convening
   of the Convention and, unless so submitted or as otherwise provided in
   this paragraph, shall not be considered by the Convention. Only the
   delegates of the Local Union proposing a resolution may question
   whether such resolution was properly adopted by such Local Union.
   Resolutions may be presented to the Convention by the International
   Executive Board at any time.
   
   (G) 1. Not less than 90 days prior to the convening of the Convention,
   all amendments to the International Constitution proposed by Local
   Unions, following adoption by their Executive Boards or membership,
   shall be submitted to the International President. Each proposal shall
   identify the Article to be amended and specifically set forth or
   describe the proposed change. The International President shall refer
   such proposed amendments to a Constitution Committee of not less than
   five delegates, who shall be appointed by him or her not less than 20
   days prior to the convening of the Convention. Unless so submitted or
   as provided in Article 16(G)2, proposed amendments to the
   International Constitution shall not be considered by the Convention.
   Only the delegates of the Local Union proposing a Constitutional
   amendment may question whether such amendment was properly proposed by
   such Local Union.
   
   2. The Constitution Committee shall meet prior to the convening of the
   Convention, at the call of the International President, to consider
   all amendments to the International Constitution proposed by Local
   Unions. Proposed Constitutional amendments originating with the
   International Executive Board may be submitted to the Constitution
   Committee for its consideration or submitted directly to the
   Convention. The Constitution Committee shall report its
   recommendations respecting any proposed Constitutional amendments
   referred to it to the Convention.
   
   (H) Immediately after the opening of each Convention, on the first
   day, the International President shall appoint the required number of
   reading clerks, sergeants-at-arms, and messengers.
   
   (I) An International Convention quorum shall consist of not less than
   25 percent of the delegates officially seated by the Convention.
   
   (J) The International Secretary-Treasurer shall prepare, for the use
   of the Convention, a list containing the number of votes to which each
   Local Union is entitled. Voting shall be by a voice, standing, or roll
   call vote of the delegates. A roll call vote shall be conducted upon a
   motion of a delegate, concurred in by 30 percent of the seated
   delegates, or directed by the presiding officer if he or she is in
   doubt as to the vote. When a roll call vote is conducted, the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, in calling the roll of the Local
   Unions, shall call out the Local Union's number and the number of
   votes to which it is entitled, except as otherwise specified in
   Article 17(H) of this Constitution, and the chairperson of each Local
   Union delegation shall announce the votes of the delegates of that
   Local Union. Any delegate may request the presiding officer to conduct
   a roll call of the delegates of the Local Union which he or she
   represents. The presiding officer may also order a roll call if he or
   she is in doubt as to the Local Union's vote.
   
                                 ARTICLE 17
                                      
                     Election of International Officers
                                      
   (A) 1. Only active members of the International Union, who have been
   active members of the International Union, or who were members of
   another organization merged with or chartered by the International
   Union, for a continuous aggregate of at least 36 months immediately
   preceding the month in which the regular Convention is held, are
   eligible to hold any office of the International Union, provided that
   said members maintain continuous active membership.
   
   2. Any officer or employee of the International Union or any of its
   chartered bodies accepting any political office, or other employment
   or position, which in the judgment of the International Executive
   Board presents a conflict of interest, or which interferes with the
   proper carrying out of duties or responsibilities as a Union officer
   or employee, shall not be eligible to serve as an officer of the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies, and any such
   officer or employee shall resign his or her office or position with
   the Union immediately, upon order of the International Executive
   Board, unless a leave of absence is granted with the approval of the
   International Executive Board. Upon failure to resign as required
   herein, the International Executive Board shall declare such office or
   position vacant and a successor shall be elected or appointed in
   accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.
   
   3. Nothing contained in this Constitution shall be construed as making
   any member ineligible to serve as an officer or delegate by virtue of
   such member's holding a salaried position with the International Union
   or any of its chartered bodies, or any organization approved by the
   International Executive Board with which the International Union or
   any of its chartered bodies has affiliated.
   
   (B) The term of office for all International officers shall begin on
   September I following the regular International Convention at which
   they are elected and shall expire on August 31 following the next
   regular International Convention, except in the case of a special
   election to fill a vacancy, in which case the term of office shall
   commence upon election by the International Executive Board and shall
   continue for the balance of the predecessor's original term.
   Ceremonial installation of newly elected officers shall take place
   immediately following their election.
   
   (C) The election of International officers shall be conducted at the
   regular Convention. Nominations shall be held on the second day of the
   Convention. The election of officers shall take place as the next
   order of Convention business. International Executive Vice Presidents
   and International Vice Presidents shall be numerically designated for
   nomination and election purposes only.
   
   (D) Nomination to International office shall be from the floor of the
   Convention. It shall require at least 15 Local Unions represented at
   the Convention to make a nomination, provided that, in nominating the
   International Vice Presidents allocated to Canada, it shall require at
   least five Canadian Local Unions represented at the Convention to make
   a nomination for such offices. In making nominations, Local Union
   action shall be determined by a vote of the delegates of the Local
   Union, shall require the support of a majority of all seated delegates
   of the Local Union, and shall be announced by the chairperson of the
   delegation or such other spokesperson as may be designated by a
   majority of the delegates. Any delegate may request the presiding
   officer to conduct a roll call of the delegates of the Local Union
   which he or she represents to verify the Local Union action. The
   presiding officer may also order a roll call if he or she is in doubt
   that a majority of the delegates support the Local Union action. No
   Local Union may nominate more than one candidate for each office.
   
   (E) Following the nominations, the nominees shall be required to
   indicate their acceptance of the nomination. No member shall be
   eligible to run for more than one International office, and no member
   who declines to accept nomination for an office shall be eligible for
   election to that office.
   
   (F) There shall be an Election Committee which shall be composed of
   not less than five Local Union delegates, who shall be appointed by
   the International President and shall not be candidates for
   International Union office. The Election Committee shall report on the
   eligibility of the nominees to the Convention prior to the election
   and conduct the subsequent election.
   
   (G) Where there is only one nominee for an office, the unopposed
   candidate shall be deemed elected by acclamation.
   
   (H) Election of International officers shall be by standing vote of
   the delegates, except that a roll call vote of the Local Unions shall
   be conducted by the Election Committee if such a vote is authorized
   pursuant to the provisions of Article 16(j) of this Constitution.
   
   (I) Each candidate may be present or be represented by a delegate to
   observe the count.
   
   (J) A majority of the votes cast for any office shall be required to
   elect. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff election shall be
   conducted. Such runoff election shall present to the delegates only
   the names of the two nominees receiving the greatest number of votes.
   
   (K) No funds of the International Union or any of its chartered bodies
   shall be used to promote the candidacy of any person for any elective
   office within the International Union.
   
   (L) No publications sponsored by or supported by the International
   Union or any chartered body shall be used to promote the candidacy of
   any person for elective office within the International Union.
   
   (M) All Convention minutes and other records pertaining to the
   election of International officers, including membership lists used to
   determine the number of delegates to which a Local Union is entitled
   and the original completed credentials of the delegates, shall be
   preserved by the International Secretary-Treasurer for at least one
   year following the election.
   
   (N) Any member desiring to protest the conduct of the election shall
   lodge his or her protest in writing within 30 days of the election
   with the International Executive Board.
   
   (0) A report of the election of International officers shall be
   published in the official membership publications of the International
   Union.
   
   (P) In the event of a vacancy in any office on the International
   Executive Board, other than that of the International President, the
   International President shall immediately make such vacancy known to
   the International Executive Board. The International Executive Board,
   by majority vote, may elect a successor. In filling a vacancy in the
   office of an International Vice President in Canada, the International
   Executive Board shall elect an active member who is nominated by an
   International Vice President from Canada and is a resident of Canada
   and a member of a Local Union chartered in Canada. Upon each
   unsuccessful balloting, the name of the candidate receiving the fewest
   number of votes shall be eliminated.
   
   (Q) In case of a vacancy in the office of International President, the
   International Secretary-Treasurer shall perform the duties of the
   International President until his or her successor is elected. It
   shall be the duty of the International Secretary-Treasurer to
   immediately make known such vacancy to the International Executive
   Board, which shall, within 30 days of such vacancy, by majority vote,
   elect a successor. Upon each unsuccessful balloting, the name of the
   candidate receiving the fewest number of votes shall be eliminated.
   If, during a vacancy in the office of International President, there
   is also a vacancy in the office of International Secretary-Treasurer,
   the following order of seniority shall be applicable to the
   responsibilities specified within this paragraph: the International
   Executive Vice Presidents in the order of seniority on the
   International Executive Committee or, in the event of equal seniority,
   in the order of seniority on the International Executive Board; and,
   then, the International Vice Presidents in the primary employment of
   the International Union in the order of seniority on the International
   Executive Board.
   
                                 ARTICLE 18
                                      
                           International Revenue
                                      
   (A) The operating revenue of the International Union shall be derived
   as follows:
   
   1. From a fee payable by Local Unions of $5.00 on each applicant for
   membership or reinstatement;
   
   2. From investments;
   
   3. From a monthly per capita tax payable by Local Unions on each
   active, affiliated, and nonactive member, based upon the membership on
   the last day of each month. For the period from July, 1998 through
   May, 1999, such per capita tax shall be in the amount of $8.04. For
   the period from June, 1999 through May, 2001, such per capita tax
   shall be in the amount of $8.54. For the period beginning June, 2001,
   such per capita tax shall be in the amount of $9.04, except that the
   International Executive Board shall have the authority, to the extent
   that it deems necessary, to increase such per capita tax by an
   additional amount not in excess of 504t, to be effective no earlier
   than June, 2002. Additionally, the International Executive Board shall
   also have the authority, following consultation with its professional
   advisers, to increase such per capita tax, beginning with the month of
   January, 1999, by such amounts as it deems necessary to fund any
   increases after July 1, 1998, in the costs of the plans provided for
   in Articles 27 and 28 of this Constitution;
   
   4. From a fee payable by Local Unions of $100 on each new paid-up life
   member; and
   
   5. From all other lawful sources.
   
   (B) From the monthly per capita tax on each member, $1.00 shall be
   allocated to the United Food and Commercial Workers International
   Union strike fund.
   
   (C) Where employees pay service fees or dues to a Local Union pursuant
   to agency shop, Rand formula, service fee provisions, or otherwise, a
   Local Union, in recognition of services performed by the International
   Union and in discharge of its obligations under the Constitution as a
   Local Union, shall pay to the International Union monthly service fees
   equal to the per capita tax payments otherwise due on such employees.
   Where initiation service fees are collected by a Local Union in lieu
   of regular initiation or reinstatement fees, the $5.00 fee set forth
   in Article 18(A) 1 shall be remitted to the International Union.
   
   (D) Payment of all fees and monthly per capita tax set forth in this
   Article shall be made by each Local Union and received in the office
   of the International Secretary-Treasurer no later than the tenth day
   of the month following that for which they are due. All such fee and
   monthly per capita tax payments shall be credited in the order in
   which they are owed. If all such fees and monthly per capita tax, or
   any part thereof, are not received by the tenth day of the month
   following that for which they are due, the Local Union is delinquent
   in its payment and shall be charged a late payment fee, equal to 2
   percent of that portion of the last month's fees and monthly per
   capita tax which has not been paid by the due date, and the
   International Secretary-Treasurer shall send a notice of delinquency
   by certified mail to the Local Union. If all such fees and monthly per
   capita tax, or any part thereof, are not received by the tenth day of
   the second month following that for which they are due, the Local
   Union shall be subject to such remedial or corrective action as the
   International Executive Committee may deem just and proper. A Local
   Union may appeal any such remedial or corrective action to the
   International Executive Board within 30 days, except where the
   International Executive Committee has imposed a trusteeship, in which
   case the procedures of Article 9(G) of this Constitution shall govern.
   
   (E) All Local Unions shall pay to the International Union promptly,
   when due, all financial obligations, which shall from time to time
   become due and payable under the provisions of the Constitution and
   laws of the International Union. The monthly per capita tax and fees
   set forth in this Article are the property of the International Union,
   and such funds may not be used by the Local Union for any purpose
   other than their being transferred to the International Union in
   accordance with this Article.
   
   (F) The provisions of this Article shall apply to any intermediate
   chartered body with any bargaining units and members directly
   affiliated with the intermediate chartered body, rather than with a
   Local Union. Such intermediate chartered body shall pay the per capita
   tax and fees required by this Article on the members directly
   affiliated with it and on the employees who are employed in bargaining
   units directly affiliated with it and who pay service fees or dues to
   the intermediate chartered body pursuant to agency shop, Rand formula,
   service fee provisions, or otherwise.

   (A) The International Union shall develop and maintain names, symbols,
   and marks of the Union, including the union logo, the union label, and
   the union shop identification card. It is through these names,
   symbols, and marks that the International Union and its functions,
   products, and services have been and will continue to be recognized.
   The International Union shall also copyright the content of any
   International Union publications as it deems appropriate. All such
   names, symbols, marks, and copyrights shall be the exclusive property
   of the International Union. The International Executive Board may
   prescribe rules, regulations, and standards governing the issuance,
   use, or display of all such names, symbols, marks, and copyrights.

   purposes of such chartered body, and not for the private use of any
   other entity, the name and logo of the United Food and Commercial
   Workers, and to make limited excerpts from copyrighted publications of
   the International Union. Any other use shall occur only in accordance

   time to time to issue a union shop identification card or such other
   indicia which indicates that a store, establishment, or facility is
   under an existing collective bargaining agreement with the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies. Only
   establishments recognized as Union by the laws and principles of the
   International Union may display the union shop identification card or
   other such indicia, provided the proprietor or persons duly authorized
   to conduct such establishment shall have signed a collective
   bargaining agreement with a chartered body or the International Union.
   No chartered body shall sell, rent, lease, or charge any fee for the
   union shop identification card or other such indicia.
   
   (D) The union logo, union label, or any other identification of the
   Union may be used only on products manufactured, processed, grown, or
   handled by businesses whose employees are represented by the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies. No chartered body
   shall sell, rent, lease, or charge any fee for the union logo, union
   label, or other identification of the Union, without specific
   authorization in writing from the International Executive Committee.

                       Collective Bargaining Contract
                                      
   (A) The terms of proposed collective bargaining contracts or proposals
   for renewal or any modifications of existing contracts, whether
   proposed by the employer or the Local Union, shall be submitted to the
   International President, upon his or her request, for review prior to
   any membership action thereon. Such review shall be for the purposes
   of determining whether the aforementioned terms conform to the
   applicable established policies, practices, and objectives of the
   International Union relating to wages, hours, and other working
   conditions, either in the locality involved or nationally, and
   enabling the International Union to discharge its obligations in the
   event such proposed terms are found to be injurious to the best
   interests of the membership of other Local Unions or the International
   Union. If the International President exercises his or her authority
   under this paragraph, terms of proposed collective bargaining
   contracts or proposals for renewal or any modifications of existing
   contracts shall not be submitted to the membership for its action
   pending completion of review or following any disapproval by the
   International President. Any membership action on the aforementioned
   terms or proposals pending completion of review or following any
   disapproval by the International President shall be void and without
   effect.
   
   (B) The International Union, in approving or disapproving the terms of
   a proposed collective bargaining contract as above set forth, shall
   not thereby become a party to the contract, or assume any liability
   with respect thereto, unless the International Union, following
   specific authorization of its International Executive Board, becomes a
   party to and signs such contract.
   
   (C) Local Unions shall, upon request, file executed copies of all
   collective bargaining contracts, including all letters of
   understanding, memoranda of agreement, or other addenda concerning
   such contracts, and any subsequent modifications thereof with the
   International Union.
   
   (D) 1. The affected membership may submit initial proposals for a
   collective bargaining contract or renewal of such a contract to the
   President of the Local Union involved or to a representative or
   committee designated by such President prior to the commencement of
   negotiations. Initial proposals shall be referred to the affected
   membership or a committee of the affected membership for approval, as
   directed by the President of the Local Union.
   
   2. Following the approval of such initial proposals by the affected
   membership or a committee of the affected membership, the President of
   the Local Union involved or his or her designated representative or
   committee shall meet with the employer and endeavor to arrive at an
   agreement. The current status of such meetings with the employer shall
   be reported as regularly as practical to the affected members.
   
   3. The proposal judged by the President or negotiating committee to be
   the employer's final proposal for a collective bargaining contract or
   renewal of an existing contract shall be submitted to the affected
   membership for its consideration. A majority vote of those present and
   voting shall be necessary to accept or reject the proposal.
   
   4. In the event of rejection of the employer's proposal, the President
   of the Local Union shall, upon request, report all pertinent facts to
   the International President.
   
   5. No strike or other economic action shall be taken by any Local
   Union in connection with a contract proposal, unless the affected
   membership, at a meeting or meetings thereof, has approved the same
   through a two-thirds majority vote of members voting on the action
   separately or combined with the question of approval of the contract
   proposal. In the event the affected membership constitutes less than a
   majority of the membership of the Local Union, the Local Union
   Executive Board may disapprove such strike or other economic action.
   
   6. In the event of rejection of the employer's proposal judged by the
   Local Union President or negotiating committee to be the employer's
   final proposal for a collective bargaining contract or renewal of an
   existing contract and the failure of the affected membership of the
   Local Union to approve a strike or other economic action by a
   two-thirds vote, the Local Union Executive Board shall, after
   notifying the International President and receiving acknowledgment of
   such notice, have authority to accept or reject such offer.
   
   7. The affected membership, for purposes of voting on the proposal
   judged to be the employer's final offer for a collective bargaining
   contract or contracts or renewal of an existing contract or contracts
   or on a proposal to strike or take other economic action, shall be
   either the affected membership in a single Local Union or in two or
   more Local Unions, as separately determined by the President of each
   Local Union involved prior to any such vote. Where such affected
   membership is in two or more Local Unions, the results of any such
   vote shall be determined by aggregating the votes of all the affected
   members, by a majority of the Local Unions involved based upon a
   separate vote of the affected membership of each, or separately by
   each Local Union based upon a vote of each Local Union's affected
   membership. Where the affected membership is in two or more collective
   bargaining units of the same Local Union, the results of any such vote
   shall be determined by aggregating the votes of all the affected
   members or separately by each unit based upon a vote of the affected
   membership in each unit, unless otherwise prohibited by law. The
   method of determining such results shall be separately determined by
   each Local Union President prior to any such vote.
   
   8. Adequate notice of all meetings required by Article 23(D) shall be
   given to the affected membership.
   
   9. Whenever in the judgment of the Local Union President it would be
   preferable to conduct a mail referendum for contract ratification,
   strike vote, or vote on other economic action, he or she may direct
   the conduct of such a referendum. Whenever in the judgment of the
   International Executive Committee it would be preferable to conduct a
   mail referendum for contract ratification, strike vote, or vote on
   other economic action, it may direct the conduct of such a referendum.
   Any such mail referenda shall be conducted in accordance with
   procedures established by the International President.
   
   10. Acceptance in the manner provided by the applicable provisions of
   Article 23(D) shall be required before any terms of proposed
   collective bargaining contracts or proposals for renewal or any
   modifications of existing contracts may be agreed to by the Local
   Union.
   
   11. A representative assigned by the International President to assist
   a Local Union in preparing for or arriving at a satisfactory
   collective bargaining contract, or in adjusting a dispute arising
   under a collective bargaining contract, shall perform such duties in
   conjunction with the Local Union as will assist the Local Union.
   
   (E) 1. Following approval of a strike or other economic action by the
   Local Union, the President of the Local Union shall request
   authorization from the International Executive Committee to strike or
   take other economic measures, and shall advise it of the action taken
   by the affected membership and the Local Union and submit all
   information required for strike authorization as determined by the
   International President and, upon request, any other information
   deemed necessary for facilitating disposition of such request. No
   Local Union shall engage in a strike or other economic measures
   without first receiving the authorization of the International
   Executive Committee and otherwise complying with the applicable
   provisions of this Article.
   
   2. In the event of a dispute concerning the interpretation,
   application, or enforcement of a collective bargaining contract,
   efforts shall be made by the Local Union to amicably adjust the
   dispute, pursuant to the provisions of the collective bargaining
   contract. No strike or other economic action respecting the foregoing
   shall take place without the approval of the Local Union and the
   authorization of the International Executive Committee, to whom a
   request for such approval must be directed, accompanied by all
   information required for strike authorization as determined by the
   International President and, upon request, any other information
   deemed necessary for facilitating disposition of such request.
   
   3. Any authorization by the International Union of strikes or other
   economic action taken by a Local Union shall be considered not to have
   been given if such authorization was obtained without full disclosure
   by the Local Union of the information required in Article 230.
   
   4. The strike action, or any other economic action authorized by the
   International Executive Committee, shall not constitute the
   International Union a party or a participant in any such dispute or
   impose any liability on the International Union or its officers. Such
   authorization is solely for the purpose of assuring compliance with
   the provisions of this Constitution and recognition that amicable
   means of adjustment have been exhausted and that the best interests of
   the membership have been protected. Such authorization is also a
   necessary step to obtain consideration for strike or defense benefits.
   
   (F) 1. Disbursements for strike, lockout, or defense purposes shall be
   made from the strike fund or from the general funds of the
   International Union, when authorized by the International Executive
   Committee. Disbursements, when made, shall be subject to such
   qualifications, rules, and regulations as may be deemed necessary by
   the International Executive Committee. The International Executive
   Committee is authorized to discontinue disbursements for strike,
   lockout, or defense purposes whenever the International Executive
   Committee shall so determine.
   
   2. No Local Union shall receive strike or defense benefits, unless
   strike authorization or approval for other economic action has been
   obtained from the International Executive Committee.
   
   3. The financial aid allowed shall not be payable for the first seven
   days of the strike or lockout and shall apply only to those members
   who have been on strike or locked out for fourteen days in succession.
   Only those members who are on authorized strike or who are locked out
   shall be entitled to receive such benefits, except that the
   International Executive Committee is authorized to provide for the
   payment of financial aid to members who respect authorized and
   legitimate picket lines of the International Union or any of its
   chartered bodies.
   
   4. The International Executive Committee is authorized to establish
   rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this Constitution,
   governing the payment of strike, lockout, or defense benefits.
   
   5. Each member receiving strike, lockout, or defense benefits must
   sign his or her name on forms required by the International Union.
   These forms, when so signed, must be countersigned by a Local Union
   officer and shall be sent, with all other information and documents
   required by the International Executive Committee pursuant to Article
   23(F)l and 4, to the International Secretary-Treasurer by the Local
   Union President at the close of each week.
   
   6. The payment of strike, lockout, or defense benefits under this
   Article by the International Union constitutes simply the performance
   of an obligation under circumstances when its members are involved in
   economic disputes and shall in no sense make the International Union a
   party to, or a participant in, such economic action.
   
   (G) In no event shall any owner-operator who is an active member
   pursuant to Article 4(B) 1 of this Constitution participate with any
   active members who are employees in the formulation, ratification,
   interpretation, application, or enforcement of the terms of a
   collective bargaining contract.
   
   (H) Where an intermediate chartered body or the International Union is
   a designated bargaining representative for a collective bargaining
   unit, references in this Constitution, with respect to collective
   bargaining contracts, to the Local Union, Local Union President, or
   Local Union Executive Board shall be understood to refer to the
   designated bargaining representative, its President, and its Executive
   Board or Executive Committee, as applicable.

   (A) Local Unions shall, without delay, file with the office of the
   International President executed copies of all pension and health and
   welfare trust documents, including all amendments and other pertinent
   descriptive and operational documents necessary to clearly set forth
   benefits and administrative details in effect in such trusts.
   
   (B) Local Union officers or employees, when serving as trustees of
   welfare and pension funds, shall do so as representatives of the Union
   and shall not receive any remuneration for services performed for such
   welfare and pension funds except for
   
   reasonable expenses incurred. Such Union representatives shall report
   regularly to the Local Union respecting the status of the trust fund
   and all matters pertaining thereto.

   (A) Every member of this International Union agrees, in consideration
   of the rights and benefits conferred pursuant to the terms of this
   Constitution, to comply with the duties and obligations stated in this
   Article and that termination of membership shall not terminate
   liability for violations of such duties and obligations occurring
   during the period of his or her membership.
   
   (B) No member may be disciplined, except for violating his or her
   duties and obligations by committing any one or more of the following
   offenses:
   
   1. Violating any provisions of the Constitution or laws of the
   International Union or the approved bylaws or established rules of the
   member's Local Union;

   obligations in a timely manner;
   
   3. Obtaining membership through fraudulent means or by
   misrepresentation;
   
   4. Advocating or attempting to bring about the withdrawal from the
   International Union of any Local Union or any member or group of
   members;
   
   5. Working in the interest of or accepting membership in any
   organization dual to the International Union;
   
   6. Unreasonably, unlawfully, or improperly disturbing the conduct of
   any meeting of the International Union or any chartered body, or the
   operations of any of their offices;
   
   7. Embezzling, misappropriating, fraudulently receiving, wrongfully
   handling, or failing to account for the funds of the International
   Union, a Local Union, or any employee benefit fund;
   
   8. Using the name of any Local Union or the International Union for
   soliciting funds or advertising or similar activities except as
   provided in Article 32(B);
   
   9. Furnishing a complete or partial list of the membership of the
   International Union or of any Local Union to any person other than
   those whose governmental position or International or Local Union
   office or employee benefit fund position entitles them to have a list,
   without specific authorization in writing from the International
   President;
   
   10. Deliberately and improperly interfering with any officer or
   representative of the International Union or any Local Union in the
   discharge of his or her duties;
   
   11. Deliberately engaging in conduct in violation of the

   12. Crossing or working behind a legal picket line established by a
   United Food and Commercial Workers Local Union and sanctioned by the
   United Food and Commercial Workers International Union;
   
   13. Crossing or working behind a legal picket line established by a
   union other than the United Food and Commercial Workers International
   Union, provided such picket line has the sanction of the Executive
   Board of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local Union in whose
   jurisdiction it is established, and, provided further, the United Food
   and Commercial Workers Local Union has notified its membership of such
   sanction;
   
   14. Deliberately interfering with the performance of the legal or
   contractual rights or obligations of the International Union or any of

   (C) Any member may be charged, tried, and disciplined for violation of
   any of the above offenses, or for offenses set forth in the Local
   Union bylaws, in accordance with the procedures provided for in this
   Constitution.
   
   (D) Elected and appointed representatives of the International Union
   and its Local Unions serve in a position of trust and responsibility
   and obtain information and confidences and develop abilities which
   should not be employed in a manner injurious to the best interests of
   the International Union or its Local Unions; therefore, all such
   representatives, in the event of termination for any reason
   whatsoever, assume the obligation not to seek or obtain employment or
   position or work with, or in, any dual or other organization

   from termination and extends to such geographical areas as may be
   necessary to protect the International Union or any of its Local
   Unions. This provision shall in no respect be applied in derogation or
   limitation of any rights provided for under the United Food and
   Commercial Workers International Union Pension Plan for Employees or
   the United Food and Commercial Workers Health Insurance Plan for
   Retirees.
   
   (E) 1. Every dispute relating to the interpretation or application of
   the Local Union bylaws or rules or the Constitution or laws of the

   International Union, Local Union, or any of their officers or
   representatives without first exhausting all remedies provided by the
   Local Union bylaws and rules and the Constitution and laws of the
   International Union.
   
   (F) "Local Union" as used in this Article shall apply, where
   appropriate, to intermediate chartered bodies.

                    Disciplinary Proceedings and Appeals
                                      
   (A) 1. A member shall be charged and tried in the Local Union through
   which he or she is a member at the time the charges are filed, except
   as otherwise provided in this Constitution. Any person no longer a
   member may be charged and tried in the Local Union through which he or
   she last held membership for actions committed while he or she was a
   member.
   
   2. Charges may be filed by an active member of the Local Union through
   which the accused is a member, or, where the accused is no longer a
   member, by an active member of the Local Union through which the
   accused was a member at the time of the alleged violation, or by a
   representative of the International Union.
   
   3. More than one charging party may join in the same set of charges,
   but the charges must name one of the charging parties as the
   representative of the others to be responsible for filing papers,
   receiving papers, and trying the case. Where the charges fail to
   designate such representative, then the first charging member named in
   the charge shall be considered the representative of the others.
   
   4. Charges and other formal documents referred to in Article 26 sent
   by mail or submitted in another generally accepted manner other than
   in person shall be considered filed as of the date of postmark or
   other indicia of transmission. Charges and other formal documents
   referred to in Article 26 delivered in person shall be considered
   filed as of the date of delivery.
   
   5. Charges shall be filed with the Local Union Executive Board within
   six months after the basis for the alleged violation has been
   discovered or should have been discovered.
   
   6. The charges shall specify the Article or Articles of the
   International Constitution or laws or the Local Union bylaws or rules
   allegedly violated and shall also set forth a short and plain factual
   statement of the act or acts considered to be in violation, including
   available information as to dates and places, in such a manner as to
   fairly inform the accused of the specific acts which are alleged to
   constitute violations of the International Constitution or laws or the
   Local Union bylaws or rules. Either upon motion by the charged parties
   or the Local Union Executive Board, charges failing to comply -with
   this requirement shall be dismissed by the Local Union Executive
   Board, without prejudice to the refilling of charges within ten days
   which do comply with this requirement. Dismissal of refilled charges
   shall constitute final action, subject to appeal as provided in
   Article 26(C).
   
   7. A true and correct copy of the charges and a copy of the
   Constitution and Local Union bylaws shall, without delay, be served
   upon the accused party by the Local Union Executive Board by certified
   mail, return receipt requested, or in person. The accused shall be
   afforded a reasonable opportunity to reply in writing to the charges,
   if he or she so desires.
   
   8. On motion of the accused before trial, or upon its own motion, the
   Local Union Executive Board may dismiss without trial any charges
   which, after assuming the charging party's facts are true, fail to
   allege actions which would constitute violations of the International
   Constitution or laws or the Local Union bylaws or rules. Such
   dismissal shall be subject to appeal as provided in Article 26(C).
   
   9. On motion of the accused before trial, or upon its own motion, the
   Local Union Executive Board may dismiss without trial any charges it
   finds are of such a nature that the interest of the Local Union does
   not justify the expenditure of time, money, and other resources
   necessary for the conduct of a disciplinary proceeding or where it
   finds that the undisputed material facts warrant dismissal of the
   charges. Such dismissal shall be subject to appeal as provided in
   Article 26(C).
   
   10. Except for charges processed pursuant to Article 26(A) 16, the
   trial on the charges shall be held as soon as practicable, but no
   later than 60 days following the date on which the charges are filed.
   However, upon request of either party, for good cause shown, an
   adjournment to a later date, not to exceed 100 days from the date the
   charges are filed, may be granted by the Local Union Executive Board.
   The Local Union Executive Board shall have the power, upon its own
   motion, to postpone any scheduled trial, provided such postponement
   shall not be beyond 100 days from the date the charges are filed. Any
   such Executive Board decision to postpone the trial beyond the
   scheduled date or to set a trial for 60 days beyond the date of the
   charges being filed must be served upon all parties immediately. Every
   effort shall be made to schedule the trial so that it does not
   conflict with the working schedule of the parties, and at least 14
   days' notice of the trial date shall be given in writing. The written
   notice to the charging and accused parties shall state that the
   parties have the right to have other members of the Local Union attend
   the trial, subject to reasonable accommodations of space. Any request
   for the postponement of the trial date must be received by the
   Executive Board at least three days before the scheduled trial date
   unless a satisfactory showing is made of inability to comply with this
   requirement. The request must include good cause for such a
   postponement. In the event the accused fails to appear for a duly
   noticed trial, it shall nevertheless proceed.
   
   11. The trial shall take place before the Local Union Executive Board,
   which for purposes of Article 26 shall mean those members of the Local
   Union Executive Board serving for purposes of trial. The President of
   the Local Union shall be the chairperson of the Executive Board for
   purposes of the trial proceeding. No charging party or accused member
   or a witness may serve on the Executive Board in the conduct of
   disciplinary proceedings. Where the chairperson is unable to serve for
   any reason, the remaining members of the Local Union Executive Board
   shall designate one of their number to act as chairperson. On motion
   filed with the Local Union Executive Board, prior to trial, either
   party may ask that a particular Board member be excused from
   participating in the proceeding if he or she thinks that he or she
   cannot receive a fair trial before that Board member. The Executive
   Board shall give precedence to consideration of such motion. For
   purposes of trial, a quorum of the Executive Board shall consist of
   three of its members, and a quorum is necessary throughout the trial.
   If an Executive Board member is absent during any portion of the
   trial, he or she may not participate further in the proceeding. All
   questions of order, procedure, and admissibility of evidence shall be
   decided by the chairperson, subject to being overruled by a majority
   vote of the Board upon motion by a member of the Board.
   
   12. The accused and charging parties shall have a fair and impartial
   trial and shall have the right to present witnesses and other evidence
   in their behalf and to examine any witnesses. The accused shall have
   the right to refuse to testify. A charging or accused member may be
   assisted, advised, or represented by another member of the Local
   Union. At the commencement of the trial, the chairperson of the Board
   shall advise the parties of their rights as set forth above in this
   Article, and shall read the charges to the accused. The accused shall
   then plead guilty or not guilty to each charge. In the event the
   accused elects not to appear or to respond, he or she shall be deemed
   to have entered a plea of not guilty and the trial shall proceed.
   Throughout the trial, there shall be a presumption of innocence in
   favor of the accused. The charging party shall present his or her case
   first and shall have the burden of proving the allegations contained
   in the charge. At the close of the charging party's case, either the
   accused or a member of the Executive Board shall have the right to
   move to dismiss the charges because the charging party has failed to
   present record evidence that establishes a violation of the
   International Constitution or laws or the Local Union bylaws or rules.
   
   13. A detailed written record of the trial proceedings shall be made
   and preserved and shall constitute the trial record, provided that no
   fine, nor loss of membership rights or Union office, shall be imposed
   unless a stenographic record and transcript are kept of the trial
   proceedings.
   
   14. Upon the completion of the trial proceedings, the Executive Board
   shall, within 45 days, determine the innocence or guilt of the
   accused, based solely on the record evidence. The parties shall be
   advised of the decision in person or by certified mail. A verdict of
   guilty shall require a two-thirds majority vote of the Executive
   Board. If the decision is that of guilty, the Executive Board shall
   affix appropriate penalties in accordance with the provisions of the
   Constitution. Any member found guilty of any one or more of the
   charges against him or her may be censured, fined, suspended, and/or
   expelled, provided that such discipline shall be reasonable and fair,
   and, provided further, that no discipline shall be imposed without
   stating with specificity what the discipline is being imposed for. If
   any officer or representative of the International Union or any of its
   chartered bodies is found guilty, he or she may be disciplined as
   provided in this paragraph and, in addition, may be suspended or
   removed from office or position, subject to the conditions above;
   provided that, if the Local Union Executive Board's decision is to
   remove an officer of the Local Union, the officer may appeal the
   decision to the membership within 15 days from the date the adverse
   ruling is delivered to the officer, in which case, the membership
   shall be sent not less than 15 days' written notice of a membership
   meeting, which shall be held within 40 days of the Executive Board's
   decision and at which the members shall vote by secret ballot whether
   to remove the officer, subject to appeal pursuant to the applicable
   provisions of Article 26(C). If charges alleging serious misconduct
   have been filed against an officer of the Local Union and, following
   trial by the Local Union Executive Board, the officer is found
   innocent, or the officer is found guilty but removal from office is
   not imposed as discipline, the Executive Board shall announce the
   decision at the next membership meeting following the exhaustion of
   appeal rights or, within 30 days following said exhaustion, provide
   other reasonable notice to the membership indicating that charges were
   filed against the officer and giving the date of the trial and the
   Executive Board's verdict.
   
   15. The decision of the Executive Board shall become immediately
   operative unless stayed by the Local Union Executive Board or unless a
   stay is directed by the International President following an appeal as
   set forth in Article 26(C).
   
   16. Where it appears to the International President that a fair and
   impartial trial cannot be held before the Local Union Executive Board,
   the International President is authorized to appoint not more than six
   members from outside the Local Union to conduct the trial. The trial
   board so selected shall hear the matter within 150 days from the
   filing of the charge in accordance with the provisions of this
   Constitution as far as they are applicable and render judgment thereon
   as soon as practicable. The parties shall be advised of the decision
   by certified mail.
   
   17. Decisions rendered pursuant to Article 26(A) 16 shall become
   immediately operative unless a stay is directed by the International
   President following an appeal as set forth in Article 26(C).
   
   (B) 1. All charges against International officers in their capacity as
   representatives of the International Union shall be filed with and
   tried by the International Executive Board in accordance with
   procedures set forth in Article 26(A) as far as they are applicable,
   and all decisions of the International Executive Board shall be
   immediately effective, unless a stay is directed by the International
   Executive Board following an appeal to the next regular International
   Convention as set forth in Article 26(B)2. The International President
   shall be empowered to direct that all charges filed against
   International representatives be tried by the International Executive
   Board in the same manner. In case of such charges, the International
   Executive Committee shall have the power to suspend the charged
   officer or International representative prior to trial.
   
   2. An International officer or representative who has been found
   guilty of any offense pursuant to a trial by the International
   Executive Board, or the charging party when the accused has been
   acquitted, may appeal to the next regular International Convention for
   redress. Any such appeal to the Convention shall be filed with the
   International Secretary-Treasurer within 30 days from the date the
   adverse ruling is delivered to the appealing party.
   
   (C) 1. A member who has been found guilty of any offense as herein set
   forth or the charging party when the accused has been acquitted, may
   appeal to the International President for redress, subject to a
   further appeal to the International Executive Board.
   
   2. A notice of appeal to the International President shall be filed no
   later than 15 days from the date the adverse ruling is delivered to
   the appealing party; however, the International President, for good
   cause shown, may extend the time within which a notice of appeal may
   be filed. A notice of appeal must briefly state why the party believes
   the decision should be reversed.
   
   3. When an appeal is taken, the International President shall send a
   copy of the notice of appeal to the Local Union Executive Board
   involved and to the other party. Thereafter, the Local Union Executive
   Board shall immediately transmit a full and complete copy of the trial
   record and charges, together with all other pertinent documents, to
   the International President, and it shall immediately transmit a full
   and complete copy of the trial record to the appealing party and the
   other party in the case.
   
   4. The appealing party may file a written statement in support of his
   or her appeal with the International President, stating wherein the
   decision being appealed is erroneous, within 40 days from the date the
   trial record is sent to the appealing party by the Local Union. The
   International President shall mail a copy of any such written
   statement to the other party. The other party may, within 30 days
   after such written statement has been sent to him or her, file a
   responsive statement. A request for an extension of the time limit set
   out herein must be filed with the International President before the
   expiration of the time limit in question, and the International
   President can, for good cause shown, extend the time limits.
   
   5. The International President shall have authority to obtain any
   additional information in such form as he or she may prescribe from
   all parties concerned, in the event he or she believes such additional
   information is necessary in order to give full consideration to the
   appeal.
   
   6. Upon failure of any party to comply with the foregoing
   requirements, the International President shall have the power to
   decide the appeal on the papers before him or her, and the party
   failing to discharge its obligations as set forth above shall forfeit
   all further right of appeal from the action of the International
   President. After all statements have been or could have been filed,
   the International President shall consider the appeal and render a
   decision within three months of the date that all statements have been
   or could have been filed, unless the International President
   determines that the issues are of such complexity or the appeals
   pending are so numerous as to warrant an extension to four months, or
   unless both the charging and accused parties agree to an extension of
   time. The International President shall give his or her reasons for
   the decision in writing, a copy of which shall be mailed to each party
   and the Local Union Executive Board.
   
   7. Either party may appeal from the decision of the International
   President to the International Executive Board by filing a written
   notice of appeal with the International Secretary-Treasurer within 30
   days of the date the decision has been mailed. The notice of appeal
   must briefly state why the party believes the International
   President's decision should be reversed, and it may also contain a
   more complete statement setting out wherein said decision is
   erroneous.
   
   8. The International Secretary-Treasurer shall immediately acknowledge
   receipt of the appeal and shall make available the charges, together
   with the trial record and all other records pertinent to the appeal,
   to the International Executive Board for review. The International
   Secretary-Treasurer shall immediately send a copy of the appeal to the
   involved Local Union Executive Board and the other parties.
   
   9. The other party may, within 30 days after the appealing party's
   notice of appeal has been sent to him or her by the International
   Secretary-Treasurer, file a responsive statement. It shall be the duty
   of the International Secretary-Treasurer to send a copy of any
   statement so filed to the appealing party and the Local Union
   Executive Board immediately after it has been filed in his or her
   office.
   
   10. After the statements have been or could have been filed, the
   International Executive Board shall proceed to consider such appeal at
   its next regular meeting, unless both the charging and accused parties
   agree to an extension of time, and either affirm or reverse the
   decision of the International President. The International Executive
   Board shall give its reasons for the decision in writing, a copy of
   which shall be sent to each party and the Local Union Executive Board
   involved. Issues which were not raised before the International
   President may be considered by the International Executive Board in
   its sole discretion.

                                Pension Plan
                                      
   (A) The International Union shall maintain the pension plan and trust
   known as the "United Food and Commercial Workers International Union
   Pension Plan for Employees" and any spin-off or successor plans and
   trusts (hereinafter in this Article referred to as "the Plan"),
   covering eligible officers and employees of the International Union
   and its chartered bodies.
   
   (B) The Plan shall be funded by the contributions of the Plan
   participants as may be provided for in the Plan documents and by
   allocation of such portion of the International per capita tax as may
   be necessary to fund the pension benefits provided for in the Plan.
   The amount of such allocation shall be determined by the International
   Executive Board after consultation with the Plan's actuaries. No
   contributions of the International Union may revert to it or its
   chartered bodies except upon satisfaction of all the Plan liabilities
   and in accordance with the terms of the Plan and applicable laws and
   regulations.
   
   (C) The International Executive Committee shall be responsible for the
   general administration of the Plan.
   
   (D) The Plan may be amended in the same manner as the International
   Constitution provides for amendments to the Constitution, except that
   the Plan may be amended by a majority vote of a quorum of the
   International Executive Committee in cases where it deems an amendment
   necessary to qualify the Plan for tax exempt status or to maximize tax
   advantages to Plan participants, to conform to laws and regulations
   applicable to the Plan, and, within the limits of its fiduciary
   responsibility, to make improvements in the Plan or to administer the
   Plan. Such improvements shall be made after the International
   Executive Committee has obtained for such purposes such professional
   advice as it shall determine is necessary including, but not limited
   to, the advice of the Plan's actuaries.
   
                                 ARTICLE 28
                                      
                            Retiree Health Plan
                                      
   (A) 1. All persons who are eligible to receive pension benefits under
   the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Pension
   Plan for Employees and any spin-off or successor plans (hereinafter in
   this Article referred to as "the Pension Plan") and who have actually
   retired shall, subject to the conditions set forth in this Article and
   in the United Food and Commercial Workers Health Insurance Plan for
   Retirees (hereinafter in this Article referred to as "the Retiree
   Health Plan"), receive such retiree health and welfare benefits as are
   provided under the Retiree Health Plan.
   
   2. Salaried officers and employees of the International Union and of
   its chartered bodies shall be eligible to receive retiree health and
   welfare benefits upon their actual retirement under the Plan, provided
   that they have met the eligibility requirements set forth in this
   Article and in the Retiree Health Plan.
   
   (B) The cost of providing retiree health and welfare benefits to
   eligible and actually retired salaried officers and employees shall be
   borne principally by the International Union.
   
   (C) 1. Salaried officers and employees who have actually retired and
   who are eligible for retiree health and welfare benefits shall remain
   eligible for benefits under the Retiree Health Plan so long as they
   are eligible to continue to receive pension benefits under the Pension
   Plan.
   
   2. Participants in the Pension Plan who are permitted to continue
   their participation during an authorized leave of absence in the
   manner provided in the Pension Plan may be eligible to receive retiree
   health and welfare benefits upon their actual retirement, subject to
   conditions set forth in such rules and regulations as may be
   promulgated from time to time by the International Executive
   Committee.
   
   (D) Surviving spouses and dependents (as defined by the International
   Executive Committee) of retired officers and employees who had
   satisfied the applicable eligibility requirements of the Retiree
   Health Plan or of officers and employees who had no less than 10 years
   of service under the Pension Plan shall be entitled to retiree health
   and welfare benefits according to the terms and conditions of the
   Retiree Health Plan.
   
   (E) Actually retired under this Article shall mean that the officer or
   employee is currently receiving pension benefits from the Pension Plan
   and has left employment with the International Union, any of its
   predecessor unions, or a chartered body.
   
   (F) The International Executive Committee shall administer the Retiree
   Health Plan and shall be empowered to establish and provide retiree
   health and welfare benefits and make such changes and modifications
   therein as it deems reasonable; to issue interpretations and
   regulations governing the operation of such plan; to administer such
   plan either separately or as integrated in an appropriate way with the
   United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Health and
   Welfare Plan for Employees; and to do all other things which are
   reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Article,
   including amending such plan or changing its specifications to conform
   to changes in the law; except that any changes and modifications which
   the International Executive Committee, following consultation with its
   professional advisers, has determined would significantly alter the
   Retiree Health Plan's benefit design, or any changes in eligibility
   requirements for receipt of retiree health and welfare benefits, shall
   be authorized or ratified by the International Executive Board. Any
   eligibility change authorized or ratified by the International
   Executive Board shall apply only to those individuals who become new
   participants in the Pension Plan after the effective date of said
   change.
   
                                 ARTICLE 29
                                      
      Honorary Officers, Other Retired Officers, and Retired Employees
                                      
   (A) In recognition of the contribution of International Presidents and
   International Secretary-Treasurers to the growth and progress of the
   International Union, International Presidents and International
   Secretary-Treasurers who retire or have retired while serving in
   either of those offices shall be honored with the title of
   International President Emeritus or International Secretary-Treasurer
   Emeritus. They shall constitute the honorary officers of the
   International Union.
   
   (B) In a similar spirit of recognition, a Local Union may express
   appreciation to its Presidents or Secretary-Treasurers who retire or
   have retired while serving in either of those offices by conferring a
   similar honor, as may be authorized by and in accordance with the
   Local Union's bylaws. Those upon whom this honor is conferred shall
   constitute the honorary officers of their Local Unions.
   
   (C) No officer or employee of the International Union or its chartered
   bodies receiving pension benefits from the United Food and Commercial
   Workers International Union Pension Plan for Employees, other than
   pension benefits that must commence as a result of applicable law,
   shall perform any services for the International Union or its
   chartered bodies or represent them in any capacity, except upon
   temporary assignment after due authorization and in a capacity not
   involving duties of a continuing nature, subject to the approval of
   the International Executive Committee.
   
                                 ARTICLE 30
                                      
                       Intermediate Chartered Bodies
                                      
   (A) The International Executive Board shall have exclusive authority
   to establish intermediate chartered bodies, such as regional, state,
   provincial, district, and trades councils, state associations, and
   regional and joint boards, to which Local Unions shall affiliate.
   Affiliation with an intermediate chartered body shall be mandatory for
   all Local Unions determined by the International Executive Board to be
   within the jurisdiction of such intermediate chartered body, unless
   otherwise directed by the International Executive Board. Such
   intermediate chartered bodies shall be subject to the Constitution and
   laws of the International Union and shall be chartered for such
   geographical area, trade, or appropriate grouping as the International
   Executive Board may from time to time direct. Charters issued by the
   International Executive Board for such bodies shall be subject to the
   direction and control of and revocation by the International Executive
   Board. Should any dispute arise as to the jurisdiction of an
   intermediate chartered body, it shall be decided by the International
   President, in consultation with the International Secretary-Treasurer,
   subject to an appeal to the International Executive Board, except as
   provided in Article 8(F).
   
   (B) 1. Intermediate chartered bodies shall adopt and amend bylaws for
   their government as they deem appropriate, provided they conform to
   the Constitution and laws of the International Union and are approved
   by the International President. Regardless of approval, if any
   conflict should arise between such bylaws and the Constitution and
   laws of the International Union, or interpretations of either, such
   Constitution, laws, or interpretations shall control. In approving
   bylaws and bylaw amendments, the International President shall have
   the authority to make such modifications in the bylaws or bylaw
   amendments as required to conform them to the provisions of the
   Constitution and laws of the International Union and the requirements
   of law. Any intermediate chartered body aggrieved by the approval of
   or failure to approve its bylaws or amendments to its bylaws may
   appeal to the International Executive Board.
   
   2. Bylaws of intermediate chartered bodies shall provide for the
   collection of a per capita tax from the Local Unions affiliated with
   the body; for the holding of a Convention, which shall meet at least
   every four years; for the establishment of an Executive Board, which
   shall meet at least annually; for the election of a President, who
   shall be the chief executive officer, a Secretary-Treasurer, at least
   two Vice Presidents, a Recorder, and such other officers as the bodies
   may deem appropriate. Unless otherwise provided in approved bylaws,
   the term of all intermediate chartered body offices shall be four
   years. In the event applicable law allows a term longer than four
   years, the body may amend its bylaws to provide for such longer term.
   Bylaw amendments establishing terms of office shall be effective for
   the next election after their adoption.
   
   (C) The duties and responsibilities of intermediate chartered bodies,
   their elected and appointed representatives, and their members under
   the Constitution and laws of the International Union shall be the same
   as those of Local Unions, their elected and appointed representatives,
   and their members; and all procedures applicable to Local Unions and
   their representatives and members shall be applicable to intermediate
   chartered bodies and their representatives and members, except where
   the International Executive Board determines that such duties,
   responsibilities, and procedures are incompatible with the purposes of
   such bodies.
   
                                 ARTICLE 31
                                      
                            Local Union Charters
                                      
   (A) Seven or more persons who are eligible to active membership in
   this International Union, as specified in this Constitution, may make
   application for a charter to the International Secretary-Treasurer.
   The International Union shall issue charters duly signed and sealed by
   the International President and International Secretary-Treasurer upon
   the joint approval of the International President and the
   International Secretary-Treasurer. A newly chartered Local Union that
   was an organization prior to its chartering by this International
   Union shall be exempt from the payment of the fee required by Article
   18(A) 1 on all members of the organization as of the date of the
   chartering. The International President, in consultation with the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, shall determine the jurisdiction of
   Local Unions and may modify the jurisdiction of Local Unions from time
   to time, subject to an appeal to the International Executive Board.
   The International Executive Board may waive the application of any
   provision of this Constitution for a period not to exceed the first
   full term of office following the date the charter is issued where
   such waiver is necessary to effectuate the chartering.
   
   (B) Where a charter is applied for within the jurisdiction of an
   existing Local Union, it shall not be issued until the existing Local
   Union has had an opportunity to present its views to the International
   President and International Secretary-Treasurer. The decision of the
   International President and International Secretary-Treasurer to
   grant, to modify, or not to grant such charter shall be final, subject
   to an appeal to the International Executive Board.
   
   (C) No Local Union shall entertain a resolution to dissolve or to
   withdraw from or surrender its charter to the International Union
   unless notice that such resolution is to be entertained is mailed to
   each member of the Local Union by certified mail at least 60 days
   prior to the regular meeting at which such resolution is to be acted
   upon. Such resolution shall be read at the regular meeting prior to
   the regular meeting at which such resolution shall be entertained. At
   least 60 days prior to the regular meeting at which such resolution is
   to be entertained, notification by certified mail that such resolution
   has been proposed shall be given to the International President by the
   President of the Local Union. The vote at such meeting shall be
   conducted by secret ballot. A Local Union cannot withdraw from the
   International Union, dissolve, or surrender its charter so long as
   seven or more active members object thereto. Notwithstanding any of
   the foregoing, or any other provision of the International
   Constitution, the Local Unions chartered in Canada may withdraw from
   the International Union as a body in the manner provided for by the
   International Executive Board.
   
   (D) If a Local Union has fewer than seven active members for each of
   three consecutive months, the International Executive Committee, after
   the issuance of a direction to such Local Union to show cause why it
   should not be dissolved and consideration of any response, may
   dissolve the Local Union.
   
   (E) If the International Executive Committee shall determine that any
   Local Union is defunct, dissolved, or withdrawn, or if it expels a
   Local Union, it shall direct that all assets, property, books, and
   records held in the name of or on behalf of such Local Union, along
   with the Local Union's charter, be delivered immediately to the
   International Secretary-Treasurer, or his or her designated
   representative. Such charter shall be canceled and such assets,
   property, books, and records shall be held in safekeeping by the
   International Union for a period of one year. If such Local Union
   shall be reorganized during that period, such assets, property, books,
   and records shall be returned to the Local Union with a reissued
   charter by the International Union. If no such reorganization occurs,
   such assets, property, books, and records shall, without further
   proceedings, become the property of the International Union. The
   officers and members of such Local Union shall be responsible for
   compliance with this Article within 30 days of such determination
   under penalty of being prosecuted by law, or forfeiture of membership
   and benefit in this International Union, or both.
   
   (F) Members of defunct, withdrawn, dissolved, or expelled Local Unions
   shall be transferred to such Local Union as may be directed by the
   International Executive Committee. Such transfer shall become
   effective immediately.

                       Local Union Duties and Powers
                                      
   (A) 1. Local Unions shall adopt bylaws, which shall in no way conflict
   with the Constitution and laws of the International Union, or
   interpretations of either. Bylaws and bylaw amendments properly
   adopted by the membership or as required by the Constitution must be
   filed with and approved by the International President to be
   effective. In approving bylaws and bylaw amendments, the International
   President shall have the authority to make such modifications in the
   bylaws or bylaw amendments as are required to conform them to the
   provisions of the Constitution and laws of the International Union and
   the requirements of law. Regardless of such approval, if any conflict

   Constitution, laws, or interpretations shall control, subject to an
   appeal to the International Executive Board.

   or 400 members, whichever is greater, shall be required, or (2) be
   proposed by the Local Union Executive Board. The Executive Board shall
   make a recommendation on amendments submitted to it not later than 90
   days after they are submitted. Notice of such amendment, containing
   the Executive Board's recommendation thereon and the date, time, and
   location of the membership meeting at which the amendment will be
   voted upon, shall be mailed to each member at least 15 days prior to
   such meeting. The text of the amendment and the Executive Board's
   recommendation shall be read or distributed to the membership at such
   meeting prior to voting. Amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds
   majority vote of active members voting. At the discretion of the Local
   Union Executive Board, the vote may be conducted by mail referendum in
   accordance with the applicable provisions of this paragraph, provided
   that the Local Union shall mail members their ballots and the proposed
   amendment at least 15 days prior to the receipt deadline for return of
   the ballots and that the Local Union shall hold an informational
   meeting for discussion of the proposed amendment.

   approval of the International President, subject to an appeal to the
   International Executive Board. Local Unions shall not seek or solicit
   funds or advertising using the name of the International Union or
   otherwise implying the endorsement of the International Union, unless
   the activity which is the subject of the solicitation has been
   approved by the International Union, or authorize the use of the name
   of the International Union other than as provided in Article 20, and
   members of Local Unions shall not seek or solicit funds or advertising
   using the name of the International Union or any Local Union or
   otherwise implying the endorsement of the International Union or any
   Local Union, except with the approval of the International President,
   subject to an appeal to the International Executive Board.

   President, with the approval of the International Executive Board.
   
   (E) When State and Local Central Bodies or appropriate Departments of
   the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
   Organizations and Provincial Federations of Labour and Labour Councils

   of such a membership request, the Local Union President may defer such
   requested meeting to the date of the regularly scheduled meeting. A
   special meeting shall also be called when directed by the Local Union
   Executive Board or President. Special meetings shall be held in the
   same manner as the Local Union holds its regular meetings.
   
   (C) Local Unions may hold informational meetings of a portion of their
   membership on an occasional or regular basis as may be determined by
   the Local Union. Such informational meetings of the Local Union

                                 ARTICLE 35
                                      
                           Local Union Elections
                                      
   (A) An active member in the Local Union, who has been an active member
   in the Local Union, or who had been a member of another organization
   merged with the Local Union, for a continuous aggregate of at least 12
   months immediately preceding the month in which nominations are held,
   or an active member in the Local Union who has been an active member
   in the International Union continuously for at least 24 months
   immediately preceding the month in which nominations are held, shall
   be eligible to hold any Local Union office, provided that said member
   maintains continuous active membership in the Local Union.
   
   (B) The constitutional officers of the Local Union shall be elected as
   provided in Article 35(C); and unless otherwise provided in the Local
   Union's bylaws, the term of all offices shall be three years. In the
   event applicable law allows a term longer than three years, the Local
   Union may amend its bylaws to provide for such longer term. Bylaw
   amendments establishing terms of office shall be effective following
   the next election after their adoption. Terms of office shall expire
   on December 31, unless the Local Union's bylaws provide that they
   shall expire on the last day of another month.
   
   (C) 1. Nominations shall be conducted during the six-month period
   preceding the expiration of the term of office. Not less than 15 days
   prior to nominations, notice shall be mailed by the Local Union to
   each member at his or her last known home address, setting forth the

   the expiration of the term of office, as provided in the Local Union's
   bylaws. Not less than 15 days prior to elections, notice shall be
   mailed by the Local Union to each member at his or her last known home
   address, setting forth the times, dates, and places for conducting the
   election. The elections shall be conducted at such times and places as
   will afford all active members a reasonable opportunity to vote. If
   the Local Union members are so widely dispersed that they must travel
   an unreasonable distance to vote at a single polling place, the Local
   Union shall provide for multiple polling places. Any active member in
   the Local Union, as defined in Article 4(B) of this Constitution,
   shall be eligible to vote in the Local Union's elections.
   
   3. Notice of nominations and election may be combined into a single

   Board.
   
   5. The Local Union President shall select a general chairperson, who
   shall be a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers, to
   supervise the conduct of the nominations and election and not less
   than three members to act as election judges to assist the general
   chairperson. The general chairperson and election judges, who together
   shall constitute the election committee, shall not be candidates for
   Local Union office. The general chairperson shall establish the
   applicable dates, times, places, manner, and procedures for the
   nominations and election. The election committee shall maintain
   custody of all ballots and election registers during the conduct of
   the elections. Where multiple polling places are used, at least one
   election judge or the general chairperson shall supervise the election
   at each polling place.
   
   6. Each eligible member desiring to vote shall sign an election
   register authorized by the general chairperson of the election. The
   voter shall be given a ballot authorized by the general chairperson
   and shall be provided an opportunity to vote his or her ballot in
   secrecy. Ballots shall bear no number or marks which might identify
   the voter. After marking his or her ballot, the voter shall fold and
   place it in a secured ballot receptacle provided by the election
   committee. Alternative procedures for voting by machine, adequate to
   ensure the secrecy of the ballot, may be provided. Candidates may have
   observers, who shall be active members of the Local Union. Adequate
   safeguards to ensure a fair election shall be provided by the Local
   Union officers and election officials.
   
   7. Where the election is conducted at a single polling place, the
   results shall be tallied and recorded by the general chairperson of
   the election and the election judges at the close of the voting.
   
   8. Where the election is conducted at multiple times or polling
   places, the general chairperson of the election and not less than
   three election judges designated by the general chairperson shall meet
   not later than the second day following the last day on which the
   election was held and at a time and place to be specified by the
   general chairperson to tally and record the results of the election.
   As may be determined by the general chairperson prior to the
   balloting, the ballots may be counted at the close of each polling
   place, provided that, the general chairperson or at least one election
   judge is present, and provided further that the general chairperson
   and not less than three election judges designated by the general
   chairperson shall tally and record the final results of the election
   as provided above in this paragraph.
   
   9. The general chairperson of the election may determine to conduct
   the election by a mail referendum in its entirety or in outlying areas
   in lieu of or in addition to the election procedures specified in
   Article 35(C). If a mail referendum is conducted, members shall be
   provided with two envelopes for returning mail ballots, one of which
   shall be a secret ballot envelope with no identifying number or marks,
   and the other of which shall be a ballot return envelope which shall
   be preaddressed to a post office box used solely for the purpose of
   the mail referendum and which shall either contain a label with the
   member's name and address or clearly ask the member to print his or
   her name and address. The general chairperson shall establish a
   deadline for the receipt of return mail ballots, which shall be no
   earlier than 15 days or later than 30 days after the date upon which
   the ballots are mailed to the members; provided that, if separate
   notice setting forth the manner and the dates that the ballots will be
   sent to the membership and that the return mail ballots must be
   received has not previously been mailed to each member at his or her
   last known home address, the receipt deadline shall be no earlier than
   20 days after the date upon which the ballots are mailed to the
   members. On the day of the receipt deadline, after 12:00 noon, at
   least two members of the election committee shall together pick up the
   mail ballots and return them unopened to the place specified by the
   general chairperson, and thereupon the election committee shall open
   and count the ballots. If only a portion of the election is conducted
   by mail ballot, the receipt deadline shall be within the limits
   provided above and, in addition, the same as the date established for
   the close of voting in the non-mail portion of the election, and the
   election committee shall open and count the mail ballots following the
   close of voting in the non-mail portion that day. Adequate safeguards
   to ensure the secrecy of each voter's ballot and the fairness of the
   mail referendum shall be provided by the Local Union officers and
   election officials.
   
   10. Write-in candidates and proxy voting shall not be permitted.
   
   11. A plurality of votes cast shall be required for election, except
   as to the offices of Local Union President and Secretary-Treasurer,
   where a majority of votes cast shall be required for election. Where
   the election for an office other than President or Secretary-Treasurer
   results in a tie or where no nominee for Local Union President or
   Secretary-Treasurer receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff
   election between the two nominees with the higher number of votes
   shall be conducted.
   
   12. When nominations have been completed and there are unopposed
   candidates, such unopposed candidates shall be deemed elected by
   acclamation.
   
   13. a) A Local Union may provide in its bylaws for nominations to be
   conducted by petition. Such Local Union bylaw provisions shall
   establish procedures for nomination by petition, and such procedures
   shall be consistent with the provisions of this Article. Such bylaw
   provisions shall establish a number of signatures of active members of
   the Local Union required for nomination of an active member for a
   specific office. The number of signatures required shall not exceed 2
   percent of the average monthly active membership of the Local Union,
   based on the number of active members on which the Local Union pays
   per capita tax to the International Union, for the twelve-month period
   ending with the next to last month prior to the month in which the
   notice of nominations is mailed to the membership. If the Local
   Union's bylaws provide that any of its Vice Presidents shall be
   nominated by a designated portion of the Local Union's membership,
   such as by the members in a designated geographical area or trade
   division, the average monthly active membership shall be deemed to
   refer to the average monthly active membership in that portion of the
   Local Union's membership, the number of signatures required for such
   Vice President shall be adjusted accordingly, and all signatures
   required for nomination of such Vice President shall be from the
   active membership in such designated portion of the Local Union's
   membership.
   
   b) Not less than 30 days prior to the deadline for the receipt of
   nomination petitions, notice shall be mailed by the Local Union to
   each member at the member's last known home address, setting forth the
   manner for conducting the nominations, the actual number of signatures
   required for nomination petitions, the deadline date for the receipt
   of petitions, and all other relevant requirements for the filing of
   petitions, including what each petition is required to contain. Notice
   of nominations and election may be combined into a single notice,
   which shall be mailed in accordance with the time requirements of this
   paragraph.
   
   c) Each petition shall indicate the member who is being nominated and
   the specific office for which he or she is being nominated. If a
   member is being nominated for a Vice President position, the petition
   shall specify the numerically designated Vice President position for
   which he or she is being nominated. Unless otherwise specified in the
   Local Union's bylaws, any petition may nominate more than one member
   for office, provided that each member is being nominated for a
   different office and that the office for which each member is being
   nominated is specifically indicated. Each petition shall contain the
   signature, printed name, and other identifying information, as
   determined by the general chairperson of the election, of each member
   signing the petition. Petitions shall be filed at the Local Union
   office by mail or in person. The original signatures are required to
   be filed, and transmission by facsimile, computer, or other form of
   electronic transmission shall not be valid. If a signature on any
   petition is not accompanied by a printed name or the other identifying
   information required by the general chairperson, but the identity of
   the member can be determined from the signature, the signature shall
   be deemed valid and shall be counted.
   
   14. The ballots and all other records pertaining to the nominations
   and elections, including the membership mailing lists which were used
   to send the notices of the nominations and elections, shall be
   preserved for not less than one year by the Local Union President.
   
   15. A copy of the results of the election shall be immediately mailed
   to the International President.
   
   16. Formal installation of the newly elected officers may be either
   before or after the start of their term of office to suit the
   convenience of the Local Union, but in any event, during either the
   month preceding or the two months following the start of their term of
   office; provided, however, that no officer shall be deemed to be in
   office unless bonded where required by the Constitution and laws of
   the International Union.
   
   17. No funds of the International Union or any of its chartered bodies
   shall be used to promote the candidacy of any person for any elective
   office within any chartered body.
   
   18. No publications sponsored by or supported by the International
   Union or any chartered body shall be used to promote the candidacy of
   any person for elective office within any chartered body.
   
   19. In the event any candidate for the office of President dies
   between nominations and the completion of the election, the election
   shall be postponed. New nominations for all offices and an election
   for same shall be conducted prior to the conclusion of the present
   term of office, unless compliance with the other time provisions of
   this Article or the Local Union's bylaws is not possible. Notice of
   the rescheduled nominations and election shall be mailed to the
   membership pursuant to the provisions of Article 35(C) 1, 2, and 3.
   
   20. Not more than 15 days subsequent to the election, all challenges
   to the election shall be submitted to the general chairperson of the
   election. The Local Union general chairperson and election judges
   shall consider any such challenge and take such remedial action as
   they deem appropriate. Not more than 15 days subsequent to such
   decision, an aggrieved party may appeal such decision to the

                       Local Union Board of Trustees
                                      
   (A) Three Local Union Executive Board members, by virtue of their
   offices, shall constitute the Local Union Board of Trustees. Two of
   these shall be the President and the Secretary-Treasurer, and the
   Local Union Executive Board shall annually designate one of the other
   members of the Executive Board to be the third trustee.
   
   (B) The trustees shall be responsible for ensuring that all finances
   of the Local Union are managed in accordance with the Constitution and
   laws of the International Union and the approved bylaws of the Local
   Union. The trustees shall be responsible for ensuring that the funds
   and property of the Local Union are properly received and managed for
   the sole use and benefit of the Local Union and in accordance with
   standard accounting practices.
   
   (C) The signatures of two of the three trustees shall be required on
   all checks and all other financial documents, and the trustees shall
   be responsible for ensuring that all banks and other financial
   institutions holding funds or property of the Local Union are so
   instructed.
   
   (D) The trustees shall examine the financial records of the Local
   Union. The trustees shall make a quarterly financial report to the
   International Secretary-Treasurer on forms supplied or approved by the
   International Secretary-Treasurer and on such schedule as he or she
   may determine, and they shall also promptly submit a copy of said
   report to the Local Union Executive Board. The trustees shall also
   file with the International Secretary-Treasurer copies of all audits
   required by this Constitution and all annual financial reports
   required by the federal government within 30 days of their completion.
   
   (E) The trustees shall employ a certified public accountant or a
   chartered accountant to assist them in the performance of their duties
   and to perform a complete audit of the Local Union not less than once
   a year, except that in Local Unions whose membership at the end of the
   fiscal year is less than 2,500, the trustees may employ a certified
   public accountant or a chartered accountant to perform a review and
   issue an opinion, and except further that, Local Unions whose
   membership at the end of the fiscal year is less than 250 shall not be
   subject to the requirements of this paragraph.
   
   (F) The trustees shall ensure that Local Union officers,
   representatives, and employees are bonded as directed by the

   by the Local Union shall be vested by proper conveyance in its own
   name, if applicable state or provincial law permits; in the name of a
   corporate trustee or the Board of Trustees and their successors in
   office, to be held by the corporate trustee or the Board of Trustees
   in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Local Union; or in a
   separate building corporation whose charter and other corporate
   documents have been approved by the International President.
   
                                 ARTICLE 37
                                      
                             Local Union Funds
                                      
   (A) The general or special funds or property of a Local Union shall be
   used only for such purposes as are specified in the Constitution and
   laws of the International Union or the Local Union bylaws, as may be
   established by proper resolution of the Local Union Executive Board,
   or as may be required to transact and properly conduct the business of
   the Local Union.
   
   (B) The Local Union shall, under no circumstances, use any of its
   funds for loans or donations to officers and employees. The Local
   Union Executive Board may authorize financial assistance to members in
   the event of a strike, lockout, or other economic action, or in the
   case of a personal disaster.
   
   (C) Any disposition of the property of a Local Union for less than
   fair market value at any time or liquidation of a substantial portion
   of the assets of a Local Union in contemplation of the Local Union's
   becoming defunct, dissolved, withdrawn, or expelled shall be subject
   to the prior review and approval of the International President,
   subject to an appeal to the International Executive Board.
   
                                 ARTICLE 38
                                      
                            Local Union Revenue
                                      
   (A) 1. Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, reasonable
   dues, initiation and reinstatement fees, and general or special
   assessments shall be established, increased, or levied by Local Unions
   by a majority vote by secret ballot of the members. Not less than 15
   days' written notice of such proposed action shall be sent to the
   membership prior to voting.
   
   2. No Local Union may provide for monthly dues for any member which
   are less than two times the current per capita tax of the
   International Union, unless otherwise approved by the International
   Executive Board, provided that Local Unions may provide for monthly
   dues for affiliated members which are not less than the current per
   capita tax of the International Union. An applicant for membership
   shall pay an initiation or reinstatement fee, unless otherwise
   provided pursuant to this Constitution, plus the current month's dues
   and assessments.
   
   3. In order to ensure the financial health of the International Union
   and its Local Unions, the monthly dues in each Local Union shall be
   increased in the amount of $1.00 per month for each member effective
   January 1, 1999, and increased in an additional amount of $1.00 per
   month for each member effective January 1, 2001. If the International
   Executive Board exercises its authority pursuant to Article 18(A)3 of
   this Constitution to increase the per capita tax an additional amount
   effective June, 2002, or later, the monthly dues in each Local Union
   shall be increased by an additional amount equal to twice such
   increase in the per capita tax, effective the first day of the month
   such per capita tax increase is effective.
   
   (B) Each Local Union shall maintain an accurate record of the dues and
   other moneys collected from each member. All moneys collected by the
   Local Union for initiation fees, reinstatement fees, dues,
   assessments, etc., shall be the property of the Local Union, with the
   exception of the monthly per capita tax and fees as set forth in
   Article 18, which are the property of the International Union.
   
   (C) Each Local Union shall be responsible for the money of all members
   paid to the Local Union and not forwarded to the International
   Secretary-Treasurer in accordance with the Constitution. Every Local
   Union shall be responsible for any and all benefits due members or
   their heirs where a member is not in benefit standing in the
   International Union through the neglect or fault of a Local Union or
   any of its officers to remit per capita taxes, or to perform any other
   duties incumbent upon them, within the time limit fixed by this
   Constitution.
   
   (D) Any Local Union may include in its bylaws a provision for payment
   by the Local Union of all or a specified portion of the dues of such
   of its members who are temporarily incapacitated due to illness or
   disability, are unemployed due to an authorized strike or a lockout '
   or are officers or stewards not in the primary employment of the
   International Union or any of its chartered bodies.
   
   (E) 1. Dues shall be due and payable on or before the first day of the
   month for which they are due.
   
   2. Any member two calendar months in arrears for dues and fees to the
   Local Union shall stand suspended if they are not paid on or before
   the first day of the third month. After the expiration of such period,
   no Local Union shall accept dues without a reinstatement application
   and the required fee. The responsibility for maintaining membership
   rests with the member; suspension, therefore, when it occurs, is the
   voluntary act of the member involved.
   
   (F) A suspended member working within the jurisdiction of the
   International Union may, upon application, be reinstated in the Local
   Union within whose jurisdiction he or she is working, upon the payment
   to the Local Union of the regular reinstatement fee or dues of that
   Local Union, provided that such reinstatement shall not relieve a
   suspended member of any past financial obligations.
   
   (G) The provisions of this Constitution relating to the payment of 
   dues, assessments, fines, penalties, etc., shall not be construe as
   incorporating into any union-security contract those requirements for
   good standing membership which may be in violation of applicable law,
   nor shall they be construed as requiring any employer to violate any
   applicable law. However, all financial obligations imposed by or under
   this Constitution and Local Union bylaws (and in conformity
   there with) shall be legal obligations of the members upon whom imposed
   and shall be enforceable in a court of law. 
   

				ARTICLE 39
     
			 Constitutional Amendment
    
   (A) This Constitution can be amended only by a two-thirds vote at a
   duly constituted Convention of the International Union.
    
   (B) All amendments to this Constitution shall be effective immediately
   upon adoption, unless otherwise specified in such amendments. 


				ARTICLE 40 

				  Repeal
     
   All laws or parts of laws previously enacted by this International
   Union and interpretations of the International President, International
   Secretary-Treasurer, or International Executive Board in conflict
   herewith, are hereby repealed.
