<p class="blackbar">Welcome to the <i>Anarcho-Syndicalist 
Review</i> Website</p>

<p><img src="/images/covers/cover27.gif" align=right>ASR is a forum for
non-sectarian, critical, informed and constructive discussion of
anarcho-syndicalist theory and practice. We are not affiliated with,
sponsored by, or the mouth-piece of any organization. Our outlook is
internationalist. We stand in solidarity with working people everywhere,
and in particular with those who, rejecting both state capitalism and
state socialism as proven threats to the health of people and planet
alike, seek peace and justice for themselves and their fellow workers
through international labor solidarity.  This is our official website.</p>
