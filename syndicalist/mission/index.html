<p class="blackbar">Principles of Revolutionary Syndicalism</p>

<p><b>Adopted December 1922 by the Berlin Congress of the International
Workers' Association (Extracts)</b></p>

<p>i. Revolutionary Syndicalism, basing itself on the class struggle,
seeks to establish the unity and solidarity of all manual and intellectual
workers into economic organisations fighting for the abolition of both the
wage system and the State. Neither the State nor political parties can
achieve the economic organisation and emancipation of labour.</p>

<p>ii. Revolutionary Syndicalism maintains that economic and social
monopolies must be replaced by free, self-managing federations of
agricultural and industrial workers united in a system of councils.</p>

<p>iii. The twofold task of Revolutionary Syndicalism is to carry on the
struggle for economic, social and intellectual improvement in the existing
society, and to achieve independent self-managed production and
distribution by taking possession of the earth and the means of
production. Instead of the State and political parties, the economic
organisation of labour. Instead of government over people, the
administration of things.</p>

<p>iv. Revolutionary Syndicalism is based on the principles of federalism,
free agreement and grassroots organisation from the base upwards into
local, district, regional and international federations united by shared
aspirations and common interests. Under federalism, each unit enjoys full
autonomy and independence in its own sphere, while enjoying all the
advantages of association.</p>

<p>v. Revolutionary Syndicalism rejects nationalism, the religion of the
State and all arbitrary frontiers, recognising only the self-rule of
natural communities freely enjoying their own way of life, constantly
enriched by the benefits of free association with other federated
communities.</p>

<p>vi. Revolutionary Syndicalism, basing itself on economic direct action,
supports all struggles not in contradiction with its principles - the
abolition of economic monopoly and the domination of the State. The means
of direct action are the strike, the boycott, the sit-in, and other forms
of direct action developed by workers in the course of their struggles
leading to labour's most effective weapon, the General Strike, prelude to
Social Revolution.</p>
