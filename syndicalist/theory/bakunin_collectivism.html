<p class="blackbar">The Collectivist Tradition</p>

<p><i>Anarchist economics began with Proudhon but eventually 
developed into two schools of thought: anarcho-syndicalism with its 
emphasis on mass production industries in an urban environment, and 
anarchist-communism with its emphasis on egalitarian distribution and 
small-scale communities. Both these theories developed out of 
anarcho-collectivism, a radical economic federalism developed by the 
libertarian elements of the (First) International Workingmen's 
Association. Its principal advocates were Michael Bakunin and James 
Guillaume, but the real credit for the theory of collectivism should go to 
the workers belonging to the International, who took the various socialist 
and trade union economic ideas of the time and modified them in light of 
their own experience.</i></p>

<p><b>The Limits of Proudhonian Economics</b></p>

<p>The collectivists shared a number of ideas with the followers of 
Proudhon in the International, in particular the concepts of workers 
self-management of industry and economic federalism. On the other hand 
they saw a need to go beyond the sort of utopian thinking that led the 
Proudhonists to believe capitalism might be transformed by the growth of 
worker cooperatives and mutualist credit. By the time the International 
was formed in 1864, worker cooperatives had been experimented with for 
several decades and by now were floundering. In the last years of his 
life, even Proudhon was forced to admit the cooperative movement was not 
developing as he had hoped:</p>

<blockquote>Not many years later, in 1857, he severely criticized the 
existing workers' associations; inspired by naive, utopian illusions, they 
had paid the price of their lack of experience. They had become narrow and 
exclusive, had functioned as collective employers, and had been carried 
away by hierarchical and managerial concepts. All the abuses of capitalist 
companies "were exaggerated further in these so-called brotherhoods." They 
had been torn by discord, rivalry, defections, and betrayals. Once their  
managers had learned the business concerned, they retired to "set up as 
bourgeois employers on their own account." In other instances, the members 
had insisted on dividing up the resources. In 1848 several hundred 
workers' associations had been set up; nine years later only twenty 
remained. (Guerin, pp. 47-48)</blockquote>

<p>These same observations were made by the members of the International: 
"The English section reported on cooperatives. Without denying the 
usefulness of cooperative organizations, it indicated a dangerous tendency 
noticeable in a majority of such bodies in England, which were beginning 
to develop into purely commercial and capitalist institutions, thus 
creating the opportunity for the birth of a new class - the working 
bourgeoisie." (Maximoff, p. 47)</p>

<p>The small, isolated, under-capitalized worker cooperatives could barely 
survive in competition with their better established capitalist rivals. 
The few cooperatives that prospered, often betrayed their working class 
supporters and began to operate as though their facilities were their own 
private property, aided and abetted by the laws and existing capitalist 
businesses. The failings of the cooperatives had raised the thorny issue 
of how to turn the socialization of the means of production from an ideal 
into a practical reality. The solution suggested by the collectivists was 
to expropriate the means of production from the capitalists and for the 
workers' associations to own these "collectively", no longer recognizing 
any individual ownership rights to divide up and sell them. The third 
Congress of the International accordingly passed a resolution that the 
main purpose of the cooperatives must go beyond narrow self-interest. 
Instead their purpose must be support the struggle "to wrench from the 
hands of the capitalists the means of production and return them to their 
rightful owners, the workers themselves." (Guillaume, p. 70)</p>

<p>As we have seen, in The Principle of Federation (1863), Proudhon began 
to sketch the outlines of a sort of economic federalism before he died. 
This did not, however, prevent his mutualist followers from trying to 
defend his earlier ideas. At the 1869 Basel Congress of the International, 
a dispute arose over a resolution calling for the collectivization of the 
land. The Proudhonists held out for the right of small farmers to own land 
privately, as long as they did not rent out the land for others to work. 
Tolain, speaking for the mutualists, suggested the resolution be changed 
to read, "The Congress declares that, to realize the emancipation of the 
worker, it must transform the leases of farmland...to contracts of sale: 
so that ownership, continually in circulation, ceases to be abusive in 
itself; and consequently [by ensuring the individual worker the right to 
the product of his labors]...safeguards the liberty of the individual 
groups." (Guillaume, p. 197)</p>

<p>Bakunin, speaking for the collectivists, disputed the notion that 
private property, even in a limited form, was justified as a means for 
safeguarding individual rights.
</p>

<blockquote>...the individual is a product of society, and without society 
man is nothing. All productive labor is above all social labor; 
"production is only possible through the combination of the labor of past 
generations with the present generation, there is not ever labor that can 
be called individual labor." He [Bakunin] is thus a supporter of 
collective property, not only of the soil, but of all social wealth. As 
for the organization of agricultural production, it is concluded by the 
solidarization of the communes, as proposed by the majority of the 
commission, all the more willingly that this solidarization implies the 
organization of society from the bottom upwards, while the proposition of 
the minority presupposes a State [to guarantee and enforce the terms of 
sale]. (Guillaume, p. 197)</blockquote>

<p>To be fair to Proudhon and the mutualists, their waffling on the issue 
of private property was not so much due to ambivalence about collective 
ownership, as an example of the extremes they were prepared to go to avoid 
a revolutionary confrontation. Mutualist credit was intended to produce "a 
new economic arrangement" which would somehow avoid the "shock" of violent 
confrontation with the capitalists over their property rights. To the 
collectivists, who were veterans of bitter labor strikes and 
insurrections, this was hopelessly idealistic. Capitalism had not 
originated out of a peaceful, democratic debate as to how to organize 
production to ensure economic justice and well-being for all, but was the 
product of centuries of fraud, theft, and State-sponsored violence. 
Proudhon often ignored that these activities were as much a part of the 
functioning of the existing economy as was the official market side of 
capitalism. The State and the capitalists would not disappear with a new 
set of rules, since they, more often than not, did not play by their own 
rules.</p>

<p>Although Proudhon had discovered many of the contradictions of 
capitalist economics, his non-confrontational solutions were just too out 
of touch with reality. What the anarchists needed was to base their 
economics less on moral arguments than on a positivist materialism. As 
Bakunin put it:</p>

<blockquote>...Proudhon remained an incorrigible idealist all his life, 
swayed at one moment by the Bible and at the next by Roman Law ...His 
great misfortune was that he never studied natural science and adopted its 
methods....As a thinker Marx is on the right path. He has set up the 
principle that all religious, political and legal developments in history 
are not the cause but the effect of economic developments. Many others 
before him had a hand in the unveiling of it and even expressed it in 
part, but in the last resort credit is due to him for having developed the 
idea scientifically and having made it the basis of his whole scientific 
teaching. On the other hand, Proudhon understood the idea of freedom 
better than Marx. (Jackson, pp. 128-129)</blockquote>

<p><b>Collectivism and Marxism</b></p>

<p>The criticism Bakunin made of Proudhon's idealism was perhaps a kinder 
version of the same criticism Marx had made in The Poverty of Philosophy. 
It is on the basis of such statements, as well as his praise for Marx's 
Capital, that some argue that Bakunin shared the economic views of Marx. 
In reality Bakunin and his fellow collectivists differed with Marx on 
economic grounds as well as on political matters. Bakunin did begin a 
translation of Capital into Russian, but never completed it. Had his 
enthusiasm for the work been as overwhelming as some claim, he would no 
doubt have finished it and collected the remainder of the sum agreed upon 
by the Russian publishing house (instead of getting expelled at the Hague 
Congress of the International for allegedly threatening the publisher in 
order to get out of the deal). A closer look at what Bakunin thought about 
Capital reveals his real reason for admiring the work:</p>

<blockquote>...nothing, that I know of, contains an analysis so profound, 
so luminous, so scientific, so decisive and if I can express it thus, so 
merciless an expose of the formation of bourgeois capital and the 
systematic and cruel exploitation that capital continues exercising over 
the work of the proletariat. The only defect of this work...is that it has 
been written, in part, in a style excessively metaphysical and 
abstract...which makes it difficult to explain and nearly unapproachable 
for the majority of workers. (Bakunin, p. 195)</blockquote>

<p>Bakunin, more the revolutionary than the economist, admired Capital as 
a great piece of revolutionary propaganda. Marx, drawing his facts and 
figures out of British government documents and parliamentary debates, had 
hoisted the capitalists by their own petards. This does not mean he 
endorsed it verbatim. Bakunin had earlier translated The Communist 
Manifesto into Russian and made no bones about his disagreements with Marx 
and Engels over their proposals for a centralized state socialist 
economy.</p>

<blockquote>I am not a communist because communism concentrates and 
absorbs all the powers of society into the state, because it necessarily 
ends in the centralization of property in the hands of the state...I want 
society and collective property to be organized from the bottom upwards by 
means of free association and not from the top downwards by means of some 
form of authority...it is in this sense that I am a collectivist. (quoted 
in Cahm, p. 36)</blockquote>

<p>Rather than a State or a market determining the allocation of resources 
and the distribution of products, the workers would decide these things 
themselves by free agreements among the associations. These agreements 
would be monitored by the communes, and industrial federations to make 
sure that labor was not exploited. Bakunin, however, recognized that any 
system of free exchange of products still held the danger of monopoly and 
private accumulation of wealth, particularly by the self-employed farmer 
or artisan, who tried to pass on land or equipment to his children. Thus 
he also called for the abolition of inheritance to prevent the rise of a 
new working class bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>The International debated the subject of inheritance at its Basel 
Congress in 1869. Marx was opposed to the International taking a position 
on the subject of inheritance on the grounds that once the private 
ownership of the means of production had been abolished (and expropriated 
by the workers' government), there would be nothing left to inherit. Even 
worse, it implied the International would support something other than the 
state communism of Marx. As Eccarius, speaking for Marx, put it, "the 
abolition of the right of inheritance can not be the point of departure 
for the same social transformation: it would be too absurd to require the 
abolition of the law of supply and demand while continuing the state of 
conditions of exchange; it would be a reactionary theory in practice. By 
treating the laws of inheritance, we suppose necessarily that individual 
ownership of the means of production would continue to exist." (Guillaume, 
p. 201)</p>

<p>Eccarius was half right. Bakunin and the other collectivists intended 
that something other than the state ownership of the means of production 
and central control would exist, but it would not necessarily be 
capitalist ownership nor a market economy. The full collectivization of 
the economy would not be carried out by a single decree, but over a 
generation. Abolition of wage labor by the collectivization of the 
capitalist employers would be the first step, but the right of the 
self-employed, particularly the small farmer, to their means of livelihood 
would be respected. To recognize this right of possession to the tools 
needed for one's own labor, however, was not to recognize an ownership 
right that could be bought and sold or passed on to one's children. This 
was the meaning behind the collectivist demand for the abolition of 
inheritance.</p>

<p>If after having proclaimed the social liquidation, we attempted to 
dispossess by decree millions of small farmers, they would necessarily be 
thrown onto the side of reaction, and in order for them to submit to the 
revolution, it would be necessary to employ force against them...It would 
be well then to leave them possessors in fact of those small parcels of 
which they are proprietors. But if you don't abolish the right of 
inheritance what would happen? They would transfer their holdings to their 
children...If, to the contrary, at the same time that you would make the 
social liquidation... you abolish the right of inheritance what would 
remain with the peasants? Nothing but defacto possession, and that 
possession... no longer sheltered by the protective power of the state, 
would easily be transformed under the pressure of events and of 
revolutionary forces. (Bakunin, quoted by Guillaume, p. 203)</p>

<p><b>The Collectivist Economic Doctrine</b></p>

<p>Collectivism, unlike Proudhon's Mutualism or Marxism, was not a well 
developed theory, the product of a single mind. Its principal advocates 
were socialist revolutionaries and workers caught up in the events of the 
time: the upheavals of 1848 which occurred throughout Europe, the birth of 
the labor unions, and the Paris Commune of 1871. As far as they could 
tell, a social revolution was not an abstract goal looming far off in the 
distance, but something that had to be prepared for right away. Some sort 
of workable economic program had to be agreed upon by the labor movement, 
which had broad appeal to the various socialist and labor groupings that 
made up the International, without locking everyone into something they 
might regret later. This explains why collectivism often was so sketchy in 
details, and some of its advocates disagreed among themselves over various 
points.</p>

<p>The closest thing to a "definitive" statement of collectivism is an 
essay written by James Guillaume in 1874, "Ideas on Social Organization" 
(see Dolgoff, pp. 356-379). Guillaume begins by emphasizing that there can 
be no "blueprint" for social revolution, since it must be left up to the 
workers themselves to decide how best to organize themselves in their own 
areas. However, having said that, he begins to make various suggestions 
about the collectivist approach. First the system of wage labor will be 
abolished by the workers "taking possession" of all capital and tools of 
production, ie. the collectivization of property. The self-employed and 
the owners of family businesses are to be left alone to operate as they 
wish, but with this important exception: "his former hired hands, if he 
had any, will become his partners and share with him the products which 
their common labor extracts from the land." (Dolgoff, p. 359)</p>

<p>The internal organization of the worker collectives, working 
conditions, hours, distribution of responsibilities, and share of income, 
etc., are to be left in the hands of their members: "Each workshop, each 
factory, will organize itself into an association of workers who will be 
free to administer production and organize their work as they think best, 
provided that the rights of each worker are safeguarded and the principles 
of equality and justice are observed." (Dolgoff, p. 363, my emphasis)</p>

<p>However the fact that the collectivists were willing to tolerate those 
groups which decided to distribute income according to hours worked, does 
not mean the collectivists believed in the principle, "to each according 
to their work." As Guillaume makes clear, this is only justified (where it 
is practiced) as a temporary expedient, to discourage over-consumption 
during the transition period when capitalist conditions of scarcity will 
not yet have been overcome.</p>

<blockquote>In some communities remuneration will be in proportion to 
hours worked; in others payment will be measured by both the hours of work 
and the kind of work performed; still other systems will be experimented 
with to see how they work out. The problem of property having been 
resolved, and there being no capitalists placing a tax on the labor of the 
masses, the question of types of distribution and remuneration become 
secondary. We should to the greatest possible extent institute and be 
guided by the principle From each according to his ability, to each 
according to his need. When, thanks to the progress of scientific industry 
and agriculture, production comes to outstrip consumption, and this will 
be attained some years after the Revolution, it will no longer be 
necessary to stingily dole out each worker's share of goods... (Dolgoff, 
p. 361)</blockquote>

<p>Although collectivism promotes the greatest autonomy for the worker 
associations, it should not be confused with a market economy. The goods 
produced by the collectivized factories and workshops are exchanged not 
according to highest price that can be wrung from consumers, but according 
to their actual production costs. The determination of these honest prices 
is to be by a "Bank of Exchange" in each community (obviously an idea 
borrowed from Proudhon).</p>

<blockquote>...the [labor] value of the commodities having been 
established in advance by a contractual agreement between the regional 
cooperative federations [ie. industrial unions] and the various communes, 
who will also furnish statistics to the Banks of Exchange. The Bank of 
Exchange will remit to the producers negotiable vouchers representing the 
value of their products; these vouchers will be accepted throughout the 
territory included in the federation of communes. (Dolgoff, p. 366) The 
Bank of Exchange ...[will] arrange to procure goods which the commune is 
obliged to get from outside sources, such as certain foodstuffs, fuels, 
manufactured products, etc. These outside products will be featured side 
by side with local goods...and all goods will be uniformly priced. [Since 
similar goods all have the same average labor value.] (Dolgoff, p. 
367)</blockquote>

<p>Although this scheme bears a strong resemblance to Proudhonian 
"People's Banking," it should be noted that the Banks of Exchange, along 
with a "Communal Statistical Commission," are intended to have a planning 
function as well.</p>

<blockquote>...each Bank of Exchange makes sure in advance that these 
products are in demand [in order to risk] nothing by immediately issuing 
payment vouchers to the producers. (p. 367) ....By means of statistics 
gathered from all the communes in a region, it will be possible to  
scientifically balance production and consumption. In line with these 
statistics, it will also be possible to add more help in industries where 
production is insufficient and reduce the number of men where there is a 
surplus of production. (Dolgoff, p. 370)</blockquote>

<blockquote>As conditions permit, the exchange functions of the communal 
banks are to be gradually replaced by the distribution of goods "in 
accordance with the needs of the consumers." (p. 368) Until that point is 
reached, the local community has the responsibility for providing certain 
basic needs for everyone without regard for production done by that 
particular individual. Among these essential needs to be distributed 
freely are education, housing, health, personal security and fire 
protection, disaster relief, and food services. The worker collectives 
engaged in these essential communal services will not be required to 
exchange them for their "labor value," but "will receive from the commune 
vouchers enabling them to acquire all commodities necessary for the decent 
maintenance of their members." (Dolgoff, p. 365)</blockquote>

<p>Therefore each "commune" is to provide a basic standard of living for 
all its members during the transitional period leading towards economic 
abundance. Those people desiring a higher income will be given the right 
of access to the means of production in order to produce goods both for 
themselves and for exchange. Each worker collective, however, will not 
have to shift for itself but will receive assistance from the communes, 
and local and regional industry associations.</p>

<blockquote>...social organization is completed, on the one hand by the 
establishment of regional corporative federations comprising all the 
groups of workers in the same industry; and on the other by the 
establishment of a federation of communes....The corporative federations 
will unite all the workers in the same industry; they will no longer unite 
to protect their wages and working conditions against the onslaughts of 
their employers, but primarily to guarantee mutual use of the tools of 
production which are the property of each of these groups and which will 
by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole 
corporative federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able 
to exercise constant control over production, and regulate the rate of 
production to meet the fluctuating consumer needs of society....The 
statistics of production,  coordinated by the statistical bureaus of every 
a rational manner of the hours of labor, the cost price of products and 
their exchange value, and the quantities in which these products should be 
produced to meet the needs of consumers. (Dolgoff, pp. 
376-377)</blockquote>

<p><b>A Limited Form of Communism</b></p>

<p>In his essay, "Must We Apply Ourselves with an Examination of the Ideal 
of a Future System?", Peter Kropotkin pointed out that the 
anarcho-collectivism advocated by Bakunin, Guillaume, and the anarchists 
in the First International, was actually a variety of anarchist communism, 
but "in an altered and limited form" (Miller, p. 59). The 
anarcho-collectivists felt that full communism, ie. the free distribution 
of all goods and services, would have to wait until the economy had been 
reorganized and the scarcity artificially created by the capitalist market 
had been overcome. Until then much of production would be according to the 
principle of "to each workplace according to their product." This is not 
the same as the state collectivists who argued for "to each worker 
according to their work," and called for elaborate schemes of income 
hierarchy. The worst that can be said about the anarcho- collectivists, is 
that they were willing to tolerate income differences at various 
workplaces for the sake of giving each collective the autonomy to decide 
for themselves. This was, however, not their ideal. Even for the 
transition period, the anarcho-collectivist principle was income equality 
for all working in the same collective.</p>

<blockquote>Do not the manager's superior training and greater 
responsibilities entitle him to more pay and privileges than manual 
workers? Is not administrative work just as necessary to production as is 
manual labor - if not more so? Of course, production would be badly 
crippled, if not altogether suspended, without efficient and intelligent 
management. But from the standpoint of elementary justice and even 
efficiency, the management of production need not be exclusively 
monopolized by one or several individuals. And the managers are not at all 
entitled to more pay... (Bakunin, quoted in Dolgoff, p. 424)</blockquote>

<p>A much more serious problem for collectivism is the inequality which 
would inevitably arise between workers due to the exchange of products. 
The collectivists sought to ameliorate this to a certain extent by giving 
the investment arm of the communes, the Banks of Exchange, a more activist 
role in economic planning, and by putting an income floor under all 
workers by providing free housing, food, and public services. However, 
this creates further possible sources of inequality, since the communal 
service workers are supposed to work in return for meeting all their needs 
regardless of their productivity. Thus a possible source of conflict 
arises between a communist service sector and an exchange-based production 
sector. If the production goes well, the communal workers may resent the 
higher incomes gained by the production workers. If production goes 
poorly, the production workers may resent the income security of the 
service workers.</p>

<p>For the collectivists these problems were seen as minor, if recognized 
at all. Guillaume, for instance, assumed that the material abundance 
developed during the transitional period would bring about a blossoming of 
morality, which would soon make the exchange economy irrelevant. 
Unfortunately, this begs the question, since he did not bother to define 
what "abundance" is and how we are to know when we have achieved it. We 
can safely predict that in any future economy there is virtually no limit 
to human desires for material goods, while there will always be limits to 
what society and the ecology are able to provide without causing a 
breakdown. "Abundance" means different things to different people. The 
danger is that by leaving this point of development undefined, those who 
may be the economic"winners" of the transitional period, may be unwilling 
to make the next step.</p>

<p><b>The Collectivist Legacy</b></p>

<p>The main contribution of the collectivists to anarchist economics was 
their attempt to anticipate many of the problems which would be 
encountered during the revolutionary transition from capitalism to 
stateless communism, and their emphasis on the need for finding a balance 
between ultimate goals and day-to-day realities. These methods contributed 
enormously to the early successes of the 1936 revolution in Spain, where 
the anarchist movement retained a strong collectivist tradition. The 
specific proposals made by Guillaume and others, while useful as an 
example of applying anarchist principles to existing conditions, have lost 
most of their relevance. We do not live in 19th century europe nor 1930s 
Spain, but in a high-tech economy threatened by environmental exhaustion. 
In most industries, technology has developed well beyond the point needed 
for "abundance" in 19th century terms. This makes the question of defining 
the minimum level of abundance all the more important for modern 
anarchists, as well as the more practical problem of how to go beyond a 
crude exchange economy during the transition.</p>
