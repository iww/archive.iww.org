</p>

<p>
<b>
compiled by Jon Bekken</p></b>



<p>
A casual observer of the anarchist movement, restricted to contemporary 
writings, could be forgiven for concluding that anarchists have no 
conception of economics. Several years ago a serious debate was carried 
out in the pages of the British anarchist paper <i>Freedom</i> in which it 
was argued that all wealth comes from agriculture - that the working class 
is merely a burden that peasants and other agricultural workers are 
compelled to shoulder. The only possible conclusion from this line of 
reasoning is that we should dismantle the cities and factories and all 
return to agrarian pursuits. One suspects that farmers - deprived of 
tractors, books and other useful items and confronted with millions of 
starving city dwellers cluttering up perfectly good farmland that could 
otherwise be growing crops - might take a somewhat different point of 
view.</p>

<p>
On this side of the Atlantic, countless trees have been killed in 
furtherance of "arguments" for abolishing work, abandoning technology and 
turning to a barter economy (or, alternately, to local currencies) both as 
a strategy for escaping (I hesitate to use the word overthrowing) 
capitalism and as a principle for reorganizing economic life in a free 
society.  Such approaches may have a certain appeal for lifestylists whose 
aim is more to reduce the extent to which capital impinges on their 
personal existence (a rather futile enterprise) than to abolish its 
tyranny over society, but they are simply irrelevant to those of us truly 
committed to building a free society. </p>

<p>Although anarchists are of necessity interested in the workings of 
capitalist economies, our attention is focussed on the class struggle.  An 
anarchist economics might study the theft of our labor by the bosses, the 
squandering of social resources by the state, and the channels through 
which the bosses manipulate markets, finance and production to increase 
their profits and to pit workers in different parts of the world against 
each other.  And, most importantly, an anarchist economics would address 
itself to the problems of maintaining economic activity in a revolutionary 
situation, and to the sort of economic arrangements which might support a 
free society.</p>

<p>
We have been attempting such a study in the columns of our journal for 
several years.  In our Winter 1991 issue (#10), <i>Libertarian Labor 
Review</i> (now <i>Anarcho-Syndicalist Review</i>) announced the anarchist 
economics project which continues to this day.  As we said then:</p>

<blockquote>Far too many anarchists nowadays have underestimated the
importance of economics in their vision of social change, but this was not
always the case. The classical anarchists, who always considered
themselves part of the socialist movement, recognized the new economic
arrangements created by the social revolution would determine its success
or failure. Thus they were forced to create an economic "science," which
although sometimes in agreement with capitalist or marxist economics on
various points, must diverge from them to the same extent that it differed
in its goals. The notion of a political anarchist who was an economic
marxist or economic capitalist - a notion one runs across all too often
today - would have struck the original anarchist thinkers as an absurd
impossibility. It is our hope that this series will help to show why this
is so, as well as to help bring anarchist economics up to date with
current developments.</p>

<p>So far we expect the series to include discussions of the contributions
made by Proudhon, Bakunin and the First International Workers Association,
Kropotkin, the Spanish Anarchists and their practical experiences in the
Spanish Revolution, as well as those of less-well-known anarchists. We
also hope to add to this critiques of Marxist economics and modern
capitalist economists such as Keynes and his neo-classical critics.
Finally we will look at contributions made by modern economists such as
E.F. Schumacher and the appropriate technologists, whose views have
converged with those of the anarchist movement in several ways.<br>Due to
the scope of the projected series, we are hoping to get contributions of
articles and letters from outside our small collective. We extend an open
invitation to all in our movement who are interested in taking part in
this series along the lines we have mentioned to get in touch with
us...</blockquote>

<p>
To date we have published articles on the economic theories advanced by 
Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin; a translation of a major article by 
Abraham Guillen; a critique of Marxism; an analysis of the Mondragon 
cooperatives; and several articles on contemporary economic issues.  Our 
plans for the future include critiques of neo-Marxist and Keynesian 
economics, and a series of articles building on the anarchist economic 
tradition to suggest ways in which we might organize production, 
distribution and consumption in a free society.</p>

<p>Economics is fundamentally the study of how to organize production and 
consumption to meet human needs most efficiently and satisfactorily.  As 
such, it is inextricably bound up with questions of human values - with 
our sense of who we are, how we wish to relate to our fellow human beings 
and to our planet, and how we wish to live our lives.  Bourgeois 
economists have made the mistake of confusing their (fundamentally 
anti-human) values with economic laws, asserting against all evidence the 
necessity and efficiency of mechanisms such as markets, wages and (in an 
earlier day) chattel slavery.  Marx similarly seized on bourgeois 
economists' claims that the price of commodities is determined by the 
amount of labor socially necessary to their production for his <i>Labor 
Theory of Value,</i> a quasi-religious doctrine which cannot hold up to 
the slightest empirical scrutiny.  Wage levels, like the price of all 
commodities, are set not by their cost of production or the amount of 
labor they require (though there are of course material constraints; few 
workers will be paid more than the revenues they make possible or less 
than it takes to feed them), but by the relative economic, military and 
social power held by the respective parties.
KKropotkin's research demonstrated that shortages, economic crises and 
general distress are endemic to capitalism, but are wholly unnecessary.  
The means to meet all of society's needs were already at hand a century 
ago, but instead of doing so capitalism creates a peverse set of 
incentives encouraging chronic underproduction and deprivation.</p>

<p>
Kropotkin argued for restructuring production to decentralize agriculture 
and industry, arguing that economies of scale and specialization are 
largely illusory.  At the same time, he rejected the notion that it was 
possible to reduce labor to the individual - to isolate any one worker's 
contribution to social production.  The simple act of manufacturing a 
shirt necessitates thousands of workers, from the farmers who grow the 
cotton (or the chemists who fabricate the nylon), to the makers of the 
sewing machines (and of the raw materials from which they are 
manufactured), to the sewing machine operators, to those maintaining the 
vast economic infrastructure (energy, roads, water, etc.) necessary to 
production.  All production is social.  We enrich each other - not only 
spiritually, but materially as well - as we work, think and play together; 
and without the efforts of society as a whole no one prospers.</p>

<p>Anarchist economics should begin not from the standpoint of production, 
but rather from the standpoint of consumption - of human needs.  Needs 
should govern production; the purpose of anarchist economics is not so 
much to understand the workings of the capitalist economy but rather to 
study human needs and determine how they might be best satisfied.  Every 
kind of human activity should begin from what is local and immediate, and 
should link in a cooperative network with no center and no directing 
agency (federation).  Nor is it enough merely to meet people's material 
needs - we must also have the means to pursue our artistic, intellectual 
and aesthetic interests.  These are not luxuries, but necessities.</p>

<p>
It seems to me that any anarchist economics must begin from certain basic 
premises:</p>

<ul>
<li>No Markets: Everyone above all has the right to live, and so a free 
society must share the means of existence among all, without exception.  
All goods and services should be provided free of charge to all.  Those 
available in abundance should be available without limit, those in short 
supply should be rationed on the basis of need.</li> <br> 

<li>No Wages: The notion that people will not work without compulsion is 
provably false.  Far from shirking work when they do not receive a wage, 
when people work cooperatively for the good of all they achieve feats of 
productivity never realizable through coercion.  Efforts to arrive at 
"just wages" are necessarily artificial and arbitrary.  Labor vouchers, 
consumption credits and similar schemes are nothing more than attempts to 
maintain the reality of the wage system while changing its 
name.</li><br>

<li>What Work and Why? Despite dramatic increases in productivity over the
last century, we work as many (and often more) hours as ever, while
millions of our fellow workers languish without the means to support
themselves.  Enormous effort is squandered tracking the flow of money,
encouraging people to consume, and making products designed to wear out
quickly. Meanwhile, vitally important social needs go unmet.  Many jobs
can be eliminated, but other jobs (for example, cleaning up the
environment or building a viable public transport system to replace our
current auto-intensive one) will be created.  Some effort will have to go
to material assistance to our fellow workers in other parts of the globe
to develop economies capable of sustaining themselves and the planet (this
is a matter not only of human solidarity, but also of our own
self-interest).  Nonetheless, there is no reason why we cannot
dramatically reduce the number of hours we spend at work, while
simultaneously making that time less alienating and better meeting human
needs.</li><br>

<li>Self-Management: Under current conditions, too many workers spend long 
hours doing boring work under unhealthy conditions, while others have no 
work at all or do work that serves no socially useful purpose.  
Over-specialization, repetitive drudgery and the separation of manual and 
mental labor must be replaced with self-managed, cooperative labor.</li>  
</ul>

<p>Self-management necessarily implies federalist economic arrangements.  
Where "libertarian Marxists" such as Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel 
suggest a centralized economic planning bureaucracy (albeit under some 
form of democratic oversight) which would inevitably lead to a 
dictatorship of the "facilitator" class, an anarchist economics would 
clearly devolve most decisions to the local level and rely on free 
agreements to handle coordination.  (Of course, difficult issues of how to 
balance, for example, ecological concerns with production and consumption 
needs would remain, and some method would have to be developed for 
addressing them in a way that simultaneously upholds the rights of those 
most directly impacted by the decisions and the broader social issues at 
stake.)</p>

<p>
Expropriation, direct action, federalism and self-management are the means 
for making the social revolution and reconstrusting society.  Ultimately, 
only the free distribution of necessities, in all their variety, on the 
basis not of position or productivity, but of need, is compatible with a 
free society.</p>

<p>
As Kropotkin noted a century ago, production and exchange are so 
complicated that no government would be capable of organizing production 
unless the workers themselves took charge, "for in all production there 
arises daily thousands of difficulties that no government can hope to 
foresee ... only the efforts of thousands of intelligences working on 
problems can cooperate in the development of the new social system and 
find solutions for the thousands of local problems." (quoted in Dolgoff, 
Relevance of Anarchism to Modern Society)</p>

<p>
The society we hope to build must necessarily be built on the basis of 
what presently exists - seizing the existing industries and goods to meet 
immediate needs, and as the building blocks from which we will construct a 
free society.  To think otherwise is to build castles in the air.  As Sam 
Dolgoff notes, "Anarchy or no anarchy, the people must eat and be provided 
with the other necessiities of life. The cities must be provisioned and 
vital services cannot be disrupted. Even if poorly served, the people in 
their own interests would not allow us or anyone else to disrupt these 
services unless and until they are reorganized in a better way..."  So we 
need to think about how we would manage the transition from what is to 
what we want (it seems to me that revolutionary unions offer the best 
prospects).  While it is not possible to spell out in every detail how a 
free society might operate, it is important to think about its general 
outlines in advance, so that we might build with a vision of where we are 
trying to go.
