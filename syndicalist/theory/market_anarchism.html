<p class="blackbar">Market Anarchism? Caveat Emptor!</p>

<p>In <i>A Structured Anarchism,</i> John Griffin argues that an anarchist 
communist society, while a desirable goal in the distant future, is not 
practical in the short-term. This is because 1) people accustomed to a 
capitalist society aren't culturally prepared for it, and 2) the modern 
economy is too complicated to organize without the "self-regulation" of a 
market system. Therefore Griffin calls for a series of short term 
compromises to be made with classical liberal economics, and dubs this 
"collectivist anarchism."</p>

<p>Griffin, unfortunately, doesn't understand collectivism nor economics 
in general. He manages to garble and lump together the views of Proudhon, 
Bakunin, and Malatesta. Bakunin was the only collectivist of the three. 
Proudhon was a mutualist and Malatesta, an anarchist communist. Besides 
mistakenly lumping them all as "collectivists," Griffin makes an even 
bigger error by equating collectivism with "market anarchism." 
Collectivism, however, was not based on a market economy, but on a 
federally coordinated system of "honest exchange" of products at their 
labor cost. In a market system the prices of products are determined 
according to their relative scarcity (ie. the "law of supply and demand"). 
These are not the same thing. Time and again, whether on the issue of 
markets or money, Griffin proves he is in no position to lecture other 
anarchists about their shaky grasp of economics. For instance, on page 22 
he writes, "The extraction of large amounts of unearned income by the 
capitalists is a source of inflation, since too much money is generated to 
buy the available goods, thus encouraging price rises. Any inflation in a 
collectivist [sic] economy will not be aggravated by this spurious money 
growth, since those who operate it are remunerated only for work 
done."</p>

<p>The extraction of value by the capitalist out of the workers' gross 
product has nothing whatsoever to do with the money supply, since the 
capitalist does not print his/her own money. (In effect, Griffin is saying 
that a robber creates money when he steals your purse.) If what Griffin 
was saying were true, the history of capitalism would be one long 
inflationary spiral, without periodic economic depressions. On the 
contrary, capitalism, if not interfered with by the state, tends towards 
economic depressions (which cause deflation), since its constant drive to 
reduce workers to low wages and unemployment has a depressive effect.</p>

<p>In reality, the individual capitalist has very little control over the 
money supply, which is a source of constant consternation to the 
pro-laissez faire monetarists, like Hayek and Milton Friedman, so oddly 
respected by Griffin (p.23). The monetarists, however, do not suggest that 
the money supply be set according to what has been produced, since 
according to them only the market can determine the "true" value of these 
products anyway. What the monetarists argue is that the state should 
increase the money supply at a constant rate, so the capitalists can plan 
ahead without having to worry about whether the state economic planners 
will overreact to some minor market "adjustment." According to classical 
laissez faire theory, business cycles are inevitable and the market 
eventually corrects itself. As for the effects these cycles have on 
working people and the poor in the meantime, Hayek and Friedman could 
bloody well care less. We should not forget the role of the "Chicago Boys" 
(a group of Friedman's disciples) in running the economy of the ruthless 
Pinochet regime in Chile. Griffin should freely choose his mentors more 
carefully.</p>

<p>The state has always played a key role in the capitalist market and 
monetary systems. First its role was as a defender of private property, 
strike breaker of last resort, and as a foundation of a (somewhat) stable 
currency. More recently it has acted as a "pump primer," business 
subsidizer, and money lender of the last resort. The so-called "Keynesian 
revolution" in capitalist economics was not the beginning of the state's 
role in the economy, just an attempt to better play that role in hopes of 
making a more smooth running system and to stave off its collapse. Griffin 
himself admits that "the manipulation of the market by both the State and 
the Capitalists make the so-called 'free market' unfree." (p.24)</p>

<p> Yet by making this admission, Griffin has inadvertently undermined one 
of his own arguments. On the one hand he attacks the anarchist communist 
position because "it lacks empirical justification from modern 
technological societies: it is not enough in my view to dwell on its great 
ethical strength, and gloss over organizational problems." (p.24) But on 
the other, he doesn't hold his own doctrine up to the same standard. It 
may be true that the market system "works" (perhaps in the since that the 
inhabitants of Europe and North America haven't all starved to death so 
far), but as he admits it is not a "free market," and thus cannot be used 
to accurately predict what might happen in an anarchist version. What of 
the many problems which would result when the state no longer plays even 
its "limited" role in the laissez faire sense? Who, for instance, would 
issue money in his anarcho-market economy and guarantee its value? 
Although Griffin cites Malatesta to back-up his claim for the necessity of 
money during the transition towards an anarchist economy, he apparently 
missed the Malatesta's admonition that "one should seek a way to ensure 
that money truly represents the useful work by its possessors..." 
(<i>Malatesta: Life and Ideas,</i> edited by Richards, p. 101). Griffin, 
in spite of his enthusiasm for money, doesn't address this problem.
</p>

<p> Unlike the anarchist communists, what Griffin lacks in empirical 
evidence and practical concern for organizational problems, he can not 
make up for with "ethical strength." For in his conciliatory approach 
towards market economics, he is prepared to sacrifice even the most basic 
anarchist principles, including the abolition of wage slavery and an end 
to the private ownership of the means of production: "I think we have to 
face up to the fact that if some people want to be employed and others 
want to employ them, then wage labor will continue. Recourse to coercion 
by anarchists not involved should in my view be regarded as a 'cure' which 
is worse than the disease. As long as libertarian cultures constitute the 
dominant socializing force, I do not think that the presence of small 
scale capitalist enterprises is very important." (p.30)</p>

<p>Perhaps Griffin does not understand the implications of what he has 
written. We are not talking about economic individualism, self-employment 
or family businesses (which as long as they don't employ non-family 
members, are not capitalist). The only reason workers want to be employed 
by capitalists is because they have no other means for making a living, no 
access to the means of production other than by selling themselves. For a 
capitalist sector to exist there must be some form of private ownership of 
productive resources, and a scarcity of alternatives. The workers must be 
in a condition of economic desperation for them to be willing to give up 
an equal voice in the management of their daily affairs and accept a boss. 
Wage labor would not be tolerated in an anarchist society anymore than 
extortion or blackmail, no matter how much the perpetrator might claim the 
victims "asked for it." It would not take any "coercion" to get rid of 
wage labor either, as long as the condition for possession of any 
productive property is that all workers be given an equal voice in 
management. If not, the facility in question is given to some other group 
that will run things democratically.</p>

<p>To the extent that <i>A Structured Anarchism</i> was meant to stir 
controversy, it has succeeded. If it was meant to lay the foundation for a 
more practical anarchist economic alternative, it is a botched attempt. 
Griffin's "collectivism" might more accurately be described as 
watered-down mutualism mixed with laissez faire liberal ideology.</p>
