<p><b><u>Looking Forward: Participatory Economic for the Twenty First 
Century</u> by Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel.  Boston, South End Press, 
1991 - Review by Jeff Stein [Published in <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i> 
No. 12]</b></p>
	
<p>The economy in the Soviet Union is a mess and always has been," say 
Marxist theorists Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel.  The problem isn't with 
having a planned economy, but a matter of who is doing the planning.  In 
the Soviet Union, economic planning was exclusively a power of an elite 
class of "coordinators" [i.e. the Communist bureaucrats].  Thus it should 
have come as no surprise whose interest the Soviet economy served.  
Instead of "coordinatorism" the authors propose a rough model of a system 
of economic planning in which all workers and consumers would have a 
voice.</p>
	
<p>The model proposed by the authors is based upon a sort of democratic 
bargaining in which yearly production proposals made by workplace councils 
are compared to yearly consumption request made by consumer councils.  A 
series of "facilitation boards" tabulate all the proposals and revises the 
"prices" of goods and services in terms of additional labor required to 
meet consumer demands.  Goods and services, for which supply is not 
expected to meet demands, go up in price and vice versa.  The councils 
then revise their previous proposals based upon the new prices.  This 
continues for several rounds or "iteration" of planning proposals until at 
some point an exact match is made between projected yearly production and 
consumption.  In order to encourage a convergence towards a final plan, 
councils are limited by how much they can alter a previous proposal in the 
next round.  Proposals leading in direction of convergence can be changed 
up to 50%.  Proposals leading away from an agreement can only be changed 
by 25%.</p>
	
<p>To make sure that everyone benefits equally from their economic model, 
Albert and Hahnel propose that every worker receive an equal share of 
consumption and be required to work an equal number of hours.  In the 
former case, this can be modified somewhat by local consumer councils, 
based upon individual needs.  A local consumer council can decide to 
increase or decrease the share of individual members; as long as the 
council's total consumption stays the same.  In the case of the latter, 
the requirement to work an equal number of hours is accompanied by the 
requirement that the overall quality of working conditions also be equal 
for all workers.  Thus every worker is required to have a "balanced job 
complex", made up of an average amount of pleasant tasks and drudgery.</p>
	
<p>The idea of "balanced job complexes" comes from the traditional 
socialist rejection of the capitalist division of labor, which condemns 
most individuals to a life of dull, repetitive, often dangerous hand 
labor, in order to free up a minority for the more creative and artistic 
work.  Unlike some socialists (principally other Marxists) who merely 
propose to ameliorate the bad side effects of the division of labor by 
complex wage schemes, etc., Albert and Hahnel insist on doing away with 
the division of labor entirely.  They argue that the quality of work 
assignments determines the amount of power an individual worker has within 
the economy.  People with more interesting and enjoyable jobs have more 
control.  As the authors put it, "Classlessness and real rather than 
formal workplace democracy require that each worker has a job complex 
composed of comparably fulfilling responsibilities.the half dozen or so 
tasks that I regularly do must be roughly as empowering as the half dozen 
or so tasks that you regularly do if we are to participate as equals in 
council decision making." (p.19, my emphasis)</p>
	
<p>I am sure many will find <u>Looking Forward</u> a thought-provoking 
read.  However I am not so sure how useful a guide it is towards creating 
a self-managed social economy.  The general idea of allowing everyone to 
take part in the planning process is good, although I don't agree on their 
specific suggestions for how to implement it.  I also think their 
suggestion for making economic planning into a sort of bargaining process 
through several sessions or "iterations" could be useful.  However in many 
ways I thought their system to be far less decentralized and 
"participatory" than they claim it to be.  The authors tend to be somewhat 
vague about the role of the government in enforcing their system.  For 
instance what about a workplace council which finds the final plan so 
intolerable that they refuse to go along with it?  Can they negotiate 
their own separate agreement, or will some higher authority lock them out 
of their facilities, cut their rations, or worse?  The authors say nothing 
about the right to strike, not to mention the right of voluntary 
association, the basis of federalism.</p>
	
<p>The authors, being Marxists, still tend to be complacent about the 
potential for authoritarian abuses in their model.  Their economic 
organization requires a large number of "facilitation boards": CFCBs . 
"Collective Consumption Facilitation Boards," CFBs . "Consumption 
Facilitation Boards", EFBs . "Employment Facilitation Boards," HFBs . 
"Housing Facilitation Boards," IFBs . "Iteration Facilitation Boards," 
PFBs . "Production Facilitation Boards," and UFBs . "Updating Facilitation 
Boards."  Supposedly the facilitators have no power other than collecting 
information and communicating it back to society via computer networks.  
But there is a tremendous amount of power involved in the control of 
information and its flow, particularly when this information is presented 
as being "objective and unbiased" (even more so when it is presented as 
computer data . about which the authors suggest "computers never lie").  
Albert and Hahnel argue that such power would not be abused since the 
facilitator would (theoretically) be limited to the same consumption 
levels as everyone else and would therefore have nothing to gain by 
cooking the data.  The authors somehow can not envision any other reason 
for distorting data other than direct economic benefit, such as 
ideological bias or pursuit of political objectives.</p>
	
<p>It is not hard to imagine a "facilitatorism" developing if these boards 
do not have sufficient safeguards placed upon them.  It is somewhat 
disturbing that Albert and Hahnel seem reluctant to insist upon even the 
most elementary safeguards, such as limiting the terms of board members, 
since [as they say] this might interfere with the need for "expertise" at 
facilitation.  This is even more surprising considering that they see 
expertise in every other job as being so unnecessary that it doesn't 
interfere with their "job complex" work rotation scheme at all.  
Apparently anybody can fly a passenger airline jet but it takes a special 
breed to "facilitate" society.</p>
	
<p>Even supposing the facilitator had to be changed once and a while 
(every four years?), however, "job complexing" would not necessarily end 
the division of labor.  The point of doing away with divided labor is to 
help workers control their own work, to understand the full implications 
of their efforts by allowing them to play a role in the design of their 
products and organize their own jobs as they see fit.  Thus the artificial 
separation between hand work and brain work, labor and management, is 
abolished.  Albert and Hahnel, however, have devised more of a socialist 
job enrichment scheme in which workers would be required to move between 
several workplaces each week, doing one task here, one task there, as 
though the sum total of all these fragmented experiences would give them a 
sense of control over the entire economy.  Spending a few hours each week 
picking apples will not give a construction worker a better understanding 
of either agriculture or the construction industry.  Nor would it 
necessarily give farm workers more control of their industry.  The influx 
of thousands of part-time workers with no particular knowledge of or 
interest in the industry, could make matters worse on the job if the 
part-timers had an equal vote in workplace matters and were played off 
against the regular workforce.</p>
	
<p>The division of labor is not negated by forcing workers to frequently 
change jobs.  Instead of empowering workers, such a scheme could make them 
even more dependent on the few within industry who "facilitate" all the 
job rating and the rotation of work assignments.  Proudhon made this point 
in reference to similar suggestions by utopian socialists, "As if to 
change ten, fifteen, twenty times a day from one kind of divided labor to 
another was to make labor synthetic.Even if such industrial vaulting was 
practicable . and it may be asserted in advance that it would disappear in 
the presence of making laborers responsible and therefore their functions 
personal . it would not change at all the physical, moral, and 
intellectual condition of the laborer; the dissipation would only be a 
surer guarantee of his incapacity and, consequently, his dependence." 
(<u>System of Economic Contradictions</u>, Tucker, trans., p.186)</p>
	
<p>Job complexing could certainly work at the workplace level and may be 
desirable, but making it a strict requirement for shuffling workers 
between industries is incompatible with self-management.  Albert and 
Hahnel have the relationship between power and desirable work reversed.  
People do not lack power at their workplaces because they do the lousy 
jobs; rather they do the lousy jobs because they lack power.  It is far 
more important to discuss the distribution of decision-making within 
workplaces and industry, than to try to formulate an elaborate job-sharing 
scheme which should be left up to the workers themselves.  Formal 
democracy hat hides an informal class system is a valid concern, but I 
suspect that wherever this exists it may have more to do with a minority 
having a monopoly on information and education and a "good ol' boy" 
political network, than with the absence of a system for rating every job 
for some abstract enjoyment level.</p>
	
<p>Another problem with the Albert-Hahnel model is its use of the labor 
theory of value as a means for determining individual consumption levels.  
The authors are correct in making the simple observation that if society 
as a whole wants to consume more, that at any given technological level, 
some people will have to work more.  It only seems fair that those who 
wish to do the extra consuming should have to do the extra working.  A 
problem comes in determining exactly how much each individual's labor is 
worth when production is a complex and interdependent social undertaking.  
Albert and Hahnel get around this problem with their "job complexing".  In 
theory, every hour of labor is equal to some average because every worker 
works at the same average level of intensity under the same average 
working conditions.  (This certainly makes things easier for the 
statisticians.)</p>
	
<p>Yet even if it were possible to balance all jobs in society according 
to some average level (and ignoring the huge bureaucracy this might 
require), Albert and Hahnel sacrifice the most valid application of the 
labor theory of value, its connection to technological change, while they 
retain the theory's negative side effect, its neglect of ecological 
devastation.  One might say, they have kept the bath water and thrown out 
the baby.</p>
	
<p>Let's take a look at the "baby", the labor theory of value and its 
connection to technological change.  If you wish to make goods and 
services more plentiful, you must economize and reduce the amount of labor 
required to reduce them.  According to the Albert-Hahnel model, workers at 
workplaces who adopt more efficient labor-saving technologies would be 
"rewarded" by being forced to work the hours they saved at less desirable 
jobs in other industries.  Although it is true that this is no worse than 
under capitalism where labor-saving technology "rewards" workers with 
unemployment and subsequent loss of income, the point is that under the 
Albert-Hahnel model workers would be reluctant to adopt new technology 
since they would not benefit directly.  Under a socialist system it would 
seem that the best reward for improving productivity would be to allow 
workers to decrease their work hours with no loss of income.</p>
	
<p>Albert and Hahnel would probably argue that their system would still 
reward labor saving efforts by giving a collective benefit to all workers.  
If workplace A, for instance, cuts its labor needs by say five hours a 
week per worker, then all workers throughout society would experience some 
small fraction of that reduction spread out proportionally.  So even 
though the workers at workplace A might have to work part of the time 
elsewhere, instead of the five hours, it might be only 4 hours and 45 
minutes at the other job.  Even supposing that is sufficient incentive to 
keep technological progress going, there still remains the problem of 
using labor time as a method of pricing commodities and services.</p>
	
<p>One of the criticisms used by the Marxists against any sort of market 
system for determining prices has been that the "law of supply and demand" 
creates"commodity fetishism".  Consumers only concerned with getting the 
most commodities for the lowest price, ignore the labor involved and that 
lowest price often is accompanied by maximum labor exploitation.  Although 
a pricing system based on labor time, may make this more apparent to 
consumers, the labor theory of value ignores the ecological costs of 
goods: energy, raw materials, wastes generated, natural habitats 
destroyed, etc.  These costs can't be measured in labor units.  Thus 
instead of "commodity fetishism", Albert and Hahnel would create a "labor 
fetish".</p>
	
<p>For an example of how their use of the labor theory of value ignores 
ecological costs, let's use one of their own examples.  In the chapter on 
"Participatory Allocation", Albert and Hahnel pose the problem of an 
increased demand for milk.  "Sometimes, however, changes will not balance 
so that the net increase, say, in milk demand must be communicated to milk 
producers, who then either produce more . by increasing work intensity, 
hours worked by each employee, or adding personnel . or refuse to increase 
production.' (p.80) Clearly, the assumption is that increased production 
only requires additional human labor.  But how about the cattle that 
actually produce this milk?  How about the extra land that must be set 
aside to feed the cattle, perhaps wilderness and wetlands destroyed?  How 
about the degraded water supply from the animal wastes in the run-off from 
feed lots or pastures?  These ecological consequences can't be factored 
into a labor pricing system, and therefore would not show up on the 
computer terminals of consumers voting on the yearly economic plan.</p>
	
<p><u>Looking Forward</u> has been accused by more orthodox Marxists of 
being an anarcho-syndicalist inspired proposal. Unfortunately this is not 
so.  Although the authors clearly would like to give local economic bodies 
some autonomy, there still lingers a central plan and a state authority in 
the background (one the authors claim will wither away as their system has 
less "need" for it).  Some rather ambiguous remarks made towards that end 
about Cuba suggest that the authors haven't strayed too far from the 
Marxist fold.  At best the Albert-Hahnel model could be described as 
"central-planning by referendum".</p>
	
<p>While terms like "councils" and "federations" and anarchist quotes 
litter the text, there is no clear understanding of these demonstrated by 
the authors.  <u>Looking Forward</u> is a utopian Marxist proposal with 
little anarchism in it.</p>
