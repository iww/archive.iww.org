<p class="blackbar">Direct Action: Towards an understanding of a 
concept</p>

<p><b>by Harald Beyer-Arnesen, ASR #29</p></b>


<p>Campaigning for wage-workers to join the Industrial Workers of the 
World, Eugene V. Debs stated in December 1905: "The capitalist own the 
tools they do not use, and the workers use the tools they do not own." To 
this one could add: At times direct action may mean putting the tools we 
do not own out of action, at times it may mean bringing them into play for 
our own, self-defined needs and ends. In the final instance, it can only 
mean acting as if all the tools were in fact our own. </p>

<p>
Direct action brought to its ultimate and logical end is the libertarian 
social revolution: the working class's direct overtaking, rearrangement, 
transformation and deconstruction (when not found appropriate to human 
needs) of the means of production (the material tools of freedom), and the 
disarmament of the forces protecting the order that was. If we are talking 
about a genuine social revolution, this can be nothing but the collective, 
direct action by the working class abolishing itself as a class, and thus 
the state and class society as such, making us all into citizens of a 
world of our own making.</p>

<p>
Many are those who talk about direct actions these days, fewer try to 
explore its meaning, asking what kind of tool it is. This is not a 
semantic question but one of substance - one that lies at the core of the 
whole anarchist, social-revolutionary project where "the emancipation of 
the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves," 
and the means are determined by and contained in our ends. From this 
perspective we can define direct action as being an action carried out on 
the behalf of nobody else but ourselves, where the means are immediately 
also the ends, or if not, as in a wage strike not mediated by any union 
bureaucracy, the means (decreasing the bosses' profits by our non-work, 
and thus also diminishing the bosses' power) stand in an immediate 
relationship to self-defined ends (increasing our wages and extending our 
own power). A direct action successfully carried out brings about a direct 
rearrangement of existing conditions of life through the combined efforts 
of those directly affected. </p>

<p>Nobody need wholly agree with this definition, but I find it logical as 
well as a potentially powerful instrument in developing a practice where 
the future society comes to life within the shell of the old. In all 
circumstances, we as anarchists and social revolutionaries must comprehend 
direct action within the context of our project of human emancipation. 
Direct action is however not like pregnancy, which is something you either 
are or are not. Elements of direct action may be contained in actions that 
do not fully qualify as such. Part of our task consists in trying to make 
these elements as dominant as possible, whenever possible. To this we need 
a usable definition, something to aspire towards and measure our actions 
by, and thus also acquire a greater awareness of the sources of our 
strengths and shortcomings. </p>

<p>
We will not always have the power to reach our ends through direct action. 
More than any other form of action, it tends to demand a collective, 
organizational force. Most clearly this will manifest itself in the 
working class's direct re-expropriation of the instruments of production 
and freedom. We can achieve anything together. Building that togetherness 
is the difficult part, and like a muscle not used, the force of collective 
action is weakened by passivity. On a local level, where most of our 
actions are still confined, or on international level, through the 
coordinated actions within one small sector of the working class, our 
ability to carry out direct action will be restricted by it being a means 
not yet generalized. We should still be able to make use of it some of the 
time, but not all of the time without being crushed by the forces we are 
up against. If you are fired, a sit-down strike might save your job, but 
if you are the only one sitting there it might be a good idea to look up a 
lawyer or some union bureaucrat. Something which also draws our attention 
to how the concept of direct action links up with another old word in the 
vocabulary of working class struggles, namely practical solidarity. 
Solidarity does not mean charity, and cannot be reduced to altruism. 
Rather it is something which grows out of an understanding of common 
interests. At the root of the IWW catchword, "an injury to one is an 
injury to all," lies more than a moral economy. The words also describe a 
fact of social life.</p>

<p>
Direct action has been defined as action without intermediaries. This is a 
definition in need of qualification. From an anarchist perspective direct 
action is connected not only to solidarity, but also to what tends to be a 
precondition for solidarity and the underlying principle of the concept of 
direct democracy: non-hierarchical human communication. Such communication 
lies at the roots of what direct action always is, individual and 
collective self-empowerment. As direct action contains its own end, within 
that self-defined end its meaning is also found. The more the ends are 
manifested in the means, the more it is a direct action.</p>

<p>
If we stay seated or go on playing darts as a means to prolong a lunch 
break, and thus shorten our working day, then the meaning of the action is 
also immediately the means used. But such collective action has as its 
precondition the human dialogue. It is through the mediation of the 
dialogue the ends are defined that gives the action its signification for 
us as human beings. If we stay seated or go on with our dart playing 
because the boss tells us so, then even if this will prolong our lunch 
break just as much or more, it is not direct action. Now there are forms 
of direct action that may involve only a single person, precisely because 
it is something which is of nobody else�s concern. But in general, for an 
action to be effective and have more than a symbolic significance in a 
social context, it must involve the participation of many. A one-(wo)man 
strike is at best a political statement. </p>

<p class="blackbar">

Protesting the modern-day popes and tsars</p>

<p>
If you lack water you might have to dig a well, and the act of digging 
will be direct action. You may need the assistance of others and your lack 
will very likely also be shared by them, making it into a collective task. 
But within a class society things are rarely that simple. The land may be 
owned by an absent landowner, and an apparatus of force will exist to 
impose proprietor rights. Just going out there digging the well would thus 
be illegal. Still, illegality is not what defines it as direct action. 
Collective self-education, for instance, is a form of direct action that 
often, if not always, would be perfectly legal.</p>

<p>
We could imagine that rather than digging the well without a permit, we 
organized to sit down outside the landowner residence, the King�s Palace, 
the White House or the parliament building, called in the press and 
proclaimed we would remain seated on the lawn (committing the crime of 
trespassing) until the absent landowner, a legislative body or somebody 
else with authority, granted us a permit to dig for water on his or her 
property - or until we were carried or otherwise forced away. </p>

<p>This surely would be civil disobedience, a breach of law, but would it 
also be direct action? Hardly. We had tried to put pressure on an 
authority to make or undo a judgment. In this we had abided by their power 
and authority to make such a judgment in the first place. Rather than 
letting our ends only be mediated by our own efforts and (wo)man-made 
tools - which in this case would be spades or excavators - we had put 
their rule between our means and ends. The tools yes, the instruments of 
production and destruction, as well as our own creativity: sold hours of 
life turned into instruments of our exploitation. We are the ones who 
employ these tools, but not according to own plans, needs and desires. We 
rarely utilize them as means of direct action. The wage working cook does 
not serve the poor as part of collective project in the time (s)he has 
sold to an alien force, instead (s)he casts a vote, signs a petition, 
joins a demonstration, breaks some windows or blows up a building in his 
or her unwaged time. None of which produces anything immediately 
digestible.</p>

<p>Some would define any non-parliamentary action as a direct action, such 
as any street demonstration. But to make a statement about we would like 
something to be, or not to be, is not likely to move any mountain. If the 
mere words, "Stop the bombing!" halted bombs in mid-air, or took away 
their deadly effect, the world be a better place to live. It is not any 
more likely that breaking window panes would generate this effect, either. 
</p>

<p>
That symbolic actions, and actions that borrow their efficiency from the 
very powers we are struggling against, more and more have come to be 
defined as direct actions, reflects our present organizational impotence, 
our social fragmentation and a generalized lack of trust among waged and 
unwaged workers in their own collective powers. Under particular 
circumstances symbolic actions can be powerful. But they should be seen as 
what they are at their best: means of communication. Their degree of 
efficiency outside this lies foremost in the fear among the owners of the 
world that they will be followed up by more direct forms of action. At the 
present moment, disorganized as we stand, or organized into passivity, 
they are also often all we have, but that should not lead us to the 
conclusion that they are all we could have.</p>

<p>
Often, as during the WTO meeting in Seattle, we see proclaimed as direct 
actions protests carried out in spectacular and some times violent or 
destructive ways to draw the attention of mainstream media. Though often 
denied, the whole logic of such actions is to influence the powers that be 
by way of some imagined "public opinion." And in the age of the world-wide 
web, even a demonstration of a few dozen people can appear as a world 
event if only the rumor about it is widely enough circulated, while you 
can live a couple of blocks away without even noticing that it has taken 
place. So maybe a better term than direct action in such circumstances 
might be virtual or multi-mediated action. Ironically, both larger 
protests, like those in Seattle, as well as smaller ones tend to be 
followed by a critique of the mainstream media for distorting the (f)acts, 
for only having reproduced their most spectacular aspects.</p>

<p>
Of course it could be said, and not without some truth, that the property 
destruction in Seattle had a symbolic value that it gained from the 
particular context if functioned within. I am not arguing against that, 
though this value would soon be devalued if the same procedure was tried 
repeated over and over again. However, apart from their symbolic value, 
the actions had no immediate relation to what one wanted to achieve. The 
blocking of the meeting or the destruction of property were not means to 
bring about any immediate changes in the conditions of trade, exploitation 
and oppression: they fed no one, did not reduce the pollution of our 
environment or in other ways enrich the lives of working-class people. 
</p>

<p>Exploitation and oppression always work in concrete ways, and the 
realities of what one was protesting against and the concrete points of 
possible change escaped the protesters. Lacking the power to bring about 
immediate changes, one appealed to the Pope and the Tsar, some would say 
in less than polite ways, to use their commanding powers over us to bring 
such changes about. Rather than going out digging the wells to find the 
water, one demanded of the high and mighty to order us to do so, and 
rather than blocking the ruling order from polluting our water, one called 
on them to make laws prohibiting such acts, or to refrain from introducing 
new ones allowing the pollution. One appealed to the force of their laws, 
asking for better ones: asking for an atheist Pope, a landless Tsar, a 
capitalism where money wields no power. Many will find this a 
misrepresentation: "We demanded the break-up of the WTO," they will say. 
But this, even had it been realistic - which it was not - would at best 
only substitute a not yet defined set of international laws and power 
relations for the particular ones existing or in making. It was a wholly 
abstract demand. </p>

<p>
If temporarily halting the mere coming together of the delegates of the 
World Trade Organization was all one had wanted to achieve, then the 
protesters used means (their own bodies) appropriate to this end. But was 
this really their end? Hopefully, and far more likely, they thought of it 
as a means. In the age before the telegraph and telephone, to say nothing 
about more modern means of communication, such means might also have had a 
more immediate effect, and a far closer relation to the end. But today 
such gatherings of the high and mighty foremost have symbolic 
significance. The decision-making and coordination of power takes place 
elsewhere, and not in any particular place at any particular date. I for 
one am certain that the protesters aspired to bring about an end to 
particular destructive practices associated with the policies of the World 
Trade Organization, as well as to halt even more destructive ones, and not 
to the mere obstruction of the coming together of some people at a certain 
place and time. Had practices of exploitation, oppression and destruction 
existed only in the minds and the statements of the high and mighty, we 
would not have to offer them much attention. Nor would the high then be 
very mighty. </p>

<p>If from every community affected by the policies of the WTO (or rather 
of global capitalism) there had been one person present among the 
protesters in Seattle, they would be in the wrong place to bring about 
changes through direct action. The concrete and daily manifestations of 
WTO policies takes place in the communities they would have left behind, 
and it is also there these policies could be directly confronted. On the 
other hand, such a global assembly could have served as an opportunity to 
coordinate actions throughout the world, and not primarily to worry about 
what was going on in the congress halls where the WTO delegates were 
gathered. As it was, people from every community of the planet were  not 
gathered in Seattle. What is more, those who were there, to the degree 
they at all considered the option of direct action, were in Seattle 
precisely because of their, or rather our, impotence to bring about the 
organization needed to confront the WTO through direct action on our home 
ground.</p>



<p class="blackbar">Propaganda by the deed & solidarity revisited</p>
<p>A critical dialogue in search of forms of action that could directly 
put whatever has and will be resolved within the framework of the WTO, IMF 
and World Bank wholly, or more realistically at this stage, in part out of 
operation, has hardly even been attempted, despite of, or maybe because of 
all claims of direct action practices. </p>

<p>In this context, it is interesting that West Coast longshoremen carried 
out a political strike against the WTO. However positive this was a sign 
of times to come, it did not go beyond being a symbolic action. But the 
event may also be considered as symbolic in another context. The 
longshoremen (dockers and wharfies) and transport workers in general, are 
the wage workers with the most manifest potency to directly and materially 
impose the terms of world trade. Thus also all the efforts to destroy 
their strength. But these workers would in no circumstances be able to 
wield such power for long if their "propaganda by the deed" did not also 
bring about manifestations of direct action by the waged and unwaged 
workers of the world, or at least within significant parts of it. </p>

<p>
The term "propaganda by the deed" brings forth associations to bombs and 
other individual acts of desperation and social impotence. But it need not 
refer to this. When tasks meet us on a global scale, direct action carried 
out locally to bring about smaller changes in the here and now, or 
internationally by a small section of the working class, may be considered 
as just a drop in the bucket. But if successfully carried out direct 
actions will communicate a message beyond their immediate ends, carrying 
within themselves the very seeds of a libertarian social revolution. Acts 
of immediate empowerment tend to be contagious as they practically 
illustrate roads that may be traveled outside the realm of bureaucratic 
intermediaries and parliamentary representation. Direct action is always 
"propaganda by the deed."</p>

<p>
This all brings us back to the question of solidarity and its relation to 
direct action, and then in particular as defined as an action carried out 
on behalf of nobody else. The question also arises out of ecological 
concerns. Who are the directly affected, and at what point does an act 
cease being direct action because it is not being carried out by those 
directly affected? What interests us here is of course the political 
implications of the answer given. The advocates of ideologies of 
representative democracy, social democracy and Leninism all claim to act 
on the behalf of "the people" in the interest of "the people." Anarchists 
have always rejected not only that the representatives of these ideologies 
do so, but the very notion that they could. What is more, even if they 
could, we claim that this would not be in our best interest as the value 
of being our own masters is the very essence of being a human being. 
Something, it must be added, which does not imply an escape from the 
influence and critique of others, without which we would be nothing.</p>

<p>
On the other hand we uphold the principles of mutual aid and solidarity; 
that an injury to one is an injury to all, and thus also the concern of 
all. We can skip the most absurd interpretations of non-representation, 
like: "If we see a person drowning, this is not our concern." Whether or 
not saving another person from drowning also should be defined as direct 
action is not an interesting question. Philosophical riddles are not the 
concern here, but the politics of human emancipation. </p>

<p>On this level the answer to the question leads us to another: who has 
the defining power? I define the low wages and bad working conditions in 
company X, wherever it may be situated in the world, as my concern not 
only for moral reasons, but also because, to paraphrase Bakunin: in the 
hands of the owners of the world, their exploitation and oppression 
becomes an instrument for my subordination. Brought to its logical 
conclusion this reasoning may however brings us straight back to rule by 
representation and enlightened despotism. The defining power must be 
situated among the workers of company X. However, my participation in 
direct action on their initiative, or through joint initiative and 
cooperation, would make me part of this direct action if my acts also 
otherwise qualified as such, for instance through a blockade during a 
strike. We have realized our common interests. </p>

<p>There is much more that could be said around this topic. But what is 
crucial is to grasp its importance, so that claimed direct action does not 
become a road that leads us towards elitism, and thus also away from the 
anarchist project of individual and social emancipation.</p>

<p>Once again we reach the conclusion that as a rule, the greater the task 
the more collective the action - this to fit a libertarian definition of 
direct action. We should never lose sight of the fact that the concept of 
direct action emerges out of people doing something with their own 
situation. It is for this reason that it has held such a central position 
within the traditions of anarchism and revolutionary syndicalism. Direct 
action is an expression of power over our lives: our empowerment. Direct 
actions are primarily, if not exclusively, tied to collective forms of 
actions also for the simple reason that it is together we as waged and 
unwaged workers have the potency to directly, and often immediately, 
change our conditions of life. The fewer the actors the more symbolic our 
acts as a rule will also be. They then tend to become, not means to the 
immediate transformation of part of our reality through our own efforts 
but foremost to call on the power of others. </p>

<p>
While many may live under the illusion that through direct action we 
escape the need for organizing, the opposite is true: Generally it 
requires a greater degree of organized coordination. The degree of our 
disorganization is the degree to which our lives will be organized by 
others. It is we who make the world, but we make it as a collective 
(presently under the command of and through the mediation of the owners of 
the world) and it is thus also together we can make direct profound 
changes unmediated by outside forces, and in the final instance conquer 
the world and the power over our own destinies. </p>

<p>Direct action could be seen as a kind of language: a language of 
practical articulation. As such it contains also a symbolic force far 
greater than any mere symbolic action, precisely because its message is 
contained in and not separated from its means. Much of the reason for our 
present impotence to express us through direct action lies in an ever 
increasing division of labor within modern capitalism. Not so much due to 
this division in itself but in our failure to bridge it in our minds, and 
through organization and action. </p>

<p>
We need to reconnect our means with our ends. To return to the wage strike 
� it used to signify, and still often does, striking the bosses where it 
hurt them the most, their banking accounts, by withholding our capacity 
for labor. So why did the workers of the "public owned" trams in Melbourne 
ten years ago strike by running the trams � the tools they do not own - 
free of charge for the public, while their bosses struck back by closing 
them down by force? The reason is obvious. As so often is the case with 
public services, the non-work of the publicly employed tramdrivers would 
not have cost the city council a cent. It could only save them the 
expenses of the workers' wages. Free public transport, however, would cost 
them. </p>

<p>
What is more crucial, this was a manifestation of workers turning the 
tools they do not own into means for their own ends, as well as for the 
working class community at large. What if all the waged and unwaged 
workers (including school and university students) of Melbourne had 
non-hierarchically organized to do the same, if only for day or a week? 
That really would have been a symbolically powerful manifestation of our 
potency by means of direct action. Reality is still concrete. Let's not 
forget it. Also in the struggle against the policies of the World Trade 
Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank we should 
seek to find ways to on a local and global scale halt and put into action 
the tools we do not own for our self-defined needs.
