<p class="blackbar">Nationalism or Freedom?</p>


<p><b>By Jon Bekken, <i>Anarcho-Syndicalist Review</i> #32</b></p>

<p>Writing in the most recent <i>Arsenal</i>, a well-produced "magazine of 
anarchist strategy and culture," Mike 

Staudenmaier devotes one of the leading articles to a critique of ASR's 
"extensive and influential writings 

opposing nationalism and advocating working-class internationalist 
revolution." (Unfortunately, he cannot be 

troubled to cite any of them, perhaps recognizing that his muddled 
argument could not stand up to any anarchist 

writings on the subject.)</p>

<p>According to Staudenmaier, we follow the "people, not nations" analysis 
he attributes to Rudolf Rocker, "combin

[ing] the sort of economic reductionism that is often the hallmark of 
syndicalism with careful analysis of the 

harsh experiences of the Cuban revolution." Our color-blind position that 
"working people have no country" was 

revolutionary a century ago, he continues, but today is a manifestation of 
white supremacy responsible for the 

overwhelmingly white membership of "one of the best-recruiting and most 
steadily growing segments of North American 

anarchism." </p>

<p>Citing our criticism of Chomsky's suggestion that in this era of 
globalization, the nation-state can serve as a 

mechanism for popular self-defense (and strangely arguing that the 
Brazilian nation-state, which routinely murders 

homeless children on the street, aids and abets transnational corporations 
in despoiling Brazil's abundant natural 

resources, and forces landless peasants into debt peonage, is less 
repressive than the IMF), Staudenmaier says we 

fail to acknowledge the substantial divisions within global economic 
classes posed by racial and national 

identities. These divisions, he argues, create the possibility of 
"meaningful cross-class alliances - difficult to 

assimilate into a syndicalist world view." (13)</p>
<p>In a typically confused passage he then conflates race, culture and 
nation, and claims that syndicalists say 

that the struggle for racial justice must be put off until after the 
anticapitalist revolution (which, Staudenmaier 

suggests, is exactly backward). Conceding that syndicalists are "sincerely 
anti-racist," he argues that we "

underestimate the importance of cultural identity to people's lives and to 
social struggles," thereby leading 

revolutionaries into a dead-end.</p>

<p>After some muted criticisms of anarcho-nationalist tendencies, which 
have led many who consider (or once 

considered) themselves anarchists into backing a variety of 
Marxist-Leninist groupings (a significant fraction of 

the now-dissolved Love & Rage Federation recently joined the Maoist 
Freedom Road Socialist Organization) for 

ignoring class struggle, the author turns from setting up his straw men to 
putting forward his own perspective:</p>

<blockquote>"Where ASR offers the false dichotomy between people and 
nations, the ABCF upholds a similarly 

questionable opposition between 'oppressor nationalism' ... and 
'nationalism of the oppressed' ... [But] in both 

cases, the social experience at a grassroots level is the same - cultural 
identity rooted in geography, language 

and assorted historical intangibles, producing a broad-based love and 
prioritization of a community of communities

." (15) </blockquote>

<p>Staudenmaier rejects this attempt to separate what he sees as 
inextricably intertwined positive and negative 

aspects of national identity. Instead he champions what he admits is an ad 
hoc analysis, skeptical of national 

liberation struggles while supporting them, "recit[ing] rhetoric about 
class struggle" while working with radicals 

of all class backgrounds (he apparently believes there are significant 
numbers of the employing class to be found 

in the anarchists' ranks, something I have never observed), and calling 
upon activists to embrace the 

contradictions.
</p>

<p>Anarchist support for the EZLN (the Zapatistas) is offered as an 
example "of this promising new anarchist 

response to nationalism," (16) citing Marcos' embrace of "the nation" in a 
typically incoherent quote. But for 

Staudenmaier the Zapatistas embody an anti-statist nationalism, apparently 
because they have recognized that they 

are in no position to seize state power and so instead negotiate with the 
state and pressure it to change its 

policies. Unwilling to embrace nationalism fully, Staudenmaier instead 
urges us to "participate in and/or lend 

support to anticolonial struggles in a principled and critical way. ... 
Anarchists must become involved in a 

critical way in what Marcos calls the 'reconstruction' of the nation, 
which can only happen if we avoid the twin 

pitfalls of knee-jerk anti-nationalism and uncritical acquiescence to 
national liberation. By balancing the 

competing claims of race and class, we can develop a new anarchist 
understanding of nations and nationalism." (17)

</p>

<p>
I apologize if this summary seems incoherent; while I have endeavored to 
distill a coherent argument from seven 

pages of confusion, this is at best a difficult task. I undertake this 
thankless task only because Staudenmaier is 

quite mistaken when he describes our writings on this question as 
"influential." In fact, most North American 

anarchists today embrace the muddled thinking he advocates, with 
devastating results. In upholding the traditional 

anarchist opposition to nationalism (although our recent writings on the 
subject have hardly been extensive, and 

have tended to discuss the Middle East far more than Cuba), we have waged 
a difficult and usually lonely struggle 

for fundamental anarchist principles.</p><p>Staudenmaier's argument relies 
upon an almost total exclusion of 

evidence, allowing patently false claims such as that syndicalists argue 
that the struggle for racial justice must 

be postponed until after The Revolution to stand cheek by jowl with highly 
questionable characterizations of 

various nation-states and nationalist movements. Failing to critically 
engage the one example of "progressive" 

nationalism he discusses (the Zapatistas), he leaves readers with no 
concrete sense of what this "new anarchist 

understanding" might look like in actual practice, or why we might 
consider it to be in any way anarchist.</p>

<p>
Staudenmaier is unable even to keep his core concept clear. He offers two 
definitions of nationalism: a common 

language and shared geography (11) and cultural identity rooted in 
geography, language and historical intangibles 

(15). These definitions are quite useless in understanding actually 
existing nationalism. In the Balkans, for 

example, the allegedly intractable nationalisms there (we leave aside the 
high levels of intermarriage and other 

such inconvenient facts) have nothing whatever to do with language 
(Serbian and Croatian are the same language, 

only the script in which they are written differs) or geography (the 
populations are completely intermingled, thus 

the necessity for "ethnic cleansing"). This confusion is not entirely his 
fault. The "nation" is an essentially 

mythic concept, its signifiers chosen arbitrarily by ideologues seeking to 
unite followers against the "other" or 

to conceal real conflicting interests behind a faï¿½ade of national unity. 
</p>

<p>
As Mikhail Bakunin (whose understanding of nationalism was far more 
complex than Staudenmaier's), noted: "There 

is nothing more absurd and at the same time more harmful, more deadly, for 
the people than to uphold the fictitious 

principle of nationalism as the ideal of all the people's aspirations. 
Nationality is not a universal human 

principle; it is a historic, local fact. ... We should place human, 
universal justice above all national interests

." While consistently defending the principle of self-determination, 
Bakunin (whose political activity began in 

pan-Slavism) came to see nationalism (and its corollary, patriotism) as a 
manifestation of backwardness. "The less 

developed a civilization is, and the less complex the basis of its social 
life, the stronger the manifestation of 

natural patriotism."  </p>

<p>
Bakunin also termed nationalism a "natural fact" that had to be reckoned 
with. Indeed, nationalism does exist, 

in precisely the same sense that dementia does. There are many people in 
the world who hear God giving them orders 

- sometimes cruel, sometimes bizarre, sometimes quite humane - or who see 
hallucinations. While these unfortunates 

insist upon the reality of their visions, we know better. Such things 
simply do not exist, for all that thousands 

of our fellow humans act upon them. But the mental disorder that sparks 
these delusions quite certainly exists. 

Sometimes it is relatively harmless and can perhaps be ignored, though I 
tend to believe symptoms should be 

responded to before the disease gets worse. Sometimes the derangement is 
quite serious, and must be confronted 

forcefully.</p><p>In precisely the same way, we can say that nationalism 
exists, even though there is no useful 

sense in which "nations" can be said to exist, except as an artificial 
construct imposed by states, churches and 

other powers to suit their own interests.</p>

<p>
Nations are in fact inventions of relatively recent origin. Five hundred 
years ago, the language we now know as 

"French" was a family of loosely related regional tongues that were not 
mutually intelligible. The "Italian" nation 

was invented in the 1800s, and a significant fraction of the Italian right 
now seems determined to uninvent it. In 

Chicago, in the early 1900s, there was a prolonged struggle over the 
national identity of the people now known as 

Ukrainian immigrants, with competing networks of institutions seeking to 
construct national identities as Poles, 

Ruthenians, Little Russians, Russians, and Ukrainians. With the defeat of 
the claimants in the diaspora, the 

Ruthenian nation vanished without a trace, aside from some old buildings 
where it was engraved into the stone. 

Similarly, there was heated debate within the Polish community over 
whether Jews, atheists, socialists, and members 

of the Polish National Alliance could be considered members of the Polish 
nation. Such debates had little to do 

with language or culture, rather they represented efforts by competing 
leaderships to establish dominance and to 

exclude those who subscribed to competing identities from inclusion in the 
fold of "the people."</p>

<p>
But Staudenmaier's confusion does not end with his definition of 
nationalism. Throughout his essay, he treats 

the concepts of "nation" and "race" as if they were synonyms. There are, 
of course, important similarities between 

the two concepts: Both lack any basis in the real, material world, but are 
instead ideological constructs invented 

to justify oppression and domination. Although their boundaries are 
porous, subject to constant reinterpretation 

and redefinition (as are all arbitrary categorization schemes), many 
people have internalized these constructs, 

making them part of their own self-identification. Both are poisonous, 
pernicious ideologies; there is no crime too 

heinous to be "justified" under the cloak of race or nation. And, of 
course, both are manifested in social 

arrangements that reflect not only relations of power (which have their 
own historic weight), but have also 

implanted themselves in the consciousness even of those sincerely 
committed to the cause of human emancipation.</p>

<p>But despite these similarities, there are also important distinctions 
between race and nation. While no one can 

define either with any precision, given their wholly mythic character, 
race certainly does not involve questions of 

geography or language - the only two generally agreed-upon markers of 
nationality. (That nation is not in fact 

defined in any way by these markers is a different question.) </p>

<p>There are certainly people who have historically been - and continue to 
be - oppressed in particular ways, 

justified in part by alleged differences in skin color and/or physical 
build. (Such differences have relatively 

little explanatory power; in the 1790s there was a debate in this country 
over whether Germans were "white" or "

black"; in the 1800s the same question was raised about the Irish; in the 
early 1900s Finns were widely considered 

an "Asiatic" people by specialists in racial categorization. Physical 
characteristics are purely incidental to such 

arguments, which are fundamentally about power and domination.) This 
history of oppression manifests itself in many 

ways, from the jobs workers are able to obtain, to the schools their 
children are enrolled in, to the accumulated 

resources they have at their disposal to see them through hard times or 
enable them to secure a viable economic 

foothold, to their likelihood of being shot by police. Syndicalists have 
always recognized the importance of racial 

oppression, fighting against discrimination on the job and in the broader 
society, demanding equal access to jobs, 

and putting our bodies on the line in the struggle for racial justice. 
"Race" has been used both to divide the 

working class and to subject one segment of our class to particularly 
brutal oppression and exploitation, and as 

such it can not be ignored. But its manifestation is radically different 
than that of "nation," and to treat them 

as interchangeable is a dangerous confusion.</p>

<p>It is particularly dangerous when Staudenmaier swings between race and 
nation, arguing that anarchists should 

build cross-class alliances - an anarchist version of the Popular Front 
which has sucked so many radicals into 

pallid reformism. While there is a certain logic to cross-class alliances 
for those who seek state power above all 

else (the politician needs money for propaganda, for armed henchmen, and 
his material comforts, but also needs a 

mass base to provide cannon fodder, generate wealth and implement the 
great leader's schemes), there is absolutely 

no reason why anarchists should be making common cause with our 
exploiters. It is not only wrong in principle, it 

not only feeds illusions among our fellow workers, but it is tactically 
stupid to boot.</p><p>As we noted earlier 

this year, "The right of a people to self-determination is a long-standing 
anarchist principle. Nationalism, 

however, is a fraud whereby would-be rulers 'self-determine' to impose 
their vision of nationhood on an entire 

community. Nationalism is an ideology of separation, of hatred for the 
'other.' It is a creed of violence and war 

and oppression. And it has absolutely nothing to offer the world's 
oppressed. What is necessary is to develop human 

solidarity, the instincts of mutual aid that enable us to survive and 
which have fueled all human progress..."</p>

<p>
Even many Marxists are at long last recognizing the folly of their long 
detour into nationalism. In a recent 

essay, George Kateb describes nationalism (and its close cousin, 
patriotism) as "a grave moral error" arising out 

of "a state of mental confusion." Noting that the nation is an amalgam "of 
a few actual and many imaginary 

ingredients," he notes that patriotism, in its essence, "is a readiness to 
die and to kill for an abstraction ... 

for what is largely a figment of the imagination." (907) Necessarily 
constructed to exclude the vast majority of 

humanity from its imagined community, patriotism - the celebration of the 
nation armed - needs external enemies. "

Patriotism is on a permanent moral holiday, and once it is made dynamic, 
it invariably becomes criminal." (914) But 

not only does nationalism define itself in opposition to the whole of 
humanity, Kateb argues, it also requires that 

the individual surrender her moral authority and individuality, abandoning 
her own dignity and individuality to 

embrace submersion into an ideology of hatred, a life of criminality. 
Quoting Thoreau, he concludes that only those 

who surrender their "self-respect, and sacrifice the greater to the less" 
can be patriotic. "They love the soil 

which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the spirit which may 
still animate their clay. Patriotism is a 

maggot in their heads."</p>

<p>
As Rudolf Rocker noted, "the change of human groups into nations, that is, 
State peoples, has not opened out a 

new outlook... It is today one of the most dangerous hindrances to social 
liberation." (202) Peoples with common 

history, language and cultural backgrounds evolved over long periods of 
living together in free (and sometimes not 

so free) social alliances. No anarchist would propose that such 
communities should be forced to dissolve themselves 

into some invented social identity. But this is precisely what 
nationalism, the political theology of the state, 

attempts. "Nations" are in no sense natural communities; they stand in 
stark opposition to human autonomy, to the 

right of self-organization and self-determination, and to the principles 
of mutual aid and solidarity upon which 

our very survival depends. </p>
