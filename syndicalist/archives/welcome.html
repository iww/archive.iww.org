<p class="blackbar">Welcome to the 
Anarcho-Syndicalist Review</p>

<p>Welcome to the first issue of the <i>Anarcho-Syndicalist Review</i>, 
continuing the <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i>. Founded by the late Sam 
Dolgoff (1902-1990) and three members of the present editorial collective, 
LLR began twice-yearly publication in 1986. The name change reflects our 
desire to avoid confusion with the laissez-faire capitalist Libertarian 
Party in the U.S., none of whose values we share, and to more clearly 
communicate our political tradition. The move to quarterly publication 
(February, May, August and November) reflects an increase in the amount of 
decent copy coming our way (but with additional material still needed, 
especially from overseas), along with a felt need for more timely analysis 
of current events. Other changes include a new format, a larger print run, 
and the gradual addition of corresponding editors to allow broader 
coverage. At $15 a year for four issues, including first-class postage, 
the subscription price remains a bargain, and is possible because with the 
exception of our (union) printer, no one involved in the publication is 
paid, and because we continue to receive much-needed and appreciated 
donations from our readers, acknowledged in each issue. </p>

<p>ASR remains a forum for non-sectarian, critical - and we hope, informed 
and constructive - discussion of anarcho-syndicalist theory and practice. 
We are not affiliated with, sponsored by, or the mouth-piece of, any 
organization. Our outlook is internationalist. We stand in solidarity with 
working people everywhere, and in particular with those who, rejecting 
both state capitalism and state socialism as proven threats to the health 
of people and planet alike, seek peace and justice for themselves and 
their fellow workers through international labor solidarity. At the local 
level, we support efforts by working people to improve the quality of our 
daily lives through education, mutual aid, direct action, and above all 
organizing - ultimately seeking to take control of our workplaces and 
communities in a world without bosses.</p>

<p>ASR welcomes articles, interviews, news items, and reviews - and 
readers' responses to all of them - which examine significant moments in 
our movement's history, propose and analyze libertarian solutions to wage 
slavery and other aspects of economic exploitation, and offer radical 
alternatives. </p>

<p>State capitalists and state socialists alike have done their best to 
write anarcho-syndicalist achievements out of history for most of this 
century. As a result, the immense, unstoppable power available to - and on 
numerous past occasions, successfully exercised by - working people 
organized in industrial unions is hard for many to appreciate today. It 
must be a responsibility of ASR to show how transport workers, education 
workers, agricultural workers, computer workers, construction workers, 
healthcare workers, and so on, acting together, can bring the current 
exploitative, dog-eat-dog system grinding to a halt, starting it up again 
in a form that replaces war with peace, competition with cooperation, 
scarcity with plenty, oppression with freedom, hatred with mutual 
understanding and respect. Without such mass-based syndicalist 
organizations, life in egalitarian, anarchist communities will remain but 
a dream for the many, and a realistic option only for the relatively 
privileged few - those able and willing to retreat to tiny anarchist 
enclaves amidst a sea of "free market" misery. </p>

<p>
Pushed for concrete examples of our theories at work, anarcho-syndicalists 
typically point with pride to past successes of large revolutionary 
industrial unions in Europe and North America. Unfortunately, however, the 
notorious corruption endemic in so many (although not all) craft, or 
trade, unions, including their handsomely paid leaders' frequent 
collaboration with the very governments and employers who oppress their 
members, plus the anti-union socialization experienced on a daily basis 
through state schooling and the corporate-owned mass media, have together 
conspired to make "union" a dirty word for many of the very people who 
need one most. Fundamental differences between trade/craft unions and 
industrial unions are unknown to them, as are the mechanisms by which 
unions can be made wholly accountable to the rank and file. One of our 
crucial missions is to help educate people in these areas.</p>

<p>Disagreements exist, even among anarchists, as to whether such 
"reformist" activities as taking part in the work of "business" unions, 
utilization of state-sanctioned legal remedies for unfair labor practices, 
or even participation in the state-sanctioned party political process, is 
ever justifiable, and if so, when and how? ASR will not shrink from 
discussion of such issues, and welcomes contributions on them from 
readers. The interview with Noam Chosmky in this issue (#25) explicitly 
focuses on several of them, and #26 will include commentaries from some 
members of the Editorial Collective, as well as, it is hoped, from 
readers.</p>

<p>Nor will ASR evade critical re-examination of anarcho-syndicalist 
theory and practice in general. What does anarcho-syndicalism have to 
offer for the third millenium as a vision of the kind of sustainable, 
cooperative society in which we would like to live and in which we would 
like future generations to be able to choose to live, and what does it 
offer as a means of getting from here to there? What are the fundamental 
principles, strategies and goals of anarcho-syndicalism, and of 
revolutionary industrial unionism in general? Which of those principles, 
strategies and goals are unique, and which shared by anarchists and/or by 
working people of any stripe? Which, if any, are in need of modification 
in light of changed, and rapidly changing, economic, social, and 
environmental conditions, when applied in agricultural, service, or 
manufacturing sectors, when adopted by men or women, by workers of 
differing religious beliefs or cultural practices, in urban or rural 
settings, or in first or third world societies? And to what extent are the 
practices of the current international revolutionary union movement 
congruent with those principles, strategies and goals? </p>

<p>
In the years to come, we hope you will join us as we explore these and 
other issues, both as readers and writers, and importantly, too, as 
subscribers. Copies of ASR sold through bookstores barely cover the costs 
of printing them. If those copies were placed there by our paid bulk 
distributors, we actually lose money on each copy (though, of course, less 
than if they go unsold altogether). So if you like what you read in ASR, 
please consider taking out a regular subscription, and perhaps buying one 
for a friend, and if you have access, recommending it to your friendly 
neighborhood librarian. </p>
