<p class="blackbar">The Business Unions Can Not Be Reformed</p>

<p>Shortly before we went to press Teamsters president Ron Carey stepped 
down amidst a growing scandal about his administration's embezzlement of 
union funds to finance his re-election campaign. Carey was elected atop a 
reform slate heavily backed by Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which 
waged a long struggle to rid the Teamsters of mob control and undemocratic 
rule by a handful of bureaucrats who lived lavishly off the Teamsters 
treasuries. The Carey-TDU slate took charge of the union with the backing 
and under the aegis of U.S. government-appointed trustees; today the 
government has withdrawn its sponsorship and a government-appointed former 
FBI agent once again has full control over union finances. (We discussed 
at some length Carey's at-best mixed record as a labor reformer in LLR 
#20, and critiqued TDU's strategy and limitations in #15.)</p>

<p>No worker should feel the slightest sympathy for Ron Carey and his 
cronies. Carey is a life-long union bureaucrat who has not hesitated to 
use his bureaucratic power to stifle dissidents and to centralize power 
into his own hands. Where mobster-run locals backed Carey's 
administration, he proved more than willing to turn a blind eye to their 
assaults upon not only the rights but also the bodies of their members. 
And when he found himself falling behind in his re-election campaign 
against the Jr. Hoffa forces (Hoffa was lavishly funded by the corrupt 
local piecards hiding behind his name, and much of his money was almost 
certainly stolen from union coffers as well), he did not hesitate to raid 
the Teamsters treasury of what authorities report was at least $735,000 - 
laundered through a variety of labor and "progressive" organizations en 
route to Carey's re-election campaign (though much of the money appears to 
have been skimmed off in the process).</p>

<p>The scandal continues to spread. Citizens Action has had to close its 
national office, and the head of the "progressive" telemarketer Share has 
stepped aside and may yet be moving to a federal jail cell. AFL-CIO 
President John Sweeney is so far rejecting pressure to dismiss AFL 
Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka (the darling of the labor reform set); 
$150,000 of Teamsters members' dues reportedly passed through Trumka's 
hands as part of the scheme.</p>

<p>Carey has been barred from running for re-election, and forced to step 
down from his post. He may yet be expelled from Teamsters membership by a 
government-controlled review board and/or prosecuted for embezzlement of 
union funds. The Teamsters "reform" forces are in disarray, desperately 
searching for some other union bureaucrat who might stand a chance against 
Jr. Hoffa in next year's election (though reformers are asking the 
government to ban Hoffa from standing for office as well). Indeed, the 
"reformers" don't seem to recognize what has hit them. Shortly after the 
scandal broke, but before Carey was disqualified, TDU cochair Mike 
Ruscigno told Labor Notes, "This is our chance to drive a stake through 
the heart of the old guard." And the bankruptcy of the "labor reformer's" 
strategy of trying to revitalize and reform the unions by capturing the 
top offices, relying on the government to lend a hand, is ever more 
clear.</p>

<p>Ironically, much of the labor "left" is supporting Carey. The 
once-Trotskyist Workers World Party had practically elevated Carey to the 
status of a class war prisoner, claiming that his removal is in 
retaliation for the Teamster's "victory" in the United Parcel Service 
strike. (For a critique of the UPS settlement see the October 1997 
Industrial Worker, their December issue had a detailed account of the 
Carey scandal and its causes.) The Association for Union Democracy, which 
long supported rank-and-file Teamsters in their battle against precisely 
this sort of abuse of power and looting of union funds, labelled Carey's 
election "probably the most democratic in the recorded history of the 
labor movement." (The IWW holds more democratic elections every year.) 
Even those who criticize the Carey campaign's theft of union funds 
typically portray it as an aberration - a tragic and ironic episode in 
Carey's quest to reform the Teamsters union ignoring the fact that this 
looting was possible only because rank-and-file Teamsters have little more 
control over "their" union than they did when it was a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Mafia.</p>

<p>Building a fighting labor movement can not be accomplished by capturing 
positions in the union bureaucracy. While it is much easier to gain union 
office than to build genuine working-class organizations, boring from 
within the business unions makes sense only if one assumes that there is 
nothing fundamentally wrong with them - that with a change of officers or 
a little tinkering with their bylaws, they could be transformed into 
effective working-class organizations.</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. Business unions are organized 
not to prosecute the class war, but rather to smooth over disputes. They 
are dues-collecting machines whose continuity and stability rely upon a 
passive membership. Anarcho-syndicalists recognize that no lasting gains 
can be wages within this framework - instead, what is needed is a 
fundamentally different unionism based upon the workers ourselves, 
organized at the point of production. Electing better bureaucrats 
accomplishes very little. We need to build rank-and-file organizations on 
the shop floor, relying on direct action and self-organization to improve 
our conditions, and to lay the groundwork for a fundamental transformation 
of our unions and our society.</p>
