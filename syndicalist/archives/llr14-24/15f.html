<p class="blackbar">Principles of Libertarian Economy: Part 2</p>

<p><b>by Abraham Guillen (translated by Jeff Stein)</b></p>
    
<p><i>As part of our continuing efforts to present anarchist economic theory, we offer this 
translation from Abraham Guillen's book, Economia Libertaria. Because of its length, we are 
publishing it in three parts. The first part was in LLR #14, the conclusion will be in LLR 
#16.</i></p>
    
<p><b>The Demystification of Politics</b></p>
    
<p>The experience of more than half a century of "velvet socialist" [ie. social democrat], Christian 
democrat and liberal governments practicing Keynesian economics in the West, as well as the 
totalitarian communist governments of the East with centralized planning, has been that the workers 
remain wage slaves either way, building up surplus value for the private or State owner. They are 
exploited as much on one side of the world as another, whether under the governments of Olaf Palme, 
of Kohl or Honecker, of Thatcher or Reagan, of Gorbachev or Yeltsin.</p>
    
<p>From this it can be deduced that "state socialism" is neither socialism nor communism, but is 
instead the collective ownership, usufruct, of the totalitarian bureaucracy over the surplus value 
extracted by the State. This bureaucratic socialism is the formal critic of private capitalism, but 
allows it to be transformed in the West into multinational capitalism, and in the East allows 
capitalism to be restored. Consequently, this leaves "libertarian socialism," essentially anarchism, 
as the rational and necessary critic of both private capitalism and of state socialism as bourgeois 
socialism.</p>
    
<p>But if libertarian socialism wants to be an alternative to the bourgeois socialism of the West 
and the social-economic chaos of the East, it must be able to make the beauty and seduction of 
anarchist utopia compatible with a realistic economic, social and scientific vision of the world, 
consistent with our time. It must present a social-economic program which overcomes the crises in 
economy, society, politics, ecology, demographics, energy, of moral and intellectual value. It must 
seek to harmonize natural resources and human resources in a new social-economic order in which all 
people have the right to labor and education, in a way that overcomes definitively the old division 
of manual and intellectual work.</p>
    
<p>"Is it necessary," asked Bakunin, "to repeat the irrefutable arguments of socialism, which no 
bourgeois economist has yet succeeded in disproving? What is property, what is capital in their 
present form? For the capitalist and the property owner they mean the power and the right, 
guaranteed by the State, to live without working. And since neither property nor capital produces 
anything when not fertilized by labor, that means the power and the right to live by exploiting the 
work of someone else, the right to exploit the work of those who possess neither property nor 
capital and who are thus forced to sell their productive power to the lucky owners of one or the 
other." (Obras. Volume III, p.191)</p>
    
<p>But let us again insist that the workers, within a self- managed economy where the means of 
production and exchange are socialized, without either bourgeois owners, or technocrats and 
bureaucrats of centralized state economic planning, would be capable of conducting the economy 
themselves.</p>
    
<p>Now then, a libertarian economy of the self-managed type has to be capable of producing an 
economic surplus greater than under private or state capitalism; of converting a large part of this 
surplus to the reproduction of social capital, improving the productivity of labor. Therefore the 
workers will achieve a higher rate of growth in productive forces than private or state capitalism. 
There will be, thus, better and greater production with less expense of human effort and greater and 
better use of automated machinery. This is because only the automation of labor makes it possible to 
create the technical basis for libertarian communism. Socialism or communism can be justified 
neither economically, politically nor socially as popular misery. A dominant class backlash would be 
justified as necessary if the workers eat all their capital without replacing it, or without 
increasing it more than the soviet bureaucracy or the western bourgeoisie.</p>
    
<p>Proudhon, quoted by Guerin, concerning the self-managed economic regime, said: "The 
classes...must merge into one and the same association of producers." [Would self-management 
succeed?] "On the reply to this ...depends the whole future of the workers. If it is affirmative an 
entire new world will open up for humanity; if it is negative the proletarian can take it as 
certain....There is no hope for him in this poor world." (Daniel Guerin, Anarchism, p.48)</p>
    
<p>In sum, there is no need to lament, there is a need to educate, to become the protagonist of the 
future; to prepare oneself to improve things and to make revolutionary changes; to understand the 
sciences, sociology, economy, and revolutionary strategy; since without a successful revolution, 
there can be no liberation of the workers, an outcome which cannot delegated to others but must come 
from the exertion of their own self-powers.</p>
    
<p><b>Planning and Self-Management</b></p>
    
<p>The planned economy has been praised by the technocrats and bureaucrats of socialism, East and 
West, as the rationalization and codification of national economies, with the goal of giving them a 
harmonious law of development, both economic and technological. According to this scheme, all the 
sectors of production and services will be coordinated so that none of them advances ahead or falls 
behind so much that it causes a crisis of disproportional development between the branches of 
industry, agriculture and services. However this supposed "law of harmonious development of national 
economies" directed by an army of bureaucrats and technocrats has in reality only introduced 
alongside private capitalism the capitalism of the State, leaving the workers, as always, as 
dependent wage workers. In both cases the workers are wage slaves that produce surplus value for the 
capitalist enterprenuers or the State-enterprenuer.</p>
    
<p>Apologizing for the planned economy, as the scientific economy par excellence which can predict 
the future with rigorous calculations, able to conduct national economies according to prior 
objectives based upon macroeconomic calculations, to guide the desired economic development with the 
help of "control equations" for the month, year, four-year, five-year, all the economic science 
which was the hallmark of central-planning, was declared as vulgar economic science. Particularly 
has this been the case in the Soviet Union, although now Yeltsin under the IMF has discovered 
capitalism, pure and simple, as a new "democratic" economy, even though it impoverishes the 
workers.</p>
    
<p>But after many years of centralized planning the national economies have revealed a crisis of 
underproduction, or undersupply of the market and a crisis of disproportional and unequal 
development between industry and agriculture, in the USSR and all the countries of the ruble zone. 
Indicative planning, as advocated in the West by the techno-bureaucratic thought of Keynes, 
Schumpeter, Galbraith and Burnham, was an economic doctrine, of center and left and including some 
of the right, taken up by the parties of the social-democrats, socialists, christian-democrats and 
neo-liberals. These parties mobilize the politicians of the middle class professionals, who aspire 
to a State-benefactor where, as the first enterprise of all, the technocrats are the directors more 
than the capitalists properly speaking.</p>
    
<p>By means of the welfare-State the reformist middle class, from right to left, comes robbing the 
usufruct of the government. Thanks to the sector of nationalized enterprises, of social security 
insurance, of public services, and the nationalization of many banks, a "bureaucratic-technocratic 
bourgeoisie" is created, more solid, if possible, than the old bourgeoisie. Thereafter, if their 
businesses register a deficit, there is no one who will cancel it, or even less keep account of 
credits and debtsor if things go bad force the enterprise into bankruptcy. On the contrary, the 
abundant existence of nationalized enterprises in the West has created a whole series of directors, 
executives and "businessmen" with inflated salaries, regardless of whether their enterprises can 
show benefits greater than losses. This "bourgeoisie of the State" is shoving aside the classic 
bourgeoisie, since the former has political parties monopolizing the State, the nationalized banks, 
the machinery to print inflated money and to tax with discretion. The only beneficiary from the 
growing productivity of labor, growing like a foam on the waves, is not a private owning class, but 
those who indirectly own public property in the form of State property, as a political class.</p>
    
<p>Accordingly, indicative planning or centralized planning, which aspires to impose a balanced 
national economic development, has distorted the law of harmonious social division of labor. The 
welfare State expands the unproductive sector (middle class functionaries, bureaucrats and 
technocrats), while increasing the productivity of labor in industry and agriculture. This creates 
an aberrant economy of inflation of the unproductive population which sterilely devours the wealth 
of societies and nations. It can lead to a total economic crisis, of systematic nature, since in 
order to resolve it requires more than simply changing leaders. Instead a corrupt, contradictory and 
antagonistic socio-economic regime of multi-national capitalist monopolies opposed to the general 
interest must be replaced with universal libertarian socialism.</p>
    
<p>The economists and politicians of the middle class parties, including in their ranks the 
reformist union bureaucrats, the professional politicians, the phoney savants (political, economic, 
and technical), would submit to a social economy, as much in the East as in the West, of a 
dictatorship of the techno-bureaucracy as "new dominant class." The bourgeoisie, due to the 
centralization of capital in both large and small enterprises, diminishes in statistical number, 
according to the law of mercantile competition, liquidating in the market those capitalists who are 
smaller and thus equipped with less productive machines which produce at a higher cost. But, in 
contrast, the bureaucracy, the technocracy, the professional of all types, are augmented more by the 
very same thing that diminishes the bourgeoisie annihilated by economic competition, the 
centralization of capital in the multinationals.</p>
    
<p><b>The Totalitarian State</b></p>
    
<p>In this sense, the State tends to convert itself into the largest of all business enterprises in 
the West, and as the only business in the East, that is to say, the enterprise which owns all the 
nationalized enterprises. And thus, under these conditions, the State which owns everything also is 
the master of all persons who by virtue of their political alienation see the State as God- 
protector, although the State as sole protector of Society takes from them by taxes, charges or low 
salaries more than it gives in return. Meanwhile the poor people are hoping that the State is a 
benefactor, and that a middle class political party will offer to save them in return for their 
votes. Each day things go from bad to worse, because the countless bureaucrats consume from above 
the capital which is needed below to maintain full employment in industry and agriculture.</p>
    
<p>Without debureaucratization and debourgeoisfication there is no way out of the growing economic 
and social crisis which is caused by the excessive economic waste involved in the sterile 
consumption of the parasitic classes: the bureaucratic apparatus of the State, the superfluous 
institutions filled with supernumerous personnel, the administrations of enterprises which have 
begun to have more "white collars" than productive workers, and finally, a whole series of 
"tertiary" and "quaternary" services that spend without contributing much to the social wealth. And 
we are not saying that this happens only in the capitalist countries, but that this affects equally 
badly the so-called "socialist" countries. By means of centralized bureaucratic planning of their 
economies, all social capital, labor, national income and economic power is placed in the hands of a 
techno-bureaucracy of planning, for whom workers and their products are only ciphers in five-year 
plans.</p>
    
<p>In this way they create social relations between those who have Power and those who suffer as 
wage workers not essentially different than those existing in the capitalist countries. So it is 
that the worker continues as the producer of surplus value, whether for the State or private 
businesses. Meanwhile the workers do not have the right to self-manage their own workplaces, to 
democratically decide its organization and the economic surplus produced, nor to elect their own 
workplace councils by direct and secret vote. Without these rights, centralized planning creates a 
bureaucracy based upon state property instead of social property, and endeavors to substitute State 
capitalism for private capitalism. Thus eventually it ends up by alienating into an external power 
outside of the wage workers, whether under the western capitalist or the soviet model.</p>
    
<p>The large western capitalist enterprise, national or multi- national, when it concentrates 
multi-millions in capital and exploits monopolies in production and thousands of workers (for 
example Fiat, Siemens, I.C.I., General Motors, Unilever, Nestle, Hitachi, or nationalized industrial 
complexes like IRI, British Steel and INI) leads to a bureaucratic and totalitarian condition within 
the enterprise. The workers neither know nor elect the administrative councils of these gigantic 
corporations, anymore than the workers in the former USSR. The directors are forced upon them from 
above, just as in other ages the mandarins and satraps were designated in the regimes of Asian 
despotism.</p>
    
<p>For the Soviet regime to have qualified as socialist, not just semantically but in reality, it 
would have had as its economic basis the social ownership of the means of production and exchange, 
the direct democracy of the people instead of the bureaucratic dictatorship of the single Party, the 
decentralization of power (economic, political and administrative) by the means of a federalism 
which would have assured the popular participation at all levels of decision-making, political, 
economic, social, cultural, informational and self-defense. In this way a self- managed, 
libertarian, self-organized society, would have replaced the dictatorship of the bureaucracy, in 
which society was regimented and watched-over by the State-employer, all-powerful permanent leaders 
and the political police of the KGB.</p>
    
<p>It could be argued that a vision of such nature is utopian or too good to be true, but historical 
experience shows that centralism cannot create more productive forces than can decentralization and 
federalism. Centralism is always bureaucratism and consequently consumes unproductively in the 
salaries of supernumerous personnel. In our epoch computer networks--if they are well programmed, if 
their memory is updated and constantly renewed, if they register all the fundamental data of a 
country, a society, an enterprise, a locality, district and region--are more efficient and cheaper 
for the management of the enterprise or society than the professional politicians or technocrats and 
bureaucrats of all types.</p>
    
<p>If the State is given too much power, as under the Soviet model or under the western 
welfare-State, it will tend towards state control over capital, labor, technology, science, 
information, industry, of social security and public services. Therefore this absolute power will 
create a totalitarian State, even though disguised as a parliamentary regime, symbolically under the 
Soviet model and rhetorically but not in practice in the West. In either case, the totalitarian 
bureaucracy or the pseudo- democratic political class collectively controls the business of the 
State as its business, but parasitically as a cancer on Society.</p>
    
<p><b>Popular Self-Government</b></p>
    
<p>In our school of thought, economic growth, the right of work for all, economic, cultural and 
technological progress, are developed with fewer obstacles in a libertarian society than in a 
society under the totalitarian dictatorship of large capitalist monopolies or the capitalism of the 
State. In both cases, given the great progress realized by our society, the dictatorships of private 
capital or State capital can be overcome. A self-managed society can be established with social 
ownership of the means of production and exchange, uniting capital, labor and technology without 
antagonism over classes or forms of property. This would create an egalitarian society in culture, 
economics and technology, thanks to an economy of abundance.</p>
    
<p>It is possible to the give power of self-government to the local communities, districts, 
provinces and regions, by means of an economic federalism and self-administration which would be 
integrated into a Supreme Economic Council. This would not be a Gosplan as in the former USSR, but a 
co-government of things by means of federations of production and services. These federations would 
function democratically and be self-managed, with the goal of the total process having a law of 
harmony of development without economic crises of disproportionality between all the branches of 
production and services. In other words, they would function without relative crises of 
underproduction or overproduction as occurs, respectively, under State capitalism or private 
capitalism.</p>
    
<p>For this to happen, it is necessary to have democracy and economic growth, with an increased 
productivity of labor. This would also require the full employment of the active population, along 
with the full participation of all in the decisions and the knowledge for this within reach of 
everyone. It is necessary to create a libertarian society, in which the elites of power and 
knowledge and social estates of every type, would be transcended in work, science, capital and 
technology, by means of effective self- management, the real participation of the people. Thus it 
would be possible to abolish all class domination, whether that of the bourgeois State and its 
capitalist economy or that of the bureaucratic, totalitarian State and its centrally planned 
economy. It is necessary, therefore, to liberate oneself ideologically from parliamentary socialism, 
from totalitarian communism, from bourgeois democracy which is economic dictatorship, from 
corporatism of every type--and establishing in their place a democracy of association, self-managed 
and libertarian, where everyone would be equal in rights and responsibilities, with privileges for 
no one. Only this type of self-government is government of the people, by the people and for the 
people.</p>
    
<p><b>Federations of Production and Services</b></p>
    
<p>The planning of economic, cultural and technological development must arise from the putting of 
social wealth in common and not under the domination of the State and its techno- bureaucracy. The 
first case involves a program of harmonizing the proportion of growth of the branches of production 
and services with full participation from bottom to top, based on a libertarian and federative 
socialism. The second, the concentration of all power in the hands of the State, leads to 
centralized planning from top to bottom, without popular participation, so that the workers are more 
objects than subjects, so many ciphers in the Gosplan, according to the soviet model.</p>
    
<p>If the worker remains separated from worker by means of private property or State property, there 
must be between capital and labor a power of domination over those who labor for a wage. The working 
people can never be emancipated within this mode. Emancipation can not be won individually but only 
collectively, although each may have free will. The realization of full liberty and personality for 
the worker requires a self-organized society without the need for State oppression, whether it is 
called right or left, bourgeois or bureaucratic, conservative or revolutionary. Without self-managed 
socialism, social property and self- government, all systems are the same.</p>
    
<p>The salvation of humanity is collective and not individual, because the human is a social being, 
solidaric, with the aim of self-defense from other species since the paleolithic period. It is the 
class division of humanity, in the wake of private property and the State, which makes possible the 
exploitation of man by man, of the proletarian by the proprietor. Along these lines, Bakunin said to 
his friend Reichel: "All our philosophy starts from a false premise. This is that it begins by 
always considering man as an individual and not, as it must, as a being who belongs to a 
collective." (Oeuvres, Volume II, p.60)</p>
    
<p>On this sentiment, Proudhon agreed with Bakunin to the extent that man is a social being, needing 
community and solidarity: "All that reason knows and affirms--leads us to say--that the human being, 
just the same as an idea, is part of a group... All that exists is in groups; all that form the 
group are one, and consequently, what is ...Outside the group are no more than abstractions, 
phantasms. By this concept, the human being in general...is from that which I am able to prove 
positive reality." (Philosophie du progress, Obras, Volume XX, pp. 36-38)</p>
    
<p>The human being, in reality, does not exist outside the society from which he/she has appeared as 
a free subject; but at the same time solidarity with others in daily life, at work, in education, in 
self-defense, particularly at the beginning of humanity, "mutual aid" was the basis of existence of 
man associated to man, even though under capitalism man is possessed by an appetite for wealth and 
the cult of the money-god.</p>
    
<p>Developing the doctrine of "mutual aid," Kropotkin, who studied the behavior of many animal 
species, predicted that this would evolve in a future society:</p>
    
<blockquote>"Society would be composed of a multitude of associations united among themselves for 
everything which would require their common effort: federations of producers in all branches of 
production, agricultural, industrial, intellectual, artistic; communities for consumption, entrusted 
to provide to all everything related to housing, lighting, heating, nutrition, sanitation, etc.; 
federations of communities between themselves; federations of communities of production groups; 
groupings even wider still, which would encompass a whole country or including various countries; 
groupings of people dedicated to work in common for the satisfaction of their economic, 
intellectual, artistic needs, which are not limited by territorial boundaries. All these associated 
groups would combine freely their efforts by means of a reciprocal alliance (...); and a complete 
liberty would preside over the unfolding of new forms of production, of research and of self- 
organization; individual initiative, not withstanding, would be encouraged and all tendencies 
towards uniformity and centralization, combatted." (Alrededor de una vida, p.140)</blockquote>
    
<p>By means of this federalism based upon libertarian socialism, the economy, the natural and human 
resources, the balance of natural ecosystems, the full employment of available labor, the leisure 
and education time at all levels of knowledge, the social- economic and cultural life of locality, 
district, province, region, nation or the world, can be programmed with the participation of 
everyone in everything, without creating a great deal of confusion. On the contrary, the local and 
the universal, the individual and the society, the particular and the general, would be understood 
perfectly by reason of complete information from computer networks which would register all the 
important data to accomplish at the end a perfect database. By virtue of this, everyone would know 
all, avoiding thus a condition in which those with knowledge have the power, as occurs in the 
totalitarian, bureaucratic, centrally planned countries, where the people are ignored.</p>
    
<p>The federations of production and services, dividing into natural associations, from the bottom 
to the top, create the democratic conditions for a planning with liberty. Unlike what happened in 
soviet Russia, the economic planning would not be entrusted to a dictatorship of technocrats who 
want to substitute themselves for the old bourgeoisie. To be employed by the total State instead of 
by an individual boss does not change the condition of dependency and alienation for the worker, 
except to make the situation worse; since this makes the law into a fraud, a law that does not limit 
the absolute powers of the State, which corrupts absolutely the few who govern absolutely, the few 
oppressors and exploiters written in the lists of the "Nomenclature." To change, therefore, private 
capitalism for State capitalism from a western pseudo-democratic bourgeoisie to a totalitarian 
bureaucracy is a poor trade for the wage workers since they do not cease to be what they are, the 
producers of surplus value for the bourgeoisie or bureaucracy, for the private boss or for the 
State.</p>
    
<p>In consequence, as the founders of the IWA put it, "the emancipation of the workers is the task 
of the workers themselves." From this point of view, working people can only emancipate themselves 
by the means of a libertarian socialism of self- management where "the chaos of production would not 
reign," but instead there would prevail a planning with liberty, with the participation of workers 
and citizens at all levels of political and economic decision-making; of information, culture, 
science and technology; of information processing, gathering, classification, and computerization of 
data, economic, demographic, political, social, scientific, technical, natural resources, etc.</p>
    
<p>A social-economic program, with continual popular participation (not indirectly through 
municipal, regional or national elections), must be by the means of federations in industry, 
agriculture, and services, integrated into a Federative Council of the Economy, in which all the 
federations producing goods and services must be represented. By way of example, this "Federative 
Council of the Economy" would have to integrate, among others, the following federations: Fruits and 
horticultural products; Cereals; Feed for livestock; Food industry, including imports; Hostelry and 
Tourism; Wine, beer, and alcoholic beverages; Oils and greases from vegetable and animals; Fishing: 
boats and canning; Textiles; Furs and leather; Timber and cork; Paper and graphic arts; Chemicals; 
Construction; Glass and ceramics; Metal machining; Steel; Non-ferrous minerals: metals and alloys; 
Energy: petroleum, coal, gas, electricity, and atomic energy; Information and the construction of 
computers, integrated micro-circuits, and semi-conductors; Electronics: numerical controlled 
machines; Biotechnology; Aero-space; Research and Development, uniting technology with work.</p>
    
<p>This list of industrial federations does not include all the social and public services, which 
would be too tedious to number but would have to be represented in the Federative Council of the 
Economy as well. By example, commerce, banking, sanitation, security and social security, which are 
enormous, would have to be reorganized, since these entail much unproductive work that would have to 
be reduced. The goal must be that concrete production is not exceeded by unproductive work, since 
this would restrain or slow real economic growth. In other words, there must be no false increase in 
the Gross Internal Product, which occurs when it is incremented solely by services and not in the 
branches of industry, in either the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, livestock, lumber, 
minerals, etc.) or the secondary sector (industry of diverse types).</p>
