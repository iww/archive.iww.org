<p class="Blackbar">Anarchism in Russia</p>

<p><b>by Mikhail Tsovma; translated by Jeff Stein.</b></p>

<p>Tsovma notes that this article reflects his personal views, though he 
is an activist in the KAS. He has attempted to be objective, but notes 
that his positions are inevitably present:</p>

<p>The majority of anarchist groups remain at the margins of social and 
political life, unable to propose any significant alternatives. The groups 
that were created by dozens last year have tended to disintegrate, the 
number of participants in anarchist groups stabilized approximately at the 
level reached in 1989, when the first country-wide anarchist federation 
(KAS) was created. Today the movement is still split in spite of all the 
talk of cooperation between different tendencies. In major cities like 
Moscow, anarchists can enjoy the luxury of creating 5 groups of four 
people, but in the provinces the number of activists is usually not more 
than ten people.</p>

<p>This year has seen feverish activity by the Federation of Revolutionary 
Anarchists (FRAN) - numerous pickets, leftist meetings and organizational 
attempts. Created in 1992 as a federation of libertarian communist groups, 
FRAN now has activists in half a dozen towns in Russia, Byelorussia and 
Ukraine. Its local groups usually cooperate with various Trotskyist and 
Communist sects (usually the most "revolutionary" ones). On Nov. 7, 1992, 
they even organized a demonstration to commemorate the anniversary of the 
Bolshevik coup d'etat (which they consider to have been an anti- 
capitalist revolution). The poster which advertised the demo was signed by 
IREAN (Moscow group of FRAN) and two Trotskyist groups (each one 
consisting of only one to two members). The flags of the Fourth 
International and CNT-AIT and wildcat symbols were put together at the 
demonstration. After their own march through the streets of Moscow they 
went to the Stalinist demonstration - odd place to try to recruit members 
for an anarchist group.</p>

<p>FRAN is also attempting to create a union which would become the 
Russian section of the International Workers Association. During last 
year's East-West syndicalist conference in Berlin, IREAN was made the 
publisher of the East European bulletin "of the friends of IWA." Two 
issues have been published (in Russian) and the tendency is quite clear - 
the Confederation of Anarcho- Syndicalists (KAS) is in fact cut off from 
this bulletin.</p>

<p>It is very characteristic that the decision to become an IWA section 
preceded the creation of the union - very few of the FRAN activists 
previously made syndicalist propaganda or tried to organize independent 
unions. Obviously, the attempt to become the Russian section of the 
International is a great motivation in itself as it gives those people 
seeking high esteem the requisite status.</p>

<p>At the same time, the oldest and still the biggest anarcho-syndicalist 
federation in Russia, KAS, declared (in May 1991) that it does not yet 
seek affiliation to any specific international tendency, but is open to 
cooperation with various anarchist and syndicalist groups. The results to 
date are not so great, but still they are much more real than the claims 
of FRAN.</p>

<p>Another field of activity which attracts activists from different 
anarchist groups is ecology. Every summer this or that source of pollution 
(nuclear power plant, chemical or other heavy industry enterprise) becomes 
the target of anarchists and radical ecologists. This year two campaigns 
will be organized - one against the storage of nuclear wastes in Siberia, 
and the other against a metallurgical plant in Cheropovets. Though there's 
still a lot to be desired in the efficiency and organization of these 
actions, they at least have the potential to unite the libertarian 
viewpoint and popular protest movements.</p>

<p>Recently some groups revived their publications. Thus at the end of 
1992, Moscow anarcho-syndicalists relaunched Obschina magazine, and 
anarchists in Irkutsk and Kemerovo are also thinking about launching new 
papers. Small publications oriented mainly to other anarchists also seem 
to be developing. This is a good sign as for quite a long time the 
anarchist press was constantly collapsing.</p>

<p>It is necessary to mention that many groups declaring themselves 
"anarchist" do a good job of discrediting the anarchist movement in 
general. Thus at the end of last year, at the Congress of the Association 
of Anarchist Movements (ADA), a group was created called the "Association 
of Anarchist Movements (Marxist- Leninist). No comments about this group, 
but its worth mentioning that many people equate anarchist with various 
foreign Marxist- Leninist guerrillas. Anarchist news bulletins constantly 
inform that this or that "anarchist" group made a protest to support the 
RAF, Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), the IRA, Basque terrorists or Red 
Brigades. Moscow IREAN is particularly notorious for this kind of 
action.</p>

<p>The liberal wing of the anarchist movement also seems to be quite 
confused about anarchist theory. Thus, at the end of last year the St. 
Petersburg Anarcho-Democratic Union declared its support for the 
government's economic "reform" policies. Two Moscow-based libertarian 
capitalist "anarchist" groups - the Moscow Union of Anarchists and the 
Union of Anarcho-Universalists - have degenerated into commercial 
distribution enterprises. The leader of the Moscow Union of Anarchists, 
Alexander Cheryakov, even started publishing an advertising paper full of 
ads featuring "pretty girls for wealthy businessmen."</p>

<p>The conclusion is obvious. The Russian anarchist movement is in a 
terrible state and a lot needs to be done before we can present a real 
alternative to the present destructive developments in Russia and the 
other former Soviet republics. One of the tasks will be a clearer 
definition of what anarchist ideas are and how they can be implemented 
here and now. Surely this process won't lead to the creation of the 
"united anarchism" that some people dream about, but it will help 
activists from different groups try out their ideas. At this point the 
anarchist press both here and abroad is filled with short sloganistic 
manifestos which stand in for serious analysis and careful programs. Today 
the KAS program, adopted in 1989 and devoted mainly to an analysis of the 
Soviet regime, remains the only such consistent attempt to put forward a 
libertarian socialist program. The realities of a "free market" Third 
World capitalism are still waiting to be considered by Russian 
anarchists.</p>

<p>For readers of anarchist publications from other countries Russian 
anarchists may seem rather weird, and so they are. It is quite doubtful 
that anarchists should try to copy all the ideas and actions of their 
comrades in the First World. But surely there is a difference between 
difference and idiocy.</p>

<p>There's a very long way to go, and we should start moving.</p>

<p><b>Wages and Living Standards</b></p>

<p>Inflation in February 1993 was 29 percent a month. A recent economics 
ministry study found that one-third of Russia's population was living 
below the officially defined subsistence level. While prices rose by 26 
times last year, the average wage increased only 13.5 times.</p>

<p>Unemployment continues to grow, but at a slower pace than predicted. 
Russia's "official" unemployed, fewer than 1 percent of the workforce, 
account for only a fraction of the number who are chronically out of work. 
Starved of credits and raw materials, factories shut down for as many as 
several weeks a month rather than carry out mass layoffs.</p>

<p>The Russian government's "solution" to unemployment is a familiar line 
- Women: back to the home." More than 70 percent of Russia's officially 
unemployed workers are women. But Labor Minister Gennady Melikyan says he 
sees no need for special programs to help women return to the workforce. 
"Why should we try to find jobs for women when men are idle and on 
unemployment benefits?" Melikyan said. "Let men work and women take care 
of the homes and their children."</p>

<p>A few years ago women made up 51 percent of the Russian workforce. But 
government cutbacks, aimed largely at middle-level administrative staff, 
have disproportionately hit women. The government's drive to turn women 
back into housekeepers and baby- minders is reflected in a new law on the 
family pending in the Supreme Soviet. The first draft would have nullified 
women's right to abortion and banned women with children from working more 
than 35 hours a week. Following protests from women's and human rights 
groups, the most controversial clauses were dropped, but the current draft 
eliminates the state's obligation to provide day care for the children of 
working women.</p>
