<p class="blackbar">Editorial: Somalia - Chaos or Anarchy?</p>

<p>The United States Marines have landed on the shores of Somalia. This is the third invasion 
carried out by the Bush administration. In each case the people of the U.S. have been subjected to 
sophisticated propaganda campaigns via the media to elicit popular support for these imperialist 
adventures. The invasion of Panama was justified as part of the "war on drugs"; the war on Iraq was 
supposed to punish aggression by "a fiend worse than Hitler"; now, in Somalia, the enemy is chaos 
and anarchy and the goal is a humanitarian one - to feed the starving masses.</p>

<p>But, hold on. There's something wrong with this picture: since when is the U.S. military a 
humanitarian agency? Those guns aren't there for show, they're for killing. Of course, only those 
who resist U.S. beneficence will be blown away.</p>

<p>The propaganda campaign that has accompanied the Somali operation has been slick. Pictures of 
starving children counterposed with those of drug-crazed gun slingers could do nothing but elicit 
sympathy for the victims and hatred for the victimizers. How could any decent human being oppose the 
use of force in such circumstances?</p>

<p>Sure, the U.S. shares responsibility for the disaster. For a decade U.S. arms and food flooded 
Somalia in order to shore up the Barre dictatorship and subsidize his war with Soviet-backed 
Ethiopia over the Ogaden region. This "aid" destroyed agriculture in Somalia leading to the current 
famine. The fall of the Barre dictatorship in 1991, and the clan-based civil war that followed in 
its wake, has led to the current relief crisis. Surely the U.S., as the world's cop, has a 
responsibility to step in and put an end to this "anarchy."</p>

<p>How could any decent person oppose the U.S.'s "humanitarian" intervention (and be assured that 
this is a U.S. operation, albeit behind a United Nations veil)?</p>

<p>Now, nobody likes to see people starve to death and some way has to be found to get food to the 
people, and no one could possibly sympathize the gun thugs who are stealing food and selling it on 
the black market (that's capitalism at its rawest).</p>

<p>But there are reasons for opposing the invasion. The most compelling reason being the precedent 
it sets for future interventions in the third world, both foreign and domestic. Liberia, Bosnia, 
Cambodia, Afghanistan, Georgia, and other areas that are torn by civil strife have already been 
mentioned as areas that require the use of military force to shore up the nation-state against the 
disintegrating effects of ethnic strife. Strife that very often disguises class conflicts.</p>

<p>Our own domestic third world, the inner cities of our metropolitan areas, could also become 
candidates for even greater military occupation in the name of the "war on drugs." No less a 
propagandist for the ruling class than Ted Koppel, in his first report live from Mogadishu, let the 
cat out of the bag when he made a comparison between the drug-crazed teens with guns terrorizing the 
streets of the Somali capital and the gang-bangers of the U.S. inner cities. The inference should 
not be lost here: just as military force was necessary to clean up the gangs in Somalia, it may also 
be the only viable solution to the gang problem in the U.S.</p>

<p>The para-military operation of Darrel Gates' "operation clean sweep" in Los Angeles or the calls 
for the use of the National Guard to clear the gangs out of CHA housing projects in Chicago will now 
be made more palatable by referring to "operation restore hope." Another example of how a 
militaristic foreign policy inevitably rebounds on the domestic front.</p>

<p>Much has been made of the "anarchy" that currently reigns in Somalia. But what exists in Somalia 
is not anarchy but chaos, engendered by the collapse of a central authority and the competition 
between rival gangs to fill in the power vacuum. What is needed in Somalia is not a central state 
authority but grass- roots organizations that can reorganize the economic life of society.</p>

<p>Where are these organizations going to come from? Certainly not from the U.S. military or the UN. 
These bodies are interested in only one thing: restoring the national state known as Somalia, an 
artificial legacy of European colonialism. For the U.S. it's a question of restoring a stable client 
in the strategic Horn of Africa as an asset in its ongoing quest to control the world's oil supply; 
for the UN its a matter of upholding the very idea of the nation-state, its very reason for being 
(for without nation-states, why would you need a "United Nations"?).</p>

<p>But, are a people on the verge of starvation capable of creating the necessary organs for 
survival? This is the crucial question for anarchists and, frankly, this writer doesn't know. All we 
do know is that the statists do not want such self-organization to come about and will do everything 
in their power to prevent it. We also know that the absolute dependence into which the Somali people 
have fallen makes for passivity rather than activism.</p>

<p>The lesson in all this, for anarchists, is the absolute necessity to prepare grass-roots 
organizations: unions, cooperatives, agricultural collectives, self defense groups, etc., in advance 
of any revolutionary crisis brought on by war or any other disaster so that the people will have the 
infrastructure of a new society in place before the collapse of the state comes about.</p>

<p>It may be too late for the Somali people, their neo- colonialist subjugation appears inevitable. 
Perhaps the survivors will, at some future date, take up the struggle for freedom again. But for 
anarchists, particularly those of us in the U.S., the task is to point out the truth - that the U.S. 
is not a humanitarian agency, and its military adventure in Somalia is not for the benefit of the 
Somali people but to serve the long-term interests of the U.S. ruling class. U.S. get out of Somalia 
and North America!</p>
