<p class="blackbar">A Conference in Spain</p>

<p><b>by Mattias Gardell</b></p>

<p>The following article appeared in the December 1992 issue of 
SAC-Kontakt, journal of the Swedish Workers Central-organization, the 
syndicalist federation of Sweden. It was translated for LLR by Christina 
Dagberger of the SAC. The article is significant because it suggests a 
thaw in the relations between the SAC and the IWA (syndicalist 
international federation).</p>

<p><b>Relations with the IWA and CNT</b></p>

<p>The Spanish Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) invited anarchist 
and syndicalist worker-organizations from the entire world to a conference 
in Barcelona in August 1992. When the invitation arrived at the 
Internationella Kommitten (IK - International Committee) it was a clear 
sign that our continuous work over the past years was finally beginning to 
pay off.</p>

<p>The background - which some readers are certainly familiar with - 
consists of a conflict and a series of misunderstandings which since the 
1950's have characterized the relations between Sveriges Arbetares 
Centralorganisation (SAC - the Swedish Workers Central-organization) and 
the International Workers Association (IWA), as well as the split of the 
CNT after the Franco dictatorship's fall, which caused similar fissures in 
larger portions of the anti-authoritarian European workers movement.</p>

<p>The following is a short description of these unfortunate events as 
well as a description of the IK's effort to reach a friendly and 
constructive relationship with the IWA and the CNT. Following that is a 
detailed report from the conference as well as my impressions of the CNT 
and the IWA.</p>

<p><b>The Conflict between the IWA and the SAC</b></p>

<p>The conflict with the IWA (AIT in Spanish) has two sides. Post World 
War II Europe was characterized by the cold war and the well- documented 
attempts of the CIA to influence West European workers organizations into 
an anti-revolutionary and anti-communist direction. In 1952, SAC adopted a 
Declaration of Principles which, compared to its predecessor, was clearly 
more reformist. It was decided the same year by referenda to build a state 
supported unemployment fund, which became reality in 1954.</p>

<p>The IWA, which at that time organized very few working unions (in 
practice only the SAC and the French CNT), and therefore able to hold a 
more "orthodox" anarcho-syndicalist line, disapproved of such 
"co-operation" with the state and supported opposition to this 
reorientation, which not the least came from SAC's older revolutionaries. 
The IWA, which worried about reformist tendencies, decided to give their 
secretariat the responsibility of observing different sections' tactical 
and principal stances.</p>

<p>In Sweden, this was perceived as the beginnings of a centralized, 
opinion watchdog - something completely alien to an anti-authoritarian and 
federal movement. In 1956, the SAC withdrew from the IWA by not paying its 
membership dues.</p>

<p><b>The Spanish Split</b></p>

<p>The Spanish CNT, which during the Franco dictatorship was forced to go 
underground and into exile, returned upon the fascist collapse as the 
revolutionary Anarcho-Syndicalist mass-movement it had once been during 
the 1930's. In the summer of 1977, when the CNT held its first mass 
meeting since the civil war, 300,000 enthusiastic supporters were present 
in Barcelona. Its revolutionary power, however, was soon subdues by 
internal struggles caused by intricate patterns of personal and political 
conflicts. These conflicts escalated until the 1979 congress, where a 
minority (according to the CNT, but a majority according to those who 
became the CGT) of more reform-minded comrades left.</p>

<p>The situation became worse as both groups claimed the name "CNT" as 
well as the resources confiscated by the Franco dictatorship [ie. the 
funds and union buildings included in the "Patrimony" - LLR]. The 
ideological and material legacy conflict was not settled until 1989, when 
a Spanish court rejected the splinter group's claims. They then changed 
their name to Confederation General del Trabajo (CGT).</p>

<p>The Spanish conflict had immediate effects upon the global movement. 
The IWA supported the CNT and anarcho-syndicalist groups in different 
countries split up into enemy camps along the lines of the internal 
Spanish division. Three camps crystallized in Sweden: one pro-CNT, one 
pro-that-was-to-become-CGT, and one completely uninterested or unknowing 
group.</p>

<p>These three groups within SAC were united in their determination not to 
split upon the basis of the Spanish conflict. None other than the 
employers and their collaborators - the reformist unions - would benefit 
if the SAC split. The SAC decided therefore to remain neutral (a Swedish 
tradition wouldn't you say). We regretted the Spanish conflict, but at the 
same time we explained that it could hardly be the Swedish workers 
responsibility to decide which of the opposition groups was the legitimate 
CNT. During the congresses of 1983 and 1990, we declared our intention to 
cooperate and hold channels open to both parts. The Swedish door was open 
for both.</p>

<p><b>The Problems of Neutrality</b></p>

<p>One of the many problems with neutrality is that the decision does not 
appear quite as clear to the groups involved in the conflict seeking 
international support. For those caught up in an intensive, emotional 
struggle, thought of as decisive and a matter of life and death, the lines 
of distinction between good and evil are crystal clear. A naive Swedish 
attitude of we-want-to-be- friends-with-everyone is destined to 
misunderstanding. The thought that anyone who talks to the enemy are my 
enemy, is hard to ignore.</p>

<p>The fact that we even communicated with and visited the "renegades" in 
the soon-to-be CGT was enough for the CNT to suspect Swedish foul play. 
When in 1986, the SAC decided to lend 250,000 SKR [at 1993 exchange rates 
this would be about $35,000 U.S. - LLR] to the soon-to-be CGT - money they 
would use for participating in union elections - the situation became 
interpreted as: "The SAC, those reformists, supports the 
trotskyist/reformists in the splinter group!" That we could just as easily 
have lent money to the CNT was unimportant. The SAC "schemes for those 
traitors and for nothing less than the despicable purpose of the 
Francoist, class-collaborationist institution of union elections." After 
that, many members of the CNT and IWA saw the SAC as a sworn enemy. 
Confusing and vicious rumors, which had the purpose of smearing SAC's 
reputation, soon spread and of course, outraged the Swedish syndicalists 
who were confronted with them. All this created a situation of mutual 
suspicion, misunderstandings and hurt feelings.</p>

<p><b>The IK's Long Range Plans</b></p>

<p>The IK works under these circumstances. In the IK's "International 
Program," which was ratified by the 1990 [SAC] congress, it is clearly 
stated that we are "especially open...to good relationship with 
ideologically similar organizations...both within and outside the IWA." 
Over the years, the IK has participated in many international events. As 
well as much else, we have worked towards building up a working 
co-operation between non- political-party-tied, anti-authoritarian, 
revolutionary unions both in Eastern and Western Europe. This has included 
many trips and meetings where we have either met or contacted IWA 
sections.</p>

<p>Meeting on a personal level has many benefits. As long as the personal 
chemistry works, one soon understands that the other is actually human and 
not the devil that rumors portray. Once a political discussion begins, one 
discovers the other as an anti- authoritarian socialist and a brother in a 
common revolutionary struggle. Details about "who said what to whom in 
1953" lose their importance and a series of misunderstandings can be 
cleared. Slowly, but surely, the SAC and the IWA sections could lower 
their guard and begin to communicate with each other.</p>

<p><b>Untangling a Mess</b></p>

<p>When the CNT invited the SAC to participate in their international 
conference, Certamen Anarquista Mundial (CAM), a milestone was passed 
which clearly marked that we were well on the way to the goal which we had 
set for ourselves - good and constructive relationships with the CNT and 
the IWA. We have much more in common than not. We understood, of course, 
that our presence would be controversial, and I, who had the honor to be 
our representative, prepared myself for many confrontations with hardened 
anarcho-syndicalists who were still caught up in the old patterns of 
conflict. I, however, felt confident that I could accomplish that which I 
set out to do and looked forward to tackling the Spanish bull by the 
horns.</p>

<p>And rest assured, I explained at least a thousand times over our 
position in a series of central points:</p>


<ul>
    <li>No, the SAC does not support the state. We are a
    revolutionary union that fights both capital and the state.</li>
<br>
    <li>No, the SAC does not receive money from the state, however,
    the individual member receives a grant if she becomes unemployed
    ("Oh shit, we have about the same system in Spain...")</li>
<br>
    <li>No, the SAC has not tried to split the Spanish anarcho-
    syndicalist movement. You have done a good job of that yourselves,
    which we regret.</li>
<br>
    <li>No, the SAC did not give money to the CGT so that they could
    participate in union elections. We lent them money but what the CGT
    decided to do with it was their responsibility, not ours.</li>
<br>
    <li>No, the SAC does not participate in union elections. We don't
    even have such a system in Sweden.</li>
<br>
    <li>No, the SAC does not only support the CGT. Just look at the
    decisions of our congress which clearly points to the fact that we
    also want good contacts with the CNT.</li>
<br>
    <li>No, we do not need to take a position in the Spanish
    conflict. The majority of our members are neither knowledgeable of
    nor interested in the conflict. We can not demand that our new
    members begin to study Spanish or Spanish anarcho-syndicalist
    history. We are a working, direct-democratic revolutionary union
    which has other issues that our members find more pressing to
    engage in, such as the struggle in the workplace. For many members,
    it is about as important to take sides in the Spanish conflict as
    it is to decide which of the two guerilla groups in Cameroon to
    support.</li>
<br>
    <li>No, we are not trying to build a new international to compete
    with the IWA. However, we seek constructive co-operation with non-
    political-party-tied, ideologically similar, unions. Be my guest
    and read this yourself in the International Program our congress
    drafted.</li>
<br>
    <li>Yes, our Declaration of Principles in 1952 was more reformist
    than it had been. Did you know that we decided upon a new
    Declaration in 1972 that was ratified 4 years later? No? Be my
    guest, see for yourself. Yes exactly, there is a difference. Not to
    mention that we are revising and updating it now and it will
    hopefully be even more radical and clear.</li>
<br>
    <li>Yes, we have employed functionaries. No, it is not the state
    but our members who pay their salaries. Their salaries are based
    upon the principle of equal pay and we see it as no more reformist
    to work for our own union than to work for a capitalist company.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>And that is how it went. My saving grace was that the Spanish young 
people quickly understood the points and stepped in to correct the older 
members as soon as they saw that I was bombarded with the same questions 
that I had just answered. During the final days, the Spaniards, English 
and French discussed amongst themselves and a clear, positive view of the 
SAC spread throughout the conference. We could unite behind the fact that 
in today's circumstances, where the anti-authoritarian left is the only 
left that is left and therefore the only organized resistance to robber- 
baron-capitalism's havoc, it would be devastating to waste our energy upon 
internal differences when we have a revolution to organize. More about 
these concrete proposals later. It is now high time to get into the actual 
conference.</p>

    <p><b>International Workers Conference</b></p>

<p>Every Swedish syndicalist, who has ever taken part in an international 
conference on the continent, be it in France, Italy, or Spain, are 
acquainted with those special characteristics we associate with problems 
in organizing a conference: an impossible time table, endless 
philosophically oriented arguments which challenge Fidel Castro's 
reputation for length, and poor - if even that - translations (God knows 
that French, Italian and Spanish are international languages spoken by all 
the workers of the world).</p>

<p>Mentally prepared to endure yet another conference under these 
conditions, I was nearly bowled over by my confrontation with the opposite 
reality: the time schedule was respected by the participants and those who 
arrived late blushed in an almost Nordic manner, simultaneous translations 
worked perfectly the entire conference, every session was introduced by a 
prepared leading statement, the following debates were disciplined and for 
the most part pertinent and towards the end a five minute limit was set - 
and it worked!</p>

<p>During three days, we worked with four main themes - the fall of 
planned state capitalism in Eastern Europe; the capitalist crisis in 
general; the situation of the anarchist workers movement; as well as which 
types of methods that we should use to build a dynamic and strong 
anti-authoritarian movement today.</p>

<p>The first two introductions of themes as well as the following 
discussions, were predictable and held no surprises. The SAC and most of 
the other participating organizations and individuals had the same 
analysis and opinions regarding these subjects. The only variation from an 
average Swedish syndicalist debate was the portion which zeroes in upon 
and attacked the church. The process of secularization has come further in 
Sweden than in Spain.</p>

<p>As expected, the last two themes were more interesting. Most of the 
participating organizations presented the situation in their own countries 
under the third theme. Participating in the conference were, among other 
IWA sections, Italy (USI), England (DAM), Germany (FAU), France (CNT) and 
Bulgaria (CNT). There were as well, many autonomous groups and communes 
from Spain, Groupo Malatesta from Portugal, autonomes and anti-fascists 
from Germany, the French Anarchist Federation, Italian railway workers and 
many more.</p>

<p>One interesting topic, among others, which I would like to highlight is 
that of an anarchist school in Estremadura, Spain. We watched a video and 
listened to a pair of teachers who worked there. The presentation was 
impressive. The school was located in town and the children picked up by a 
school bus, just as all the other children in the area. It was directed 
towards a balanced, overall view, with a well thought out pedagogy, which 
was truly revolutionary and a brilliant anarchistic alternative to the 
bourgeois indoctrination that otherwise characterizes the western school 
system. If we had something similar here, I would send my children without 
a moment of hesitation. And why not? We have enough teachers in our 
organization to start similar schools in Sweden, at least in the larger 
cities.</p>

<p>I have two personal reflections concerning the third theme. The first 
is that this conference, despite its global claims, was clearly 
Euro-centered. With two exceptions, Morocco and the Spanish colony in 
Africa (known as the Canary Islands), everyone at the conference was from 
Europe. This points out the importance of attempting to tie new knots and 
establish contact with worker organizations in, above all Asia and Africa 
(we already have got good contacts in America). In this context, we must 
understand that anarcho-syndicalism is a western phenomenon, which is why 
we cannot expect to find groups who actually call themselves 
"syndicalists" or "anarchists." In both Africa and Asia, there are other 
traditions which mean that anti-authoritarian ideas are clothed in other 
words. The second observation, which was immediately noticeable, was that 
the conference was overwhelmingly dominated by men. Not that we have 
anything to brag about but I hope that Swedish anarcha-feminists establish 
contacts with Mujeres Libres, the CNT's "Free Women," who expressed such a 
desire.</p>

<p>The conference ended with more concrete, action-oriented discussion. 
The debate was both intensive and interesting. The same type of 
contradictions that we usually find at home arose: tensions between union 
and political poles, between intellectual and anti- intellectual workers, 
between a men's and women's perspective and between generations. It was 
quite comforting to note that those stances which I thought the sensible 
"won the debate." The importance of a wide and anti-authoritarian 
mobilization against the right-wing was emphasized. In order to realize 
this, we must set dogmatic beliefs aside and be more flexible. Many 
speaker's noted the positive in SAC's participation: we must respect the 
fact that the anarchist workers movement will express itself differently 
in different countries depending upon different circumstances, and find 
the necessary forms for a working co-operation in our common struggle 
against capital.</p>

<p><b>How to Continue?</b></p>

<p>As usual, the unofficial parts of the conference were the most 
rewarding. Many long discussions lighted up the breaks and nights and good 
personal contacts could be made. Those which were most important for the 
SAC and the future deserve to be documented: the unofficial bargaining 
with the CNT and IWA.</p>

<p>The CNT's new general secretary, Jaime Pozas, was easy to get along 
with. He had lived in Sweden where he worked as a cook, and had been a 
member of the SAC. He is therefore quite familiar with the Swedish 
situation. We agreed that we must work towards a good and friendly 
relationship and should cooperate on questions of mutual interest. My 
impression of the CNT is that it is a well working anarcho-syndicalist 
organization - contrary to what is occasionally said by CGT-influenced 
comrades in Sweden. They are similar to us on a series of ideological and 
practical questions, even if there are, naturally, points upon which we 
differ. The CNT is absolutely not a small, orthodox, dogmatic sect; but a 
revolutionary, anarchistic, workers organization which we should take a 
positive stance towards and cooperate with.</p>

<p>The IWA's new secretary, Pepe Jimenez, was even more easy to get along 
with. The IWA's secretariat moved to Valencia after the 1992 IWA Congress. 
We had a very long and constructive meeting where we ventilated opinions 
on everything from the IWA's organization and internal democracy, the 
controversy with the SAC, to a series of burning political questions. We 
soon found that we had similar points of view concerning the most serious 
questions and problems facing the working class today. We also agreed that 
we had everything to gain by cooperating. The SAC's participation in the 
conference is a beginning to normalizing relations between the IWA and the 
SAC. We should begin by cooperating on general questions and slowly work 
towards expanding the level of contact.</p>

<p>Today, the IWA consists of only two working unions, the CNTs in Spain 
and France. The rest are actually best seen as propaganda groups. It is 
also from these propaganda groups - due to that lack of practical 
experience of the realities that a union works under - that the most 
confusing attacks against the SAC come. It is quite clear that we need 
each other - the IWA, the CNT and the SAC!</p>

<p><b>Invitations Delivered</b></p>

<p>I delivered an invitation to both the IWA and the CNT, to come and 
visit Sweden and the SAC to have the opportunity to find out who we really 
are. Likewise, members of the SAC should visit the CNT, travel around in 
the country and form our own opinions instead of listening just to what 
others say. We should also begin working towards the goal of improving our 
contacts with the IWA (including forgiving the mistakes that have been 
made on both sides). In the long run - and when the time is right - my 
personal opinion is that the SAC should seek to be reinstated in the IWA. 
In times such as these, when the supposed "truly existing socialism" has 
fallen, we anti-authoritarian socialists make up the only active 
alternative left! The internationalization of capital must be met with 
international organization and mobilization. An undogmatic and federal IWA 
is a good form for the necessary cooperation. Let us hope that the SAC 
once again can take place where we belong: as part of a world-wide, 
anti-authoritarian, revolutionary workers movement.</p>
