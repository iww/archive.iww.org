<p class="blackbar">The CNT in the Workplace</p>

<p><b>Translated by Jeff Stein for <i>Libertarian Labor 
Review</i>.</b></p>

<p><i>This is the second installment in a three part series about the 
Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo, the Spanish Anarcho-Syndicalist union. 
It is translated from the pamphlet, <u>Anarcosindicalismo, Basico</u>. The 
CNT presently has about 35,000 members.</i></p>

<p><b>The CNT in the Workplaces: The Union Section</b></p>

<p>The CNT members in a workplace are collectively known as the Union 
Section. The union section functions by means of assemblies, in which the 
concrete problems of the union are addressed. In the struggle with the 
employer, the union section must achieve freedom of action, propaganda, 
affiliation and defense of affiliates, the right to hold assembly, and the 
right to sign contracts on the union's behalf. Such is the legal 
environment today, and the state of the union movement, that the CNT has 
to fight day by day to attain former rights now endangered, since the 
employers refuse to recognize the anarcho-union, due to its tactic of 
boycotting the union elections.</p>

<p><b>The Union Elections</b></p>

<p>The union elections were an invention of the employers and the UCD 
government of the time at the end of the 1970s, to regulate the reawakened 
labor movement. After the death of Franco and the collapse of his vertical 
[government-dominated] unions, the country was shaken by a series of 
strikes and mass protests in which the protagonists were primarily, the 
people themselves, and in order to cope with this situation unionism was 
institutionalized.</p>

<p>The largest unions, the UGT and CCOO and the rest, with the exception 
of the CNT, accepted a system of bargaining by means of a new invention: 
the enterprise committee. The enterprise committee is chosen by means of a 
secret ballot between candidates representing the unions. As soon as the 
enterprise committee is chosen, the employer discusses agreements only 
with it. The union elections are held, more or less, every three to four 
years. After the elections, the government announces the results. Only 
those unions which exceed 10% of the votes are given representation to sit 
and discuss and negotiate with the government.</p>

<p>The elections are always won by UGT-CCOO, who number approximately 
200,000 members. Other unions like Basque Workers Solidarity (ELA-STV), 
the USO, the Galician inter-union, or unions of sanitary professions, etc. 
obtain smaller results (between 7,000 and 3,000).</p>

<p>The government evaluates these vote figures in order in order to give 
economic subsidies and to professionalize the unionists who work in its 
facilities. Also the employer by means of collective bargaining, 
subsidizes the enterprise committees and occasionally sits some of its 
members on its board of directors. It is necessary to make clear that the 
CNT does not accept subsidies, neither from the State nor the employer, 
since these are the organizations which must be combatted, and the CNT 
does not want to lose its independence to confront them.</p>

<p>The acceptance of a system of privileges, subsidies, and union 
institutionalization, has after more than a decade led to the practical 
disappearance of the idea of the union as a social transformer, 
because:</p>

<ul>

<li>The union elections remove the power of decision from the people. In 
the workplace only the committee makes decisions during its mandate.</li>
    
<li>The union elections always give victory to the most reactionary 
candidates, who always win in an individual and secret vote.</li>
    
<li>The persons elected to the committee have a fixed term and are not 
subject to any discipline. They represent you although you don't want 
them, they negotiate in your name without your permission, they don't call 
assemblies if they don't want them, they limit what you can discuss or 
agree on with the employer, etc.</li>
    
<li>In consequence, all negotiations are in the hands of the 
committee.</li>

</ul>

<p>The CNT rejects the principle of authority, and therefore, 
representatives with unchecked power. If the CNT were to enter into the 
system of union elections, executive delegates, paid functionaries and 
government subsidies, it would reproduce exactly that which it is trying 
to abolish. The price which the CNT pays for maintaining some consistency 
(total consistency and purity does not exist), was to experience two 
organizational splits by persons who preferred to conform, rather than 
face the difficulties of making progress by anarcho-syndicalist action, 
and instead to build a union based on elections-subsidies-officials. These 
splitters formed what is today the Confederacion General del Trabajo 
(CGT).</p>

<p>In practice, the CGT, while having gained greater freedom, to have 
available funds to pay its functionaries, it has obtained insignificant 
electoral results (0.67% in the last elections with some 1,620 delegates 
in the enterprise committees). According to the laws elaborated by the 
mass sociologists Friedricksen-Hoffman, in a democratic election by 
ballot-box, the candidates most reactionary always win. (First principle 
of secret voting.) If by some heavenly miracle it should gain a higher 
representation, in the course of its mandate it would turn reactionary. 
(Second principle of secret voting.) And if, incredibly, at the end of 
their mandate it would remain progressive it is certain that the next 
election would not repeat the results, and it would be relegated to third 
or fourth place. (Third principle of secret voting.)</p>

<p>If in order to accomplish something it is necessary to vote it should 
always be by raising hands in assembly. The results are always different 
and more beneficial in general, according to anarcho-syndicalist 
ideas.</p>

<p>Another difficulty for the CNT is that its union sections, although 
legal, do not have any rights if they don't participate in the elections. 
Therefore these rights must be won day by day by the section.</p>

<p><b>Daily Activity of the Anarcho-Section.</b></p> 

<p>When a section begins to function, that is to say, when two or three 
members at whatever workplace decide that they are fed up beyond 
endurance, they have to obtain:</p>

<ul>

<li>An understanding of the many problems of their co-workers and to 
become in tune with them. To win simple demands and thus create a sympathy 
towards the section. These questions should be resolved by a direct 
approach, by speaking directly to the boss, supervisor, etc. If this 
doesn't work, the union should intervene with its classical arsenal 
(negotiation-pres-sure-boycott-sabotage-strike etc.), and if for whatever 
reason these don't work, or if the balance of forces are impossible, or if 
it would be necessary to spend more energy than we are ready for, you can 
seek a judicial settlement through the legal representative of the union 
(the local union secretary).</li>

<br>
<li>Legal recognition of the section in regards to the CEMAC and the 
employer. Legalization does not assume an establishment of any guarantee 
nor right. But it permits that in some cases, the union could call a legal 
strike and other activities, and to retain a lawyer.</li>
    
<br>
<li>Identification of the enemy, which is on one side the employer, and on 
the other, in 99% of the cases, the enterprise committee and the rest of 
the unions which collaborate with it. It is necessary to augment the 
contradictions and to not let any pass. But we do not ever lose sight that 
the real enemy is the employer, and that the other unions can have members 
and militants with good intentions.</li>
    
<br>
<li>The section needs to participate in the Health and Safety Committee of 
the center. If one does not exist, then the union should promote its 
creation. One way or the other, the section should elaborate its plans for 
safety on the workplace, and the prevention of sicknesses, and 
accidents.</li>
    
<br>
<li>The collection of full data about the workplace, worker benefits, 
economic plans, redundancies, organizational structure, management 
salaries, habits and characteristics of the boss... This serves, over all, 
to anticipate anti-union plans, and also for the hypothetical 
self-management of the workplace.</li>
    
<br>
<li>The production of bulletins, information leaflets concerning the 
issues, explaining the views of the CNT. The point always is emphasized 
that it is the workers who must decide in the assemblies.</li>
    
<br>
<li>The anarchosection would struggle to make the employer recognize the 
collective representation of the workers, that is to say, that the 
representatives elected by the assembly have the right to negotiate, which 
today is solely in the hands of the Enterprise Committees.</li>
    
<br>
<li>When the Enterprise Committee calls a general assembly, to speak in 
these as the CNT, to win agreement with our proposals. To reject the 
taking of secret votes. The secret vote is always reactionary. In the 
assembly when the vote is open, the people can count for themselves, so 
that nothing can be hidden, they lose their fear and gain a common 
sentiment which can see things clearly.</li>
    
<br>
<li>If the assemblies decide things which go against the position of the 
CNT section, the section would respect the decision if it does not violate 
CNT principles, but we would not agree to it if it does, and we would 
always defend our positions.</li>
    
<br>
<li>If there should come a time in which the incompetence and treason of 
the Enterprise Committee or the institutionalized union is very evident, 
it would be time to plan to overthrow the Committee, and propose that it 
be replaced by direct representation of union sections and by workplace 
assemblies.</li>
    
<br>
<li>In case of a strike, to win a majority, or at least a minority 
presence, on the strike committee. It is necessary that the decision to 
strike be decided by a majority in the general assembly, and that at that 
same assembly a strike committee is named which would be in charge of 
relations between the assembly and the employer. This is the only case 
under the existing labor law, where the employer is obligated to talk with 
the representatives of the assembly. [Otherwise the employer need only 
talk to the Enterprise Committee, which is not bound by the decisions of 
the worker assembly. - Translator's note]</li>

<br>
<li>The section must respect the general assemblies, but not forget that 
we are a union, which organizes workers, and therefore we have our own 
positions.</li>
    
<br>
<li>It is necessary to emphasize that a larger CNT, is the best guarantee 
that the decisions of the assemblies would be respected.</li>
    
<br>
<li>The section must be conscious that a factory assembly can be 
manipulated. If the employer and the other unions see that they are losing 
their positions, they will send into the assembly all their forces: the 
Enterprise Committee, the union sections of the collaborationist unions, 
the foremen, the supervisors, etc. The CNT union section will be accused 
of lacking representation, of not giving alternatives, of being terrorists 
and so forth. This will come about, sooner or later, according to the 
balance of forces and the will to resist. This struggle will not be 
easy.</li> 

</ul>

<p><b>Relations Between the Section & the Union</b></p>

<p>The section names a person who coordinates with the union and its 
committee, another who represents it in dealings with the employer, and 
another who handles funds. In case of problems which exceed the abilities 
of the section, recourse is taken to the union, which is the center of 
life of the anarcho-union, and which sustains the section. In the same 
way, the union can request the aid of the section. The positions follow 
the same pattern as in the union, and it is recommended that these 
responsibilities be rotated throughout the entire section.</p>

<p><b>Workplaces and Sectors Without Enterprise Committees</b></p>

<p>There are places of the "submerged economy", temporary work, etc. There 
are places in which employment hangs by a thread, wages are poor, working 
conditions are unhealthy, and the employers dismiss without a thought any 
who raise their voice. It is advantageous for the section to request the 
aid of the union so that pressure can be exercised by people upon whom 
repression can't fall. In these workplaces direct action often produces 
better results, because judicial means is almost always unhelpful, except 
to demonstrate a firing has been due to anti-union repression. It is 
necessary to make clear that to function as a union in a workplace, does 
not require an all or nothing approach. It includes a trial period. A 
dismissal for union activity, is a dismissal to eliminate a radical, it is 
the only case in which the employer is required to reverse, (if you can 
prove it). The majority of the previous recommendations are also valid 
here, even better, because at times there exist no other unions.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Your Union with Other Local Unions of the CNT</b></p>

<p>In the case in which different unions of the CNT, (construction, 
metalworking, food services, public services, etc.), exist within the same 
city, these join together in what is called a Local Federation (F.L.) 
which coordinates itself by means of a committee. This committee has the 
same duties as the union committee and the same attributes. The local 
committee therefore is an organism of relations, administration and 
development of accords which have been mandated to it. In no case is it an 
executive group.</p>

<p><b>How is the Local Committee Chosen?</b></p>

<p>The local committee is chosen in a Local Plenary Meeting of Unions, a 
meeting of the different local unions (Oficios Varios [General 
Industries], Health, Construction...) with mandated delegations, limited 
to written instructions taken previously in their respective assemblies. 
This assembly of delegations names a general secretary and treasurer. The 
rest of the responsibilities: press, education, archives, legal, etc. are 
covered by a person from each union branch.</p>

<p>The Local Plenary Meeting of Unions makes decisions within local 
limits. For this it is necessary that the unions hold their respective 
assemblies and come to agreements beforehand. The Local Plenary Session is 
convoked by petition of a union to the local committee.</p>

<p>What happens if there is only one General Industrial union in a 
locality? The union in question can gather with other nearby localities 
and form a district federation, with the same attributes as a local 
federation.</p>

<p><b>Means of Relation and Coordination Between Local Federations: The 
Regional Confederation</b></p>

<p>When various unions of a particular geographic entity establish 
relations, they form a Regional Confederation of Labor. For example, the 
Regional Confederation of Labor of Andalucia-Canarias. The geographical 
limits can be modified by the will of the unions, and regions can be 
merged (this requires the agreement of both regions), just as they can 
divide themselves (if desired by 75% of the unions).</p>

<p>The unions of the Regional Confederation make decisions in common by 
means of the Regional Plenary Meeting of Unions. The delegations of the 
different regional unions carry the direct responses of agreements taken 
by writing at their own assemblies. The Regional Plenary Meeting of Unions 
is responsible for deciding all the questions within its respective 
geographical limits. To provide coordinative activities, the plenary 
meeting names a person who represents the regional confederation, who acts 
as general secretary of a regional committee. At the same time a locality 
is elected to be to be regional headquarters. The rest of the secretaries 
of the regional committee, (treasury, legal, prisoner-defense...) are 
elected in a plenary meeting of local unions where headquarters is 
located, and each union names a person to carry out the duties. It is a 
little complicated, but perhaps an example would clarify things:</p>

<p>The "Oficios Varios" [General Industrial] unions of Cadiz, Sevilla, 
Grenada, Cordiba, Jaen and fifty more from different localities, meet in 
the Regional Plenary Meeting and name Juana Perez, from the SOV of Cadiz, 
as regional secretary for the Regional Confederation of Labor of Andalucia 
Canarias, and designate the Local Federation in Cadiz as headquarters. The 
Local Fedration of Cadiz is composed of unions in Metal, Construction, 
Graphic Arts, "Oficios Varios," Public Service, Chemicals and 
Retirees.</p>

<p>These unions meet in Local Plenary Meeting and elect the rest of the 
secretaries proposing a person from each one of these.</p>

<p>Together these secretaries (General, organization, legal, information, 
archives, etc.) form what is called the Permanent Secretariat, which 
together with the local secretaries of the region, form the Regional 
Committee.</p>

<p>The Regional Committee is an organ of coordination, management, and 
administration. It can not make decisions nor agreements. It can only work 
on the tasks it has been assigned. It can be recalled at any moment, by a 
plenary meeting of the total region which could question the continuation 
of the committee. It would have a maximum duration of three consecutive 
years and is always followed by a new elected one, it would have to be 
approved by a regional plenary meeting afterwards. The members of the 
committees can not make proposals to the plenary meetings and assemblies. 
It must be made clear that the sovereignty of the Regional Confederations 
always rests with the industrial unions.</p>

<p>The functions of the Regional Committee are the same as in the other 
committees, except for the greater geographical area that it 
encompasses.</p>

<center><p><b>Relations Between Different Regional 
Confederations</b></p></center>

<p><b>The National Confederation</b></p>

<p>The different regional confederations which operate within the borders 
of power dominated by the Spanish state, form the National Confederation 
of Labor [CNT]. The regional confederations reach agreements in the 
National Plenary Meeting of Regions, which delegations attend with 
agreements written in their respective Regional Plenary Meetings of 
Unions. The National Plenary Meeting of Regions has the capacity to make 
agreements within its geographical limits and to name a national general 
secretary and a local federation to be the headquarters of the National 
Committee.</p>

<p>For example: The confederations of Gallega, Murciana, Astur-leonesa, 
etc., meeting in a national plenary of regions elects Belinda Fernandez of 
the Metalworkers of Barcelona, as general secretary of the CNT. The 
headquarters of the National Committee is relocated to the Local 
Federation of unions in Barcelona, which is composed of 32 unions, and 
which meets in a local plenary to elect the rest of the secretaries. These 
people, Belinda Fernandez and the others elected from Barcelona, form the 
Permanent Secretariat of the National Committee of the National 
Confederation of Labor. The rest of the National Committee consists of the 
general secretaries from each region. The functions of this committee are 
the same as those previously explained for other committees and are bound 
by the same limitations.</p>

<p><b>Why are Committees Elected this Way?</b></p>

<p>It is done this way to avoid homogeneous committees. Other 
organizations elect slates of candidates, factions and programs, build 
coalitions to win office and from there gradually promote the politics of 
the winning side. According to anarcho-syndicalism, however, committees 
should have neither programs nor politics. The direct election on the part 
of the unions guarantees the heterogeneity and diversity of the committee. 
Any type of representation involves some executive power, but the CNT 
minimizes the power in the hands of the more active and informed 
individuals.</p>

<p><b>How Do the Unions of the CNT Make Decisions?</b></p>

<p>By means of the CNT Congress. To the congress come the direct 
representatives of the unions independently of the region or local to 
which they belong, with written agreements from their own previous 
assemblies. The congress decides over the general activity of the CNT to 
avoid different regional confederations acting against each other. The 
congress can also choose a new national committee and decide on as many 
matters that seem relevant to the unions. From its foundation in 1910, the 
anarcho-union has celebrated seven congresses, the last three since the 
death of Franco.</p>

<p>The congress is convoked by the National Committee when there exists 
sufficient necessity, when new or contradictory situations have arisen 
which require a response. Then it is convoked a year ahead of time, the 
convocation is ratified by a National Plenary of Regions, the themes for 
discussion are presented and a debate commences within the unions some 
seven months before the opening date. The congresses of the CNT are always 
very tempestuous. Usually the first sessions deal with technical matters, 
how to vote, how the discussions will proceed, which delegations will be 
accepted, the reading of greetings. It is also traditional that the 
members repeat and defend their agreements to the point of congestion, 
which leads to a passionate atmosphere.</p>
