<p class="Blackbar">Principles of Libertarian Economics: Part 3</p>

<p><b>by Abraham Guillen (translated by Jeff Stein)</b></p>

<p><i>This is the final installment in this three-part series. Part I ran 
in LLR #14, Part II in LLR #15.</i></p>

<p><b>Information and Self-government</b></p>

<p>A self-managed economy will have to rationally organize the branches of 
industry and, within each one, integrate the small and medium enterprises 
with the big enterprises to constitute a unified whole. For example, in 
the branch of industry of domestic electronics, which seems to have no 
relationship with the construction industry, it may be suitable to control 
home heating and cooling not with individual refrigeration and individual 
furnaces but centrally, with the goal of saving energy. In this sense, the 
construction industry, to construct new housings, would build them to work 
in the manner of hotels, with all included services, so the worker would 
live similar to a present day bourgeois in a great hotel. For this to 
happen it would be necessary to increase the productivity of labor in the 
primary and secondary sectors, so that each worker in agriculture and in 
industry would be capable of producing for many people so that, in 
compensation, they would proportion him the necessary services of a sort 
of social hotel, as we have indicated. But for this to happen will require 
a great revolution in culture and technology, investing much in Research 
and Development.</p>

<p>The self-managed economy will have to invest a good portion of the 
national income in the production of both consumer and capital goods, 
particularly in its first years of operation, so that the productivity of 
the labor is increased to unprecedented levels. In this order of ideas, 
economic growth, with libertarian socialism, would be greater than with 
private capitalism or State capitalism, since the surplus-value wasted on 
the parasitic classes under capitalism would be invested instead. 
Consequently, it wouldn't be necessary to harshly tighten the belts of the 
workers, as did Stalin; instead the gross national or social income would 
increase annually in greater proportion than under industrialized 
capitalism or bureaucratic socialism (which wastes too much in armaments, 
in salaries of unproductive officials, and slows economic growth to no 
greater a pace than that of the developing capitalist countries).</p>

<p>By means of the application of information and of computer networks, 
well supplied with all types of data, the Federative Council of the 
Economy would have the actual information for each branch of production or 
of services. Therefore, the economic integration of branches of production 
and of service would be a positive science, which would know everything 
necessary in order to avoid crisis of disproportional of growth in those 
branches, without the production of excesses of personal, of goods not 
sold, or of raw materials, since it would be known, at each moment, the 
amount necessary to produce, to distribute or invest so that the social 
economy has a law of harmonious development.</p>

<p>For example, the central computers of the Federative Council of 
Economy, with informative contributions of the computer terminals in local 
factories, provincial and regional, would make known what was everyone's 
production, reserves and shipments to the self-managed market. In the case 
of the industry for manufacturing of paper containers, the central 
computer would register the number of establishments, the personnel 
employed in each one of them, total of work-hours, cost of the personnel 
in stable monetary units, electric power consumed in the process of 
production, value of the fuels and gas used, value of the consumed raw 
materials, general expenses, taxes, value of the total production, value 
of the employed labor, amounts destined to pay debts and for new 
investments. In sum: programming the economy would be simple, without need 
of bureaucrats, of capitalist managers or of technocrats.</p>

<p>When we speak of taxes we don't refer to the tribute of the western 
capitalist type nor to the business taxes (mainly figured as a business 
expense usurped from the enterprises by the State in the USSR and in the 
"popular republics that made up the COMECON), but to the delivery of a 
pre-determined quota of the economic surplus, extracted by the 
self-managed enterprises, transferred to the self-governments, responsible 
for returning those transfers to society in social and public services 
according to their ability: sanitation, hygiene, paving of streets, 
highways, roads, ports, railroads, education, public health and other 
responsibilities of the self-governments which would be too great to 
enumerate.</p>

<p><b>Labor-Value Money</b></p>

<p>In this case we would attempt to strengthen the economy of the free 
self-managed municipality, not in the traditionally Roman [state-citizen] 
nor modern bureaucratic sense, but as the social and public enterprise of 
the citizens; as well as the industrial, agricultural, of research 
enterprise or certain global services which would constitute the task of 
the associated workers with their means of production, self-organized into 
Worker Councils of Self-Management and in Basic Units of Associated Labor, 
where the economic accounting should be automated by means of computers 
and take as their unit of calculation, the labor-hour (LH). It would have 
thus a monetary equivalence of the same value, if the money is intended to 
remain stable. The LH would circulate monetarily in the form of ticket 
which would give the right to consume reasonably, always leaving an 
important portion in order to invest more capital than wornout during a 
year, so that libertarian socialism would enlarge the social capital, with 
the goal of progressing more with self-management than under the dominance 
of capitalists or of bureaucrats.</p>

<p>The LH, as labor-money, wouldn't lead to monetary inflation like 
capitalist money or like the soviet ruble, which conceal by being the 
money of cass, the parasitical incomes of the western bourgeoisie, or of 
the eastern bureaucracy, inflating the growth of the gross national 
product (GNP), with salaries of officials or unproductive technocrats, or 
with dividends, interests, rents and surplus values received by the 
capitalists, according to the western economic model, where each day there 
exist a growing parasitical class at the expense of productive workers. 
Every project of investment would be calculated in hours of labor (LH), as 
well as in terms of personal and public consumption required. It would be 
monitored that neither would be excessive in the carrying on of a 
libertarian, self-managed society, of direct associative democracy, so 
that a part of the global economic surplus would be invested in achieving 
a greater automation of industrial production and of agricultural 
production. It would thus be possible to continue reducing the working day 
to a range which would allow a more leisure time, so that all the citizens 
could occupy their time in more relaxation and, above all, in better 
scientific, cultural and technological preparation.</p>

<p>The LH, as labor-money and as a quantification of the economy, having a 
stable monetary value would program the economy: to account it; to 
establish the costs of the goods and services; programming the integrated 
branches of the division of the labor and correct disharmonies between 
them; quantifying in the products the cost of raw, energy, amortization of 
the capital, value of the work, economic contributions to the local 
self-governments and to the national co-government, etc. All of this would 
function within a libertarian socialism of a self-managed market, without 
speculators, hoarders or merchants, in order that competition benefit the 
workers and the consumers, the cooperative groups and self-managed 
enterprises, in the manner similar to the way the market functioned in the 
Spanish libertarian collectives during the Spanish Revolution of 1936-39. 
The goal would be to avoid the bureaucracy of a centrally planned economy, 
such as occurred in the USSR and China, where the officials decided 
everything and the people participated in nothing. As if that were 
socialism, however much they try to introduce it thus by means of a 
totalitarian propaganda, as if lies could be converted into truths by 
force of repeating them as the only truth, thanks to the state monopoly of 
the radio, the press, the television, the universities, the schools, so 
that Power regulates knowledge according to their political 
convenience.</p>

<p>In a libertarian economy, labor-money wouldn't be money in the 
capitalist sense such as we understand it and need it today, since it 
wouldn't allow the individual accumulation of capital in order to exploit 
the labor of other people and obtain a surplus value. Rather it would be 
intended to facilitate the exchange of goods and service, in a 
self-managed market, where these exchange at their true labor value, so 
that it fulfill economically the law of equal exchange in equality of 
condition for all the integrated branches of the social division of the 
labor and the law of the cooperation of those same branches or federations 
of production and of service. If, on the other hand, there were no free 
operation of the self-managed market, things would fall into economic 
chaos, by trying to centrally plan everything. Prices and their economic 
calculation, as well as the market that really forms them (without 
maintaining bureaucratic costs) are only possible within an indicative 
global programming, but which leave the day-to-day market free, so that 
all the enterprises are able to produce the best and most economically, 
about which the consumers must ultimately decide. From this method, there 
is an invisible hand which self-regulates the social economy, better than 
thousands of officials and technocrats equipped with thousands of 
computers who without liberty, order disorganization by being poorly 
informed or because of the self-interests of the totalitarian bureaucracy, 
who manage more like inquisitors or cruel police (as happened in the USSR 
and China).</p>

<p>If the LH, the unit of labor-money, would have, for example, an 
purchasing power of 1 hour of average social-labor and this were 
equivalent, roughly speaking, to one dollar, one could establish, among 
others, the following calculation of economic-accounts:</p>

    <ul><b>Calculation in (LH) of an Industrial Enterprise</b>
    <li>Costs of machinery = $1000 = 1000 LH</li>
    <li>Raw materials, energy, etc. = $50,000 = 50,000 LH</li>
    <li>Hours worked in production = 50,000 LH</li>
    <li>Total of LH = 101,000 LH</li>
    <li>Units produced during the period of work = 100</li></ul>

<p>Dividing the total number of LH, spent in the process of production, 
and the total of units produced in that time of work which could be daily, 
monthly, or yearly, we would have an average of labor value for unit 
produced of 1.010 of LH or of labor-money.</p>

<p>Now then, as no money could be absolutely stable, since if the 
productivity of the labor increases, due to improvements in machines, 
education of the workers and more efficient methods, it would result that 
the LH will end up having less value of exchange, increasing its value of 
use, driving this economic process toward an economy of abundance where, 
overcoming venal value, the value of use would only remain. Consequently, 
having reached this stage in the economy and technology, with most of the 
work automated, the value of the produced goods wouldn't be based much on 
living labor, but almost everything would be labor of the past 
(accumulated capital), which would determine thereby a self-regulated 
production of abundance. Then the wonderful time will have arrived of 
overcoming finally both money and the commodity, each man receiving 
according to his necessity, although he only contributes according to his 
unequal capacity, or in other words, that it would make possible the 
economic equality between the men: libertarian communism, rationally and 
scientifically, economically possible, without which it must considered as 
a beautiful utopia.</p>

<p>Only a self-managed economy, rational and objective, based on 
scientific laws, from the commencement of the establishment of libertarian 
socialism, avoiding the fall into one phase or another, into either the 
socialism of group property, into forms of corporatism or of narrow 
syndicalism, but towards a condition of always placing the general 
interest above the particular interest of the professional or work 
groups.</p>

<p><b>The Libertarian Society</b></p>

<p>On the subject of the future of a libertarian and self-managed society, 
Kropotkin warned and advised:</p>

    <blockquote>We are convinced that the mitigated individualism of the
    collectivist system will not exist alongside the partial
    communism of possession of all of the soil and of the
    instruments of labor. A new form of production will not
    maintain the old form of redistribution. A new form of
    production will not maintain the old form of consumption,
    just as it will not accommodate the old forms of
    political organization.</blockquote>

<p>In this order of ideas, explains Kropotkin, the private ownership the 
capital and of the earth are attributes of capitalism. Those conditions 
were consistent with the bourgeoisie as a dominant class, although the 
public [state] ownership of capital and of the earth is consistent with 
the capitalism of the soviet-State, which elevates the totalitarian 
bureaucracy as a new dominant class.</p>

<p>The private ownership of the means of production and of exchange 
created capitalism as a mode of production and the bourgeoisie as dominant 
class.</p>

<p>"They were", says Kropotkin, "the necessary condition for the 
development of the capitalist production; it will die with her, although 
some may try disguising it under form of a 'labor bonus'. The common 
possession of the instruments of labor will bring necessarily the common 
enjoyment of the fruits of the common labor." (<u>The Conquest of 
Bread</u>, p.28)</p>

<p>If upon changing the mode of production and of distribution, daily life 
doesn't change, including distribution, consumption, education, the 
political system, the legal and social, in the sense that one dominant 
classes are not substituted by other, then, really, nothing essentially 
has changed. Thus it happened in the Soviet Union, where the economic 
categories and the economic laws of the capitalism were hardly modified, 
with the result that the economic dictatorship of the bourgeoisie was 
replaced with the political and economic dictatorship of the bureaucracy 
and, in consequence, private or anonymous capitalism for the capitalism of 
State. A revolution like this, although it is called socialist, 
constitutes a great swindle to the detriment of working people, for whom 
in the majority of cases, it has not meant more than a change of master or 
of a saddle, to the unfortunate beast of burden. So instead of being the 
proletarian of the bourgeois, they have a new Patron, that is to say, the 
technocrat and the bureaucrat. In our way of thinking, the alternative to 
capitalism is not Marxism Leninism, but libertarian socialism.</p>

    <p><b>The True Social Revolution</b></p>

<p>For a revolution to be true, in the sense of emancipating working 
people from the oppression and exploitation of the dominant classes, it 
has to establish a new mode of production, exchange, distribution and 
consumption and create new social relationships; new and more powerful 
productive forces; new political forms of popular direct participation; 
new legal institutions having as their basis the popular jury, new 
universities and technical schools integrated with industries, 
agriculture, mining, energy, fishing, the forests and other sectors; new 
philosophic, political,social, artistic, and cultural doctrines; new 
conceptions of national and social defense based more on the people in 
arms (than on a bureaucratic professional army, expensive and wasteful) in 
order to defend the society, as much inside as outside of it. It is 
necessary to affirm the system of popular self-defense, since without 
which there couldn't be a guarantee that self-management will be accepted 
by a professional army, the latter always having tendencies to stage a 
"coup" in order to take Power.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in order to avoid the coming to power of a 
one-Party-state, which is the worst and greatest single political wrong, 
as happened in the USSR, there will need to be created a participatory 
socialism. This would entail a respect for the free personality within the 
collective, the self-determination of the local governments within a 
federalism which coherently maintains a unified market, the social and 
national self-defense, diplomatic relations with the exterior, the 
socio-economic system as a relatively homogeneous regime. A federalism 
which keeps a national and social accounting system in order to estimate 
and program the authentic valuation of the national or social global 
income, making it possible to know where we have been and toward where we 
are going economically, socially, politically, scientifically and 
technologically.</p>

<p>But a new economic system, based on self-managed socialism, will have 
to have another way of estimating the annual economic growth on the basis 
of short, medium and long term plans, constructing a macro-economic 
picture of the national and social economy, departing from the known 
figures and projecting toward figures to be attained in the next 
trimesters, semesters, years. Thus the future, in certain manner, will be 
anticipated by having a Federative Council of the Economy, where each 
federation of production or of services knows that which it has and that 
which it wants, in accordance with the effective demand of the 
self-managed market. Libertarian socialism, if it wants to distinguish 
itself from authoritarian soviet communism, must respect the law of the 
supply and demand, without falling into bourgeois liberalism, since in the 
self-managed market the federations of production and of social and public 
services act competitively. Because if the market is suppressed, and with 
it the law of labor-value, the law of economic competition, the law of 
formation of just prices in the market, it would not be possible establish 
a rational economy of costs and prices, necessary investments and 
appropriate consumption. In its place would be a centralized and 
bureaucratic planning which places the total-State above the oppressed, 
exploited Society, as happened in the USSR under a planning of economic 
decrees, without respect for objective economic laws.</p>

<p>On the other hand, libertarian socialism has to respect the pluralism 
of ideas, although it wouldn't provide a space for byzantine struggles. 
People would be self-organized in their own interest in self-managed 
enterprises, mutual cooperatives, local self-governments and all types of 
socio-economic and political forms of direct participation. Politics would 
be deprofessionalized, abolishing the political class and the political 
parties as expression of antagonistic interests, since each citizen or 
worker will participate in their enterprise, local self-government, 
federation, daily, without falling into the trap of electoralism, where 
they only participate for a day to elect a government worse than 
another.</p>

<p><b>Traps of Bourgeois Economics</b></p>

<p>Libertarian socialism will have to create a new economic doctrine and a 
new system of estimating the national or social income. Actually, the 
concept of gross national product (GNP), of which there is so much talk 
and is so little understood, counts in unstable monetary units, the total 
of the goods and services obtained by economic activity: agriculture, 
industry, services, as large integrated sectors of the national 
economy.</p>

<p>If the GNP, the way it is constituted in the bourgeois economy, were 
estimated in monetary units of constant purchasing power, thus deflating 
the official figures, it is possible that it actually diminishes instead 
of increasing. On the other hand, the GNP, in its bourgeois form, includes 
the economic participation of the unproductive "tertiary" and "quaternary" 
sectors, in the sense not that this should be concealed, but that the GNP 
shows "growth" when it may have diminished materially, in effective 
production. Thus, for example, in many countries which are diminishing 
their industrial and agricultural production during some years, but if 
salaries increase and the number of tertiaries in the state bureaucracy, 
commerce, the banks, and in social and public services grow, it is said 
that the GNP has grown, for example, an annual 3%, when the reality is 
that this macro-economic figure only represents salaries, incomes without 
effective work, surplus values taken, parasitic income , etc.</p>

<p>Libertarian socialism, creating a social economy based on truthful 
figures, would have to estimate the GNP in a different manner than the 
capitalists. It is necessary to give to the concept of social income, 
units which are measured or concrete and in constant money based on 
material output: agriculture, cattle raising, forests, fishing, energy, 
mining, industry, or whatever is actual production. As for the "services", 
only transportation, railroads, trucking, marine and air would be included 
in the concrete estimate of the effective or material income, since 
although transportation doesn't add production, it transports it from one 
side to another and, in consequence, it should be included in the concrete 
income of one year to another.</p>

<p>Adding the concrete income alongside gross income (administrative 
"services", commerce, banks and other social and public services), it 
would be seen if these take too great a percentage in the total income by 
having too many unproductive personal who, in order to not drain the 
social economy, would have to be recycled as productive personnel. Now 
then, in the "services" which could be considered as productive, would be 
included the personnel destined for Research and Development (R &D), 
without whose presence an economy will stagnate for lack of economic and 
technological progress; but the personnel of R&D should be, besides in the 
Institutes or Centers (which tend to be bureaucratic and technocratic), 
directly in the industrial enterprises, agricultural, energy, forests, 
mining, fishing, etc., since science and technique should be united 
directly to labor as immediate factors of production and not as though the 
ostentation of an academic title should make one a technocrat.</p>

<p>In sum, the net income of a country would have to be estimated, in a 
libertarian socialism, at costs determined in relatively stable physical 
and monetary units which don't mislead, deducting the necessary 
investments of social capital in order to enlarge production and not 
simple reproduction as happens to the bourgeois economy in a crisis.</p>

<p>The estimate of the national and social income must be transparent: 
from the total of the wealth created in a year must be deducted the 
material consumption of people and that of self-administration (where 
there should not be much bureaucracy, by reason of better information) and 
to deduct, set aside or remove the social or national saving destined for 
investment in order to increase the reproduction of effective wealth, 
create new enterprises, design improved and more productive machines, 
carry on scientific investigation, automate industrial production and 
public services, and mechanize and electrify agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Liberation of the Working People</b></p>

<p>In sum, the libertarian economy should liberate the worker from their 
old employers, either private managers or from the State as Manager, to 
end that the workers, by means of their Self-Management Enterprise 
Councils, direct the economy which they create with their labor upon the 
means of production associated, from the bottom up, by means of the 
federations of production and of social services composed in a Federative 
Council of the Economy; only thus could there be planning and liberty, an 
associative democracy of full participation of the working people, a 
self-managed socialist society, avoiding any form of totalitarian 
communism (which, as a matter of fact, is capitalism of the State).</p>

<p>Without economic liberty there can't be political liberty; since with 
capitalism there is an economic dictatorship of a plutocratic minority 
over the majority of working people; and with capitalism of the State, in 
the soviet manner, the State exploits and oppresses Society by means of 
the one-Party which is a bad one for the majority and a good one for the 
bureaucratic, oppressive and exploitive minority. The solution is: neither 
totalitarian communism nor capitalism but self-management, direct 
democracy, federalism and socialism.</p>

<p class="redbar">An Afterword by the Translator</p>
    
<p><b>by Jeff Stein</b></p>

<p>Abraham Guillen has given us some useful concepts for analyzing the 
economic systems of state-socialist and corporate capitalist countries. 
Although these economies are no longer dominated by individual capitalist 
owner-managers, they remain exploitive, class systems. According to 
Guillen, ownership of the means of production is now collective, spread 
across a stratum of "techno-bureaucrats". These techno-bureaucrats are 
just as much concerned with accumulating capital through exploitation of 
workers, as the old "robber baron" capitalists. However, the surplus of 
the system is shared (although not on an equal basis) within the 
techno-bureaucratic class. Under these systems, legal ownership means less 
than one's position in the state or corporate hierarchy. Only a system of 
worker self-management of their own workplaces, can eliminate this 
exploitation by the techno-bureaucracy.</p>

<p>This does not mean Guillen's theory is without problems. His proposals 
for a "market without capitalists" and the establishment of "labor-money" 
are built open the assumption that the labor theory of value can provide 
the basis for a libertarian socialist economy. The labor theory of value 
provides a powerful argument for the elimination of capitalists and 
bureaucrats, since their incomes represent an unnecessary drag on the 
economy. However, in a self-managed economy inequalities having nothing to 
do with labor productivity would arise between self-managed enterprises, 
giving some a competitive advantage over others. For instance, the size of 
the enterprise, the availablity of scarce raw materials, the presence or 
absence of strict environmental regulation by the local municipality, 
etc., would all come into play, and these are not always factors which are 
easily calculated in labor-hours.</p>

<p>Augustin Souchy, another anarcho-syndicalist who made extensive studies 
of various attempts at establishing workers self- management, observed 
that:</p>

    <blockquote>working hours as the only value determinant is
    unrealistic. Experience shows that the lack of raw
    material, rarity of quality, differences of consumer
    goods, highly qualified services, etc. are equally vague
    determinants. These factors will not change in a
    socialist economy." (Beware! Anarchist!, Chicago, 1992.
    p.42)</blockquote>

<p>One factor which is becoming increasingly important in determining 
production costs is energy. As the amount of labor decreases due to 
automation, the amount of energy in terms of fossil fuels, electricity 
required, etc., increases. This means that while the labor value of many 
products is going down, their energy value is going up. As long as energy 
is cheap and abundant, this does not necessarily present a problem. 
However, in the future, as the southern hemisphere becomes increasingly 
industrialized and there is a greater demand for energy, and as fossil 
fuel supplies dwindle, a purely labor-based system of economic accounting 
would collapse. Energy would either have to be rationed, or some sort of 
global federation would have to set a tax on energy. Either way, the 
labor-exchange economy would be forced away from an unregulated market 
system. On the other hand, the sort of energy accounting based system 
proposed by some "green" economists is not adequate either, since the 
energy theory of value does not take into account the qualitative 
difference between human energy (labor) and non-human energy.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a perfectly, objective theory of economic 
value. Each theory has its own hidden biases which will tend to skew the 
results of any accounting system (this includes the bourgeois 
scarcity-value system, which favors those who own capital and scarce 
resources). The best a labor theory of value can do is identify that part 
of a thing's (a good or service) value, which is the result of social 
production. The rest of a thing's value is contributed by energy, nature, 
the social infrastructure, and a host of other variables. In a 
libertarian, self-managed economy, the accounting of these non-labor costs 
and the distribution of these benefits, therefore needs to go beyond the 
individual workplaces and their labor accounts. An economic role must be 
played by the free municipalities (communes), who must set democratic 
controls over energy, environmental standards, and scarce resources, in 
order to make sure that those exchanges which take place do not undermine 
social equality or the capacity of the earth to sustain itself. Therefore, 
contrary to Guillen, we should insist that whatever exchange or currency 
system exists in the future, it provide for greater community control and 
allow all citizens a voice as to how value should be determined.</p>
