<p class="blackbar">Britain's Direct Action Movement</p>

<p><i>Editorial Note: The following article appeared in Number 4 of 
K.S.L., the bulletin of the Kate Sharpley Library. The Kate Sharpley 
Library publishes several interesting pamphlets on syndicalism in Britain 
and other countries. Here is their website:</i></p>

<p>The DAM (British section of the International Workers Association) was 
founded in 1979. The founders of the DAM, which included the Manchester 
Syndicalist Workers Federation, rump of what had been since the 40s a 
national organization, recognized the need for better organization and for 
anarchists to address working class issues in a more coherent way than the 
existing Anarchist Federation (last of many such attempts) which was 
grounded in disorganization and with too many interested only in pacifism 
and the punk scene. In a way, the DAM could be said to have fulfilled part 
of its original aims. The DAM's early years were spent in finding its feet 
and consolidating the organization as well as intervening in industrial 
disputes wherever possible.</p>

<p>The big break for the DAM came with the miners' strike [in 1984]. This 
had a twofold effect. Firstly it shook a lot of the anarchist movement out 
of its life-stylist torpor and into activity. More importantly for the DAM 
it showed the relevance of syndicalist ideas for the British working 
class. The sterling work done by DAM members and other anarchists won them 
the respect of many of the most militant miners.</p>

<p>The middle to late eighties saw a number of other disputes which the 
DAM supported, including Kent Messenger, Silent Night Traders, Meathouse 
and the printers' dispute at Wapping. Particular mention must be made of 
the Ardbride workers. DAM members mounted a consumer boycott of Laura 
Ashley, Ardbride's chief customer, which was later mounted internationally 
through the IWA. This forced Laura Ashley to threaten Ardbride and force 
them to make concessions. Unfortunately, the union (for recognition of 
which the workers had been fighting) called off the strike at a critical 
moment and the strikers failed to get their jobs back.</p>

<p>Experience of these disputes led the DAM to develop a new industrial 
strategy. This broke decisively with the previous syndicalist tactic of 
working within the [TUC] unions. The unions were seen by the DAM as beyond 
reform and to have failed the working class. New strategies are needed, 
based on direct action, workplace assemblies, and strike committees. The 
first step is to form 'industrial networks' of militants in the service 
industry whose long-term aim is to form an anarcho-syndicalist union. (The 
change of direction was not unanimous and a number of people left the DAM, 
some of whom went on to set up the short-lived Anarchist Workers 
Group.)</p>

<p>The DAM tried to implement this strategy over the last few years, with 
mixed success. Workplace groups, which would be the basic building block 
of any union, have yet to be established. Nor is the DAM able to develop 
the ideas much further than at present. This is in part due to the nature 
of the DAM--a political group with its own share of dogmatism. But it is 
also because any further development must come from the practice of 
workers organizing rather than the theory of those who aren't.</p>

<p>This lack of progression on the industrial front is linked to the DAM's 
high turnover of members, and stagnation of the last few years. However, 
the DAM was never going to be perfect and it's easy to criticize such 
things as the poor internal education, but it doesn't look so bad compared 
to other anarchist groups.</p>

<p>The DAM has been involved in a number of campaigns where it had a 
disproportionate influence to its numbers. In the anti-Poll Tax movement, 
the only challenge to the dead hand of the Militant [a British Trotskyite 
group] came from the DAM. Needless to say, others who hadn't heard of the 
Poll Tax before Trafalgar Square were quick to claim responsibility. Nor 
will it surprise us when the historians say these organized it!</p>

<p>DAM played a capital role in the re-launching of Anti-Fascist Action, 
the organization which actually fights fascists rather than just talking 
about fascism (or shouting at fascists, like the SWP- organized Anti-Nazi 
League).</p>

<p>Whatever the future of the DAM, it has certainly made a great 
impression on the anarchist movement in Britain. Anarchists are now better 
organized than they were in 1979. The task now is not to organize the 
anarchists, but for the workers to organize.</p>

<p><i>LLR Note: The author unfortunately left out DAM's one industrial 
success, the Despatch Industry Workers Union. DAM members successfully 
organized a number of urban messenger businesses in the early 90s. A 
report on the DIWU was printed in LLR No. 10. A pamphlet published by DAM 
on its industrial strategy, Winning the Class War, was reviewed in LLR No. 
13.</i></p>
