<p class="blackbar">Notes on Anarchism in America, Part 2</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>In the first installment of these notes (LLR, #20) I tried to give an 
sketch of the development of the anarchist movement from the second world 
war to the mid-1970s. This installment will deal with subsequent efforts 
to organize the movement. In future issues I will discuss the anarchist 
press and anarchist activism.</p>

<p><b>Organization</b></p>

<p>Organization in the anarchist movement in North America has always been 
an elusive proposition. Aside from the opposition of many anarchists to 
any type of organization above the level of the local group, collective or 
affinity group there have been the problems of organizational structure, 
of inclusiveness versus exclusiveness, of ideological unity versus 
pluralism, etc. In the post World War II era several attempts have been 
made to increase the organization and cooperation among anarchists and 
libertarian socialists. As noted in the last installment of these notes, 
in the 1950s the Libertarian League attempted to bring together 
anarchist-communists and syndicalists but was unsuccessful in breaking out 
of its New York base, aside from a scattering of contacts in places like 
Youngstown, Detroit and San Fracisco, and eventually dissolved itself in 
the mid-sixties. For a time in that decade SDS appeared to be an arena in 
which anarchist ideas were finding an echo. But as the Leninist current 
gained increasing sway in that organization anarchist ideas became 
increasingly marginalized, notwithstanding the attempts of the Radical 
Decentralization Project, led by Murray Bookchin, to create a conscious 
anarchist pole of regroupment. Those efforts were too late to forestall 
the demise of SDS which splintered into warring Marxist-Leninist sects in 
1969 leaving the anarchists with the task of beginning to forge an 
independent anarchist movement.</p>

<p>The first attempt at anarchist organization in the post- SDS era was 
the Social Revolutionary Anarchist Federation (SRAF), already discussed 
last time. But SRAF was not an organization as such but a correspondence 
network open to anyone who called themselves an anarchist. Perhaps 20 to 
30 groups over the dozen years of SRAF's existence listed themselves on 
SRAF's rolls but they were so disparate in outlook that any kind of joint 
activity was virtually impossible. Individualists cohabited with 
communists who cohabited with capitalists who cohabited with yippies - an 
unstable mixture if there ever was one. But, for all its faults, SRAF did 
provide a point of contact for the myriad of anarchist groups and 
individuals throughout North America, providing each with the sense of 
being part of a wider "movement." It certainly provided that function for 
this author. It was through SRAF that the Maine Federation of Anarchists, 
as we called out little group of troublemakers, first made contact with 
anarchists outside of out little bailiwick of Orono, Maine, and were able 
to participate in some of the debates going on in the movement in the 
early seventies. So, in that sense, SRAF was not a wasted effort; but as 
the decade of the seventies grew older anarchists and libertarian 
socialists became increasingly desirous of a more ideologically coherent 
formation.</p>

<p>In 1975 a group in Seattle issued a manifesto, "Towards an 
Anti-Authoritarian Revolutionary Movement," which they hoped would work as 
the basis for a continent-wide revolutionary anarchist organization. 
However, the leftist tone of the manifesto, and its support for national 
liberation movements, failed to attract many anarchists and the initiative 
flopped.</p>

<p>In 1976 the League for Economic Democracy, a group with roots in the 
old Socialist Labor Party in San Pedro, California, began issuing their 
newsletter, Synthesis, making known their desire to bring about closer 
collaboration among anarchists and libertarian marxists. Early issues 
contained names and addresses of the far flung anarchist and libertarian 
socialist groups and individuals, with descriptions of their varying 
perspectives and activities. Many of these groups expressed a desire for 
greater organization and unity on the libertarian left. In the end, 
however LED's initiative did not bear fruit, although Philadelphia 
Solidarity, a group also with roots in the SLP which came under the 
influence of the ideas of Paul Cardan (a.k.a. Cornelius Castoriadis) and 
the British Solidarity group, decided to merge its newsletter with 
Synthesis. LED increasingly moved in the direction of social ecology, 
eventually changing its name to League for Ecological Democracy and 
linking up with the Green movement.</p>

<p>Also in 1976 a group of anarchists and libertarian marxists in Des 
Moines, Iowa, sponsored a "Continental Organizing and Communications 
Conference" with an eye towards forming a federation of anarchist and 
libertarian socialist groups. The hosts, however, made the tactical error 
of developing an agenda and position paper to present to the conference. 
Used to gatherings at which participants more-or-less spontaneously 
developed their own agenda, anarchists strenuously objected to what they 
considered to be the host's attempts to control what went on at the 
conference. The Marxist tone of the host's perspectives also alienated 
many participants. In the end, the conference, which attracted perhaps 100 
or so participants, ended in failure.</p>

<p>However, the quest for organization went on. At the annual SRAF 
gathering, held in 1977 at Wildcat Mountain in Wisconsin, SRAF dissidents 
got together and formed the Anarchist Communist Tendency. Over the next 
several months participants in the ACT worked out a Basis of Affiliation 
and Basic Principles and in 1978 launched the Anarchist Communist 
Federation of North America.</p>

<p>Over the next three years the ACF was composed of groups in Regina, 
Sask., Toronto, Ont. (Toronto Anarchist Group), Hamilton, Ont. (Totally 
Eclipsed), Ann Arbor, MI (Nameless Anarchist Group), Chicago (Resurgence 
and Red and Black), Champaign-Urbana, IL (Resurgence and Prairie Anarchist 
League), New York City, NY (Libertarian Workers Group), Milwaukee, WI 
(Syndicalist Alliance), Evanston, IL (Mayday), Morgantown, WV (Rascal), 
Rochester, NY (Rochester Black Rose), San Francisco, CA (Bread and Roses), 
Jordan Station, Ont (Revolutionary Anarchist Group), Minneapolis, MN (Soil 
of Liberty Group), Madison, WI (No Limits Group), Ypsilanti, MI (Creative 
Urge), Portland, OR (Other Vices).</p>

<p>The principles which ACF espoused were based on the ideas of Peter 
Kropotkin and emphasized local autonomy accompanied by federal unity. The 
Federation was based on affinity groups of at least three individuals; 
individuals could not belong to the federation except as members of a 
group. This was to ensure that the federation would be a federation of 
groups and not a conglomeration of disparate individuals. Individuals who 
wished to join, however, could Participate by becoming a member-at-large 
of an existing group outside their locality until they could create their 
own local group.</p>

<p>The Federation tried to develop its politics through semiannual 
conferences where members discussed anarchist approaches to such issues as 
unionism, ecology, feminism, violence, nationalism and marxism. These 
discussions, and those that took place within the Federation's Internal 
Discussion Bulletin, were supposed to informed the practice of the local 
groups. Local groups were active in anti-nuke, feminist and labor 
struggles. The Federation's administrative functions (Internal Discussion 
Bulletin, external correspondence, treasury, etc.) were carried out by 
individual groups. As a Federation, the main activity, besides the 
semi-annual conferences, was the publication and distribution of pamphlets 
(including "Self-Management," "You Can't Blow Up a Social Relationship," 
"Anarcho-Syndicalists in the Russian Revolution") and a continental 
newspaper, the North American Anarchist.</p>

<p>The publication of the newspaper drew out some of the serious divisions 
which existed within the ACF, and within the anarchist movement as a 
whole. While all the groups that made up the ACT, and then the ACF, could 
agree on what was wrong with SRAF - the ease with which anyone who called 
themselves "anarchist" could affiliate - they did not resolve the problem. 
Although there was a process which a group had to go through before they 
could be accepted into the Federation the process did not prevent groups 
and individuals from joining who later turned out to be in fundamental 
disagreement with the basis of the organization. Disagreements over 
working within the trade unions versus building independent revolutionary 
unions, over centralism versus federalism, over "theory" versus 
"practice," pro-versus anti-technology, etc., led to increasingly 
acrimonious debates that virtually paralyzed the organization. Finally, in 
1981, the Libertarian Workers Group of New York City withdrew from the 
Federation, followed closely by Bread and Roses of San Francisco, Toronto 
Anarchist Group and Totally Eclipsed of St. Catherines, Ontario. Some of 
the groups that remained in the Federation felt a bit betrayed by these 
defections, especially when the Canadian groups took the Federation's 
newspaper with them, changing its name to Strike!. The remaining groups, 
all within the U.S. Midwest, with the exception of the group in Regina, 
Saskatchewan, tried to maintain the Federation but dissolved it within a 
year.</p>

<p>The groups that disaffiliated from ACF, except for Bread and Roses, 
which disbanded, continued to cooperate for a number of years. The 
Libertarian Workers Group and the Strike! collectives sponsored a number 
of conferences over the next few years that culminated in the formation, 
first, of the journal <i>Ideas and Action</i> in 1982 and, then, of the 
Workers Solidarity Alliance in 1984, to which the Strike! collectives did 
not adhere as they were more councilist than anarcho-syndicalist in 
orientation. WSA affiliated with the International Workers Association, 
the anarcho-syndicalist international, immediately upon its formation (LWG 
had already been affiliated with IWA). A number of anarcho-syndicalists 
within the IWW, including those of us who would become the editors of this 
journal, issued a formal letter of protest to the IWA secretariat 
challenging the right of the WSA to claim to represent anarcho-syndicalism 
in the U.S. on the grounds that most anarcho-syndicalists were active in 
the IWW and that the WSA, although claiming the anarcho-syndicalist label, 
did not intend to build revolutionary unions in the here and now, 
believing it to be impossible.</p>

<p>WSA remained a tiny formation with its main strength, such as it was, 
in New York and San Francisco, picking up individual adherents in about a 
dozen other locales. Its major workplace effort seems to have been within 
the needle trades in New York in the mid-eighties where they attempted to 
setup a Needle Trades Workers Action Committee. They also floated an 
education workers network with the inadvertent aid of the IWW. WSA never 
really developed an industrial practice of its own and many WSAers carried 
out their revolutionary unionism through the IWW. International solidarity 
campaigns seem to have been their forte, helping form the short-lived 
Libertarian Aid to Latin American Workers and its publication, No Middle 
Ground, in the mid-eighties and publishing an Eastern European Bulletin to 
report on dissident movements in the so-called Communist countries. Most 
recently WSA has been raising funds for the Nigerian anarcho-syndicalist 
Awareness League.</p>

<p><i>The Strike!</i> newspaper collective, for their part, continued to 
publish the paper and succeeded in gathering a network of support groups 
in a halfdozen, mainly Canadian, cities. It continued to focus on labor 
issues and advocate a more politically coherent anarchist organization. 
The paper, however, succumbed to lack of resources in 1986.</p>

<p>Resurgence, which was one of the major proponents of the ACF and stuck 
with it to the end, continued to be active in its local community within 
the anti-nuke and pro-choice movements, and nationally by affiliating with 
the Anarchist Association of the Americas (see below). Resurgence members 
also were very active within the IWW, helping to build the Rank and File 
Organizing Committee in an ultimately successful struggle to prevent a 
reformist clique (the Industrial Organizing Committee) from gaining 
control of the IWW's organizing resources. They were also instrumental in 
pushing for and getting the IWW to sponsor an International Libertarian 
Labor Conference in May 1986 to discuss ways to improve international 
communication and cooperation among the world's revolutionary unions. The 
conference brought together revolutionary unionists from England, France, 
South Africa, Sweden, Spain, and Poland as well as Wobblies from around 
the U.S. and Canada. In 1986 Resurgence members also participated in the 
launching of <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i>.</p>

<p><b>Regional Organizing</b></p>

<p>As ACF was self-destructing, others were initiating regional efforts to 
increase cooperation among anarchists. In New England a short-lived New 
England Anarchist Conference was organized in 1981 which brought over 150 
anarchists, active primarily in the anti-nuke and ecology movements, 
together at its founding meeting. NEAC was very much influenced by the 
social ecology of Murray Bookchin and reflected this influence in the name 
they chose for their organ, Black and Green. NEAC proposed the community 
as the main arena for revolutionary agitation in opposition to the 
workplace and rejected a revolutionary role for the working class, as a 
class. NEAC faded away in short order.</p>

<p>Another effort at regional organization was the Anarchist Association 
of the Americas. AAA began as a more-or-less local federation of anarchist 
collectives in the Washington, D.C. area around 1981 and expanded to 
include groups in Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and even as far 
way as Illinois New York and Louisiana. AAA dissolved around 1986. They 
put out a fine newsletter called Emancipation and sponsored a couple of 
regional conferences attended by a little over 100 people.</p>

<p>The break up of ACF confirmed for many anarchists their belief in the 
folly of attempting to set up any kind of national or continental 
anarchist federation, but the desire for national/continental cooperation 
still existed. Between 1986 and 1989 four continental anarchist gatherings 
were held. The first, held in Chicago in 1986, the Haymarket International 
Anarchist Gathering, was organized by Chicago Anarchists United to 
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the general strike for the 8-hour 
day. The gathering attracted some 400 anarchists from all over North 
America, as well as a few comrades from Europe. Over the four days of the 
gathering there were workshops, cultural presentations, a banquet and 
several demonstrations, one of which resulted in a few broken windows and 
38 arrests (on charges of "Mob Action Against the State").</p>

<p>While the number of participants was encouraging, the quality was not. 
There seemed to be a lack of knowledge of basic anarchist ideas and a 
surplus of unreflective "action." There were also a substantial number of 
counter-culturalists (or lifestylists) for whom adherence to vegetarianism 
or paganism was the proof of one's anarchism. There was not much interest 
in the working class or class struggle.</p>

<p>The numeric, if not political, success of the Chicago gathering led to 
others: in Minneapolis in 1987 (the Build the Movement Anarchist 
Gathering, attended by 250-300 people); in Toronto in 1988 (the Anarchist 
Survival Gathering, attended by 800); and, in San Francisco in 1989 (the 
Without Borders Anarchist Gathering, attended by more than 1,500).</p>

<p>Workshops at the gatherings reflected diverse areas of activism for the 
movement - publishing, sexism and racism, animal liberation, sabotage, 
anarcho-syndicalism, prisoner solidarity, revolutionary anarcho-communism, 
feminism and ecology. The controversies were also aired technology vs. 
anti-technology, violence vs. non-violence, anarchist participation in 
coalitions, national liberation movements, social ecology vs. deep 
ecology, paganism, and the participation of marxists at anarchist 
gatherings. Out of the gatherings a number of activist networks were 
established around prisoner support, anti-racist action, queer liberation, 
feminism, an anarchist labor network, etc.</p>

<p>There was also the obligatory "Day of Action," a chance for action 
junkies to "fuck shit up" and fight the cops. In Minneapolis it was a 
typical "War Chest Tour" to protest militarism; in Toronto the target was 
the United States Consulate following the downing of an Iranian airbus by 
U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf. At the San Francisco gathering in 
1989 two separate actions took place: one held in Berkeley, ostensibly to 
protest homelessness, turned into the usual mini-riot while the other, 
held in San Francisco's financial district, was a peaceful attempt to make 
anarchism intelligible to working people. The mini-riot got the press.</p>

<p>San Francisco, the largest of the gatherings, also turned out to be the 
last Continental gathering until the "Active Resistance" Conference held 
in Chicago in August 1996 to counter the Democratic Party's National 
Convention.</p>

<p>One outcome of the gatherings, besides showing the "diversity" of the 
movement (some would say the incoherence), was a new attempt at forging a 
continental anarchist organization. During the gathering in Minneapolis 
members of the Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League of Minneapolis, 
Heyday Anarchists of Chicago (a group that had split from Chicago 
Anarchists United after the 1986 gathering, the Revolutionary Socialist 
League (a Trotskyist group claiming to be moving towards anarchism), and 
some others, created a North American Anarchist Network, also known as the 
Mayday Network, to publish a newsletter and to develop joint projects.</p>

<p>One project was an anarchist contingent in a "Blockade the Pentagon" 
demonstration held in Washington, D.C., in October of 1988. The demo was 
sponsored by the Pledge of Resistance and the Committee in Solidarity with 
the People of El Salvador to protest U.S. intervention in Central America. 
For the occasion, the Network published a one-off newspaper entitled Rage! 
(printed by the RSL) which, among other things, advocated the use of 
mobile, disruptive tactics in the streets, and formation of Black Blocs at 
demonstrations in imitation of the European autonomen. The anarchist 
contingent numbering around 75 and joined by members of the leftist 
Progressive Student Network, utilized these tactics at the Pentagon to the 
consternation of the demonstration organizers. They also garnered some 
attention, mostly negative, from the left press, The Guardian newspaper in 
particular. Mayday also received some criticism from others in the 
anarchist movement who were wary of participating in a network with the 
RSL.</p>

<p><b>Love and Rage</b></p>

<p>The next step in the organizational process was the launching of a 
campaign to form a continental "revolutionary anarchist" newspaper 
spearheaded by the RSL. In the summer of 1989, in anticipation of the San 
Francisco Gathering, a pilot issue, entitled <i>Writing on the Wall</i>, 
was put together by folks in Chicago. At the gathering itself a workshop 
brought together people interested in the newspaper project. The project 
was viewed by its sponsors as a step on the road to building an 
organization, with local groups of newspaper supporters forming the base, 
The RSL's participation in the project led anarchists who were otherwise 
supportive of the idea of such a newspaper and organization to be 
suspicious. For these skeptics the possibility of individual 
marxist-leninist becoming anarchists was not out of the question, but a 
mass conversion as claimed by the RSL seemed highly unlikely. Suspicions 
were further aroused when the conference to actually launch the newspaper 
was held during the same weekend (November 24-25, 1989) and in the same 
venue (a church basement in Chicago) as the national conference of the RSL 
(at which the RSL formally dissolved itself). It looked to the skeptics 
like a typical Trotskyist entryist tactic.</p>

<p>At the conference itself, in which participation seemed to be by 
invitation only, over 50% of the 47 attendees were "ex"-RSL and their RABL 
and Heyday fellow travellers. Despite attempts to exclude them, members of 
the Resurgence group from Champaign, Illinois, and Some Chicago Anarchists 
(formerly Chicago Anarchists United) attended the meeting to see if the 
paper that issued from the conference would be a bonafide anarchist 
project. Over the objections of the dissidents the conference adopted a 
"Statement of Principles" which barely mentioned anarchism and its vision 
but instead regurgitated the usual laundry-list of leftist preoccupations: 
anti-racism, feminism, gay and lesbian liberation, youth movement, 
anti-imperialism, etc.; a document that was virtually indistinguishable 
from such statements in many other leftist publications, including the 
"ex"-RSL's.</p>

<p>In the months that immediately followed the foundation of <i>Love and 
Rage</i>, as the paper was called, the controversy raged in the anarchist 
press with arguments for and against appearing in <i>Fifth Estate</i> and 
<i>Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed</i>. A small group of former project 
supporters-turned-oppositionists launched a short lived paper of their own 
called <i>The Alarm</i>. The content of the <i>Love and Rage</i> did not 
convince the skeptics of the paper's anarchist credentials with its lack 
of discussion of anarchist theory, except for the occasional article 
alluding to its obsolesence. In particular, L&R's embracing of national 
liberation movements in the name of anti-imperialism, despite their 
domination by marxist-leninist and nationalist ideology, made the group's 
claims to anarchism suspect in many eyes.</p>

<p>The <i>Love and Rage</i> network attracted some support, however; 
listing some 50 groups in the paper from all over the U.S., Canada, Mexico 
and even South America. How many of these could be considered actual 
"member" groups of the Love and Rage Network is hard to say. The L&R 
Network was a loose network of autonomous anarchist groups rather than a 
unified organization, despite the wishes of its principal founders.</p>

<p>In 1993 the core groups in New York, Minneapolis and the Bay Area tried 
to remedy this situation by pushing for a tighter federative structure at 
their continental gathering held in San Diego. As a result the network 
split nearly in two, with the advocates of continuing as a loose network 
leaving (some of these groups later formed the Network of Anarchist 
Collectives). Those remaining with L&R renamed themselves the Love and 
Rage Revolutionary Anarchist Federation with affiliated groups in Oakland, 
Mexico City, Milwaukee, Detroit, East Lansing, Minneapolis, Albuquerque, 
New York City, Hamilton, Merrifield, VA, and Adamant, Vermont. L&RRAF has 
been active in the Anti-Racist Action Network, in support work for the 
Mexican Zapatistas and in struggles against cutbacks and tuition hikes at 
City University of New York. The L&RRAF leadership has also been 
increasingly critical of the anarchist tradition, indicating a possible 
move away from anarchism and back towards marxism. This posture has raised 
some dissent among some of the rank-and-file.</p>

<p>While L&R was going through these changes the rest of the anarchist 
movement was gathering, regionally that is. That same summer, 1993, three 
regional gatherings took place. In Portland, Oregon, a gathering, actually 
more of a festival, entitled "A Holiday in Beirut," brought together a 
couple hundred anarchist youth, many of them so-called Crusties 
(seldom-washed street punks) who were ready for a riot, which they got 
when police tried to break up a concert.</p>

<p>A more serious gathering was held in Philadelphia attracting several 
hundred people from the mid-Atlantic region, but also from as far away as 
Chicago and New England. There were many workshops including labor 
organizing, pirate radio, computer networking, prison/legal, anarchism and 
black revolution and sexual relationships, as well as some quite 
irrelevant topics such as job-free living, magic and nudism. A gathering 
in Madison drew around 100 folks, mainly from Minneapolis/St. Paul and 
Chicago, and featured small group discussions focusing on community 
building, organizing strategies and using technology for communication. As 
an outcome of the Philly Gathering a new network, the Atlantic Anarchist 
Circle, was formed bringing together groups from Philadelphia to New York 
and beyond.</p>

<p>In this period a number of anarchist/anti-authoritarian centers (many 
of them called info-shops in imitation of the European movement) also 
began to emerge, including Long Haul Infoshop in Berkeley, Germinal/Che 
Cafe in San Diego, A-Space in Philadelphia, Emma Community Center in 
Minneapolis, Rosebud Common in Portland, Oregon, the Right to Existence in 
Paterson, New Jersey, 404 Willis Center in Detroit (followed after its 
demise by the Trumbull Theater Complex), and the Autonomous Zone Infoshop 
in Chicago. In the summer of 1994 many of these "alternative institutions" 
gathered in Detroit and agreed to publish a networking bulletin which they 
called <i>(Dis)connection</i>.</p>

<p>At a follow-up gathering held in Antioch, Ohio, in fall of 1995 a 
Network of Anarchist Collectives was formed with <i>(Dis)connection</i> as 
its "organ," which listed some 45 collectives and infoshops in its winter 
1995 issue. The "strategy" of the NAC, if one could designate it as such, 
focused on the creation of alternative institutions as the base of an 
antiauthoritarian counter-community. NAC's main achievement so far has 
been the organization of the Active Resistance counter-convention in 
opposition to the Democratic Party Convention held in Chicago in August 
1996. The counter-convention drew around 700 participants, many of whom 
actively took part in the many demonstrations that took place during the 
convention week.</p>

<p>One other attempt at national organization should be mentioned. This 
was the formation in November 1995 at a conference in Atlanta of the 
Anti-Authoritarian Network of Community Organizers. This was an initiative 
of African-American anarchist Lorenzo Komboa Ervin and comrades from the 
Black Fist Collective from Houston in an effort to connect anarchist 
activism with the poor. The network, however, seems to have been 
still-born.</p>

<p>In addition to the above attempts at forming a more or less 
ideologically based anarchist organization there have also been numerous 
efforts at creating issue based formations, such as The Survival Network, 
Food Not Bombs, Anarchist Black Cross, Anti-Racist Action, etc. But more 
on these at a later time.</p>

<p>Attempts to organize the anarchist movement over the past 20 years or 
so have not been too successful. Networks seem to be more popular than 
Federations, as they appear to represent a compromise between group 
autonomy and the desire for greater cooperation.</p>
