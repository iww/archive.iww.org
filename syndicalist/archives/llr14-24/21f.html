<p class="blackbar">The CNT's Revolutionary Principles</p>

<p><b>Translated by Jeff Stein for <i>Libertarian Labor 
Review</i>.</b></p>

<p><i>(This is the third and last installsment of a three-part series 
about the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo, the Spanish 
anarcho-syndicalist union. It is translated from the pamphlet, 
Anarcosindicalismo, Basico. The CNT presently has about 35,000 
members.)</i></p>

<p><b>Affiliation</b></p>

<p>Anyone can voluntarily belong to the anarcho- union, with the exception 
of police, soldiers and members of security forces. No ideological 
qualification is necessary to be in the CNT. This is because the CNT is 
anarcho-syndicalist, that is, it is an organization in which decisions are 
made in assembly, from the base. It is an autonomous, federalist structure 
independent of political parties, of government agencies, of professional 
bureaucracies, etc. The anarcho-union only requires a respect for its 
rules, and from this point of view people of different opinions, 
tendencies and ideologies can live together within it. Ecologists, 
pacifists, members of political parties ... can be part of the CNT. There 
will always be different opinions, priorities and points of view about 
concrete problems. What everyone has in common within the anarcho-union is 
its unique way of functioning, its anti-authoritarian structure.</p>

<p>Revolutionary syndicalism defends itself against the maneuvers which 
would convert the union into a tool of the political parties, or 
profit-making enterprise for some individuals, or a platform for leaders, 
or a personality cult, or a rigid ideological structure. Because of this 
the CNT usually repels hierarchical or authoritarian personalities. The 
CNT is an open structure, but its members have to know where it stands and 
for what.</p>

<p><b>The Principles of Anarcho-Syndicalism</b></p>

<p>The anarcho-union is based on three fundamental principles: 
Self-Management, Federalism and Mutual Aid.</p>

<p>Self-management means self-government. The anarcho-union desires that 
individuals, workplaces, villages, cities and all other entities, manage 
their own affairs, without the interference of any authority.</p>

<p>Federalism presupposes autonomy, and is the bond which joins in free 
union all groups, as much economic as social. Federalism is the basic 
principal that prevails within the structure of the CNT, which is nothing 
but a confederation of sovereign organizations, not subject to a central 
power.</p>

<p>Mutual Aid is seen as a better system of development, in contrast to 
the competition which exists in the capitalist system. Mutual Aid sees the 
world as a whole, in spite of different races, languages and cultures.</p>

<p>In consequence, anarcho-syndicalism is anti- authoritarian, 
anti-capitalist, anti-militarist, anti- centralist, anti-theocratic, 
anti-nationalist... Or if you prefer, libertarian, communists, pacifist, 
secular, internationalist...</p>

<p><b>Direct Action: The Tactics of Anarcho-Syndicalism</b></p>

<p>The word tactic signifies action taken on the terrain of concrete 
situations. Direct action presupposes action without intermediaries, the 
direct solution of problems by the interested parties. Direct Action is a 
rejection at the same time of the activities of parliaments, magistrates, 
[bureaucratic] committees, governments, etc. in the affairs of the 
people.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>

<li>You decide one month to go on strike requesting improvements in the 
terms of employment and to stop implementation of management's production 
plan. The same strike with the same strike call can be carried forth by 
means of Direct Action, made in an assembly of all the workers and their 
delegates elected from the different departments of the workplace; or by 
Mediated Action, in which the strike is called by the [official] 
enterprise committee, which negotiates without informing nor asking the 
opinion of the assembly, and with the intervention of the [government] 
labor authorities who can dictate a settlement.</li>

<br>

<li>You have been fired. Direct Action means that your problem is taken up 
as the problem of the anarcho-union and by your fellow workers, who spread 
the word, exert pressure, job actions, sabotage, etc. in order to get your 
reinstatement. Mediated Action goes directly to a lawyer and awaits the 
action of a magistrate.</li>

</ul>

<p>The only type of action approved by the anarcho-union, is the tactic of 
Direct Action, in all its congresses since 1910.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, and to be frank, it is necessary to consider the times 
and our [meager] forces. We have to resort at times to a type of mediated 
action by way of our legal offices and the labor magistrates. We always 
prefer to solve our problems without resort to lawyers, who tend to put 
our sovereignty into the hands of the judicial system, prolonging 
processes which could be more quickly resolved without it, and spending a 
great deal of money to maintain an expensive, parasitical, pernicious and 
useless legal system.</p>

<p>But there are times in which for lack of a resolution, or support from 
the people... there remains no other remedy than to resort to a lawyer, or 
else do nothing. For this reason on occasion it has been proposed to 
accept into the accords of congresses, the use of direct action 
preferably, but mediated action when other remedies don't exist. It has 
not been done, because as long as Direct Action is held to be the only 
tactic acceptable to anarcho-syndicalist militants, we will maintain a 
commitment to it, and every time that we act contrary to Direct Action, we 
are aware that we are breaking an accord. If we admit a type of tactics 
against our structure and we swallow the indigestible, it is possible that 
when we have enough strength and enough people to carry out our point of 
view without supporting legal norms, we will not be able to see it and 
will routinely appeal to the tribunals. [It might make more sense to adopt 
a clearly defined and more consistent policy on when legal means may be 
used, and set some limits, than to officially denounce such tactics but 
pretend not to notice that the union is using them. - Translator's 
note]</p>

<p>Direct Action is always quicker, cheaper and more effective than 
recourse to mediation. It has the disadvantage of requiring more energy 
and courage to carry out.</p>

<p><b>The Final Goal of Anarcho-Syndicalism</b></p>

<p>Anarcho-syndicalism wants to transform society. It wants to abolish the 
capitalist system and the state. It believes that no one has the right to 
impose their will on others in order to rob and exploit their labor, and 
to maintain this system supported by an apparatus of organized violence 
and terror which is the state and its police system. There exists a large 
quantity of literature dedicated to a critique of the capitalist system, 
and we are not going to dwell much on this theme.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at this transformation, the anarcho-union affirms 
that there exists no other means than the Social Revolution, an abrupt 
change by which the authoritarian structures are demolished. It is the end 
of a process and the beginning of something new. The revolution occurs 
when the people collectively see it as necessary, when the moral, ethical, 
philosophical and economic basis of the system is seen as bankrupt. It is 
not a predictable phenomenon, nor realized by a minority, but you prepare 
for it, then there comes a moment when it is possible, something breaks 
loose, and it happens. The role of the anarcho-union is to build upon the 
contradictions of the system, to make clear to the people the falsehood, 
the deception, the exploitation committed by a ruling minority, and to be 
present during the revolutionary process to incite it if possible, and to 
avoid on the side of the revolution the self-seeking benefit of 
minorities, vanguards, parties, etc., and on the other, when the 
counter-revolution comes, that the people lose as little as possible of 
what they gained. The revolution must abolish property, the state, 
governments, police, the army, universities, churches, banks, industries, 
the competitive and individualist mentality... and establish new 
structures and forms of life.</p>

<p>The revolution is thought, liberty and desire in action. People who 
have lived through revolutionary times describe them as a festival of 
lights, sounds and joy. It is not a bath of blood and violence such as 
they show on television. The people stop in the street and talk, this 
happens always and is very important. They talk about everything, they 
talk with people of other languages and they understand them because they 
want to communicate with you. They talk about things that nobody before 
had ever said and that now comes out naturally, without effort. They 
accomplish things which days before would have been inconceivable... 
Whoever has seen such moments on any occasion will never forget them.</p>

<p>The revolutionary act is an act of the people. It is realized by the 
existing people with all their defects. There has been a debate over the 
centuries whether the revolution could be brought about through normal 
beings, who are more or less as forceful, authoritarian, violent as is 
this sick society, or by people who are better formed and who carry within 
them the form of future behavior and have been changed by education and 
other methods. In general, although there are as many opinions in the 
anarcho-union as there are persons, the CNT holds the opinion that the 
revolution will be realized by the people as they are today, and that the 
way to form persons in liberty and responsibility is first to have a 
social transformation. That is to say that it is first necessary to change 
the social structure and the people will change afterward. It likewise 
happens that the revolution purifies people, at least until the time in 
which the counter-revolution comes, and the longer the revolution lasts, 
the better they become.</p>

<p>In spite of this idea, the anarcho-union makes an effort to turn the 
union into a school of the people, transmitting through it by means of 
constant debate with other schools of thought, and foreshadowing the 
future society by creating here and now, a structure similar to that which 
we hope to substitute to authoritarian society, a new moral and ethical 
way of life.</p>

<p>The capitalist state has taken on the responsibility over the decades, 
with the valued aid of the establishment unions and political parties, of 
inculcating us with the idea that revolution doesn't bring anything more 
than disasters, and that in our developed western civilizations, democracy 
is the only viable invention. The CNT is certain that the social 
revolution is the only worthwhile, sincere and realistic future for the 
human species, that the revolution is not the bloodbath depicted in films 
and history books. The revolution must be treated as a process that is 
gestating now, that will arrive, as it always arrives, and we should be 
prepared to meet it without fear, and add fuel to the blaze. Whether it 
will be provoked by a strike, by a military coup, by a crash in the stock 
market, by the refusal to pay taxes, by a capitalist war, by factory 
occupations, by an invasion of immigrants, is something that we can't 
know. That which is certain is that a large CNT, merged with the people, 
will be the revolution's best guarantee of triumph, and that what has 
happened in previous attempts, in which the state has reasserted itself 
and the same conditions in a different guise, does not happen again.</p>

<p>The structure that society will take once the revolution is carried 
out, is that which the confederation calls, Communismo Libertario 
[Libertarian Communism], an economic system in which each person will take 
from society what they need, and will give in exchange what they are 
able.</p>

<p>The CNT and the Spanish people had the opportunity of developing the 
most profound and beautiful revolution in human history, during the period 
of social war from 1936 to 1939. They put into practice the ideas which 
have been expressed above, and demonstrated that a free life and equality 
doesn't depend on anything more than free will. For capitalism it was 
necessary to wage a war of extermination, in order to destroy Utopia for 
the moment.</p>

<p><b>Voting in the Anarcho-Union</b></p>

<p>In the CNT voting is avoided and agreements are reached by consensus. 
Unfortunately when there are large numbers of people involved in the 
discussion it is more difficult to reach agreement and there comes a time 
when it is necessary to take a vote.</p>

<p>In local union assemblies this problem is resolved with ease. Normally 
votes are not taken because people within the union know each other 
directly and from their daily contact they are accustomed to having more 
or less the same ideas, and if it becomes necessary to vote by the number 
of those agreeing, each one gets a vote.</p>

<p>The problem arises when decisions have to be made in local or regional 
plenaries or congresses. It is already been explained that the basic 
structure of the CNT is the industrial union branch, or where these do not 
exist, the union of various occupations [SOV - Sindicato de Oficios 
Varios]. Well then, there is no completely fair method for making 
decisions through voting.</p>

<ul>

<li>If each union gets one vote, a union of 1,000 members would have the 
same voice in decisions as a union of 50. Two unions of 25 (2 votes) could 
impose their opinion onto a union of 1,000 (1 vote).</li>

<li>If votes are by the number of members, a union of 2,000 members would 
have 2,000 votes, and 100 unions of 20 members would have the same voice 
in decisions as just one union. The geographical distribution of 100 
unions is wider than that of just one, but an agreement obligates all 
unions equally even though a small union would have the same 
responsibility to enforce it as a big union, in spite of the greater 
difficulty for the small one.</li>

<li>We find besides the problem of minorities. For example, union A 
decides to go on strike by 400 votes against 350, and would have to 
support its decision to strike, since that was the outcome of its 
assembly. Union B of the same local federation says no to the strike by 
100 votes to 25. Union C of the local federation says yes by a unanimous 
15 votes. There are thus two unions in favor of the strike and one 
against, so a strike would be called if based on one vote per union. But 
adding the negative votes together, 450 voted against the strike, leaving 
440 in favor. In order to avoid these possible inequalities in the 
anarcho-union, when a vote is needed a proportional system is called upon, 
which bases the decision on the number of people voting one way or the 
other according to the following table:</li>

	<br><ul>From 1 to 50 adherents - 1 vote
	<br>From 51 to 100 - 2 votes
	<br>From 101 to 300 - 3 votes
	<br>From 301 to 600 - 4 votes
	<br>From 601 to 1000 - 5 votes
	<br>From 1001 to 1500 - 6 votes
	<br>From 1501 to 2500 - 7 votes
	<br>From 2501 and beyond - 8 votes</ul></ul>

<p>This system benefits minorities, but its results may be disputable. For 
example, ten unions with 25 adherents would total 250 members having 10 
votes. This would be more votes than a union of 2,500, which with 10 times 
more members, would only have the right to 7 votes. As you can see it is a 
mess. [Although perhaps no more so than in a representative body like the 
U.S. Congress in which tiny states like Rhode Island have proportionally 
more representation per citizen than populous states like California. - 
translator's note]</p>

<p>The reason the CNT does not look for another system is because in the 
present day it is not necessary. The agreements consented to after 
discussions can seem absurd to those who started with something else in 
mind in the anarcho-union, but they are extremely important for the union 
or region which defends their position. What one thinks about the outcome 
of all forms depends on your frame of reference.</p>

<p>Whenever there is voting, one has to recognize that what is being 
discussed is a problem of power, and in the anarcho-union therefore one 
must try to vote as little as possible, and reach agreement by consensus. 
All our votes are open, and with raised hands. They are never secret.</p>

<p><b>Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism</b></p>

<p>The CNT is not an anarchist organization. This is something which must 
be made clear. The CNT is an anarcho-syndicalist union. Although there are 
many similarities between both things, there are also differences.</p>

<p>Anarchism is by definition illegal, a negation of the state which 
cannot give it permission to live. Anarcho-syndicalism moves within 
legality: it legalizes its union sections and federations in order to 
function more easily. Anarcho-syndicalism operates inside of major 
contradictions.</p>

<p>The base of anarchism is the affinity group, a group of close friends, 
without regard to jobs, or geographic location. The base of 
anarcho-syndicalism is the [local] union of various occupations or the 
industrial union branch.</p>

<p>Anarchist action is theoretically more revolutionary than that of the 
anarcho-syndicalist. Anarcho- syndicalism struggles for immediate demands, 
a reformist activity, even if it is outside [capitalist] institutions and 
based upon its own forces.</p>

<p>Anarcho-syndicalism permits the coexistence within it of people of 
various ideologies: marxists, christians, anarchists... it only requires 
that they be workers. Anarchist organizations are necessarily formed only 
of anarchists.</p>

<p>Anarchism functions more on the ideological level, in education, 
propaganda, information, cultural activity, as well as within 
anarcho-syndicalist unions... The union acts above all within the places 
of work.</p>

<p>Anarchism is more than an idea. Anarcho- syndicalism is more than a 
structure. Anarchists are supposed to be better persons than the social 
average, with better ethics and less egocentrism. Anarcho-syndical-ism 
expects nothing more from its members than that they are workers and 
respect its structure.</p>

<p>Anarchism does not direct anarcho-syndicalism. For the latter it is 
more than enough to push forward its own projects. Besides, in Spain it 
has been anarcho- syndicalism which on more than one occasion has carried 
along, directed and employed for different purposes the anarchist 
organizations which supported it.</p>

<p>There exist good relations, fraternal, between the CNT and the 
different libertarian organizations on a national scale, which are in 
Spain, the FAI [Spanish Anarchist Federation], the FIJL [Spanish Anarchist 
Youth Federation], and Mujeres Libres [Anarchist Women's organization], as 
well as with clubs, groups and individual anarchists. The vast majority of 
anarchists work within the CNT, and their organizations generally help the 
anarcho-union without conditions.</p>

<p class="redbar">Translator's Comments</p>

<p>The three parts of this series were excerpted from a longer pamphlet. I 
dropped the historical quotations which accompanied the original to 
concentrate on the contemporary material as well as to save space and 
translation time. I also did not include the material concerning CNT 
positions on various bargaining topics like salaries, hours, redundancies, 
etc., as well as social issues like militarism, ecology, gay rights, etc. 
This material would have added little to the text since CNT positions on 
these issues do not differ from standard left-wing socialist and labor 
positions. What is unique about the CNT, and separates it from other 
Spanish unions, is its anarcho-syndicalist structure and practice.</p>

<p>What is important about this look into the CNT is it shows the 
similarity between the CNT and the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World). 
Although the IWW is not officially an anarcho-syndicalist union, it 
functions in much the same way. Like the CNT, the IWW emphasizes building 
worker-run industrial union branches at the point of production. In 
geographical areas where this is not immediately possible, the IWW allows 
its members to organize into General Membership Branches, similar to the 
SOVs (Sindicatos de Officios Varios) of the CNT. Like the CNT, the IWW 
maintains that direct action is the most effective form of worker 
resistance to employers, but also like the CNT the IWW is ready to use 
whatever legal recourse it can to protect its members when direct action 
is not possible.</p>

<p>There are differences between the CNT and the IWW, of course. Unlike 
the CNT, the IWW is not federalist. The branches and industrial unions of 
the IWW are self-governing, but the IWW has a mass elected General 
Executive Board with policy-making powers, although the Executive Board's 
actions can be overridden by member referendum. The IWW also gives its 
members an appeal process whereby union disciplinary actions or 
constitutional violations by local unions can be overturned by higher 
bodies. These elected central bodies and powers give individual members in 
the IWW more protection from arbitrary actions by local unions than in the 
CNT, but it is at the expense of diminishing local authority. Neither the 
CNT's federalism nor the IWW's elected representation is a perfect system, 
and both depend on their membership's vigilance and common sense to see 
that their system is not abused.</p>

<p>The CNT may have some lessons for the IWW. In the coming months, the 
financial crisis within the IWW may force it to reevaluate the way it is 
structured. Maintaining a central office with a paid General Secretary 
Treasurer and paid office helper may no longer be affordable. If the IWW 
can't straighten out its finances, a shutdown of its central office or a 
shift to an all- volunteer staff might be necessary. If this happens how 
will the IWW function as a centralized organization? Can its General 
Executive Board direct a non-existent or part-time General Headquarters? 
Perhaps adopting a more federalist structure with a General Secretariat 
composed of volunteers from the same or nearby General Membership Branches 
could be a solution. What this would mean for IWW members living in areas 
where there are not enough Wobblies to form a branch, is unclear. Would 
these individuals be forgotten by a decentralized IWW? Would a Secretariat 
based upon a single branch or region, serve the whole union's interest or 
just a local one? If the CNT is to be used as a model, we need to look at 
both its faults as well as its benefits.</p>

<p>In a forth coming issue, I would like to see a study of the SAC, the 
Swedish syndicalist union. The SAC may have its own answers to how to 
maintain a labor organization with workers' control. Stay tuned.</p>
