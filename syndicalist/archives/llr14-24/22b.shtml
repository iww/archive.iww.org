<p class="blackbar">Cops Raid Anarchist Centers Across Italy</p>

<p>On the night of June 19, 1997, Italian security forces carried out 
raids on anarchist centers and private homes all over Italy. The pretext 
for the raids was a bombing that took place at the Palazzo Marrino in 
Milan on April 25,1997. The authorities claimed that an anarchist group 
took responsibility for the bombing; but, as the Italian Anarchist 
Federation pointed out in a press release issued June 25, the bombing 
could just as easily have been the work of fascists. Indeed, several 
bombings in the 1970s and '80s which were originally laid at the door of 
the anarchists later turned out to be the work of fascists carrying out 
their "Strategy of Tension" to provoke governmental repression.</p>

<p>The centers and homes raided by the police in their fishing expedition, 
however, were of anarchists whose public political positions and social 
practice tend towards the rank-and-file labor movement and whose 
libertarian practice has nothing to do with the logic of such spectacular 
actions as bombing. For this reason the Italian Anarchist Federation, 
through a communication issued by its Correspondence Commission, has 
denounced the raids as having nothing really to do with the investigation 
of this bombing but rather as a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate the 
anarchist movement.</p>

<p>These raids are coming at a time when the center-left government is 
increasing attacks on workers' rights and the social wage (health care, 
education, transport) and promoting militarism and "humanitarian" 
intervention (e.g., Somalia, Albania). It is no coincidence, according to 
the FAI, that among the materials confiscated in the raids anti-militarist 
and anti-conscription propaganda figured prominently, and that while these 
raids were taking place anarchist draft resister Michele Pircher was taken 
into custody.</p>

<p>They also come on the heels of raids and arrests carried out in 
September 1996 against anarchists in a government attempt to create public 
hysteria about an alleged secret anarchist paramilitary "organization" 
which is being held responsible for numerous bank robberies, kidnapping 
and murders over the past ten years. To justify this assault on the 
anarchist movement the authorities have made up a fantastic anarchist 
"organization," called by the authorities Armed Insurrectionist Anarchist 
Organization though no documents or manifestoes bearing that name have 
been produced. Supposedly this alleged organization exists on two levels: 
an underground army of terrorists protected by an above-ground milieu of 
squatted social centers and social movements.</p>

<p>The main "witness" for the existence of this gang is the testimony of a 
21-year-old ex-girlfriend of one of the accused who, though never an 
anarchist, claims to have taken part in a bank robbery with three 
anarchists in Trento in 1994, although she could not remember any 
details.The authorities are also relying on surveillance that the 
powersthat-be have been conducting on the anarchist movement since 1976 
and on the writings of Al f redo M. Bonanno, whom they have crowned the 
"Anarchist Godfather" for his insurrectionist politics. The structure of 
this organization was supposedly set up in a series of 
anarchist-insurrectionist conferences held in Greece in 1993.</p>

<p>At least 29 arrest warrants were issued and at least 39 people were 
informed that they were under official investigation. Of these some were 
already in jail: Antonio Budini, Carlo Tesseri, jean Weir and Christos 
Stratigopolus since September 1994 for a bank robbery near Trento; Orlando 
Campo, Gregorian Gargarin, Francesco Porcu for the Silocchi kidnapping; 
Horst Fantazzini (since 25 years) for many robberies and assault; and 
Marco Camenisch for bombings. In all it looks like some 68 people have 
been implicated by the police in this supposed "terrorist" gang. 21 
anarchists were apprehended between Sept. 17, 1996, and the end of 
December, while 8 went underground. On December 18 two of those arrested 
were sentenced to 22 years in prison.</p>

<p>Also arrested in relation to the Milan bombing was Patrizia Cadeddu, 
one of the occupants of the Laboratorio Anarchico di Milano, arrested on 
20 June for being the alleged deliverer of a supposed note claiming 
responsibility for the bombing by a group called Azione Rivluzionaria 
Anarchica (Anarchist Revolutionary Action). In September Cadeddu was 
transferred to Rome to be interrogated, supposedly by Marini, as part of 
the investigation of subversive associations.</p>

<p>On July 17, 1997, the judge presiding over the preliminary inquiry of 
the Roman Tribunal, Claudia D'Angelo, read the following sentence: "Let us 
remind you that all of the defendants were accused of: subversive 
association (art. 270 of the criminal code); subversive association 
leading to terrorism and the destruction of democratic order (art. 270); 
formation of and participation in an armed band (art. 360). In addition, 
all are charged with receiving stolen goods (art. 648).</p>

<p>... Anna Beniamino, Mario Frisetty, Maria Ludovica Maschietto, Alfredo 
Cospito, Nadia DePascal, Raffaele Scapuzzo, Carmela Antonia Scopetta, 
Giuseppe Scarso, Bruno Palamara, Roberto Sforza, Pierleone Porcu, 
Constantino Cavelleri, Anna Maria Sgarmella, Mario Anzoino, Maria Arenale, 
will be tried for participation in a subversive organization aiming to 
violently overthrow the economic and social order of the state (art. 
270)." The judge has exonerated them of being in a armed band and of 
receiving stolen goods.</p>

<p>Loris Fantazzini, Pasquale Lorenti, Flavia Cannoletta, Roberto 
Gemignani, Marco Brizzolari, Maracino Domenico, Corrado Viola, Edoardo 
Massari, Giovanni Mario Sann and Bachisio Goddi are exonerated of all 
accusations.</p>

<p>Alfredo Maria Bonanno, Tiziano Andreozzi, Francesco Berlemmi, Antonio 
Budini, Marco Camenisch, Orlando Camp, Maria Apollonaria Cortimiglia, 
Luciano DiFazio, Liborio Falco, Horst Fantazzini, Antonio Gizzo, Franco 
Fonte, Gagarin Gregorian, Salvatore Gugliara, Christina La Forte, Angela 
Maria Lo Vecchio ' Guido Mantelli, Maria Marotta, Giuseppe Martino, 
Stefano Moreale, Mojdeh Namsetchi, Roberta Nano, Bruno Palamara, Fabrizio 
Pio, Francesco Porcu, Lorenzo Ricca, Giuseppina Roccobobo, Paolo Ruberto, 
Emma Sassosi, Rose Ann Scrocco, Antonio Sforza, Fabio Sforza, Massimo 
Sforza, Giuseppi Stasi, Christos Stratigopulos, Carlo Tesseri, Evangelia 
Tsioutzia, and jean Helen Weir will be tried for participation in a 
subversive organization aiming to violently overthrow the economic and 
social order of the state (art. 270), subversive association leading to 
terrorism and the destruction of democratic order (art. 270), formation of 
an participation in an armed band (art. 360) and receiving stolen goods 
(art. 648).</p>

<p>These defendants will also be tried on various individual charges 
against them."</p>

<p>The trials were to begin October 20,1997. As of this writing we have 
seen nothing new on the case accept that, interestingly enough, Alfredo 
Bonanno and Emma Sassosi were released on provisional liberty on October 
31, after 13 months in jail awaiting trial. Other defendants who were 
already in jail under other sentences remain behind bars.</p>

<p>Judging from the charges the Marini operation is a clear attempt to 
criminalize the anarchist movement in Italy. Our Italian comrades, 
however, refuse, to be intimidated and vow to carry on with their 
activity.</p>
