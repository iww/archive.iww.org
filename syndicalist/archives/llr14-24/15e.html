<p class="blackbar">Reforming the Teamsters</p>

<p><b>by Jon Bekken</b></p>

<p>Ron Carey began his five-year term as president of the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters Feb. 1, 1992. Carey and his reform slate - 
heavily backed by Teamsters for a Democratic Union (most of Carey's slate, 
though not Carey himself, were TDU members) - swept the elections, in a 
three-way race in which barely a fourth of the Teamsters' 1.5 million 
members voted - half of them for Carey. The election capped a 17-year 
struggle to reform the Teamsters, but was made possible only after the 
government put the union under federal trusteeship (in March 1989) under 
U.S. racketeering laws. The effort to reform the Teamsters union has been 
taken as an example by many other union activists who find themselves in 
corrupt or undemocratic business unions - indeed the foremost advocate of 
this union reform movement, Labor Notes, is firmly aligned with TDU. The 
Carey/TDU experience is thus important not only for what it means to 
members of the Teamsters union, but also as an example of where efforts to 
reform the business unions are likely to take us.</p>

<p>Although the Teamsters began as a union for drivers of horse- drawn 
wagons, today they organize anybody they can get dues from - truck 
drivers, warehouse workers, grocery store clerks, flight attendants, state 
employees, etc. The Teamsters' International (U.S. and Canada) Executive 
Board can place local affiliates in receivership for corruption or 
mismanagement, but otherwise has little authority over Teamster locals. 
Locals pay $3.90 a month to the International, the bulk of members' dues 
stay with locals or with powerful regional boards. About a fifth of IBT 
members are covered by national contracts, mostly United Parcel Service 
workers. Teamster benefit plans and grievance boards are controlled by 
regional Teamsters conferences, most of which remain solidly in the grip 
of old-guard officers backed by entrenched local union bosses. Regional 
(conference) officers are elected by local union officers, not by the 
membership - just as national officers were before the government 
take-over.</p>

<p><b>A Nest of Thieves</b></p>

<p>That the Teamsters was thoroughly corrupt is a truism so well- known 
that it hardly needs repeating. Three of the most recent six previous 
presidents went to jail, a fourth died while under indictment for 
embezzelement, and a fifth led the mob drain the union's pension funds. 
Carey's predecessor (who has thus far not been indicted for any crime) 
rigged contract procedures to give his son-in-law the union's printing 
work. But in recent years mob control of the Teamsters had weakened - 
whether as a result of repeated prosecutions of mob-affiliated Teamster 
leaders or because the weakened union (since deregulation the Teamsters no 
longer control interstate trucking) and its looted pension plan were no 
longer as attractive as other rackets.</p>

<p>And the extent to which the union is being cleaned up is easily 
over-stated. To Carey's credit, he has dumped the jets and limousines that 
symbolized the lavish lifestyle of his predecessors, and also dumped many 
double- and triple-dipping Teamster officials from the headquarters 
payroll. (These hardworking piecards simultaneously held down two or more 
full-time jobs with the Teamsters on the local, regional and national 
level; when Carey dumped them from the headquarters payroll they were 
forced to fall back on their second jobs, from which they have become 
bitter opponents of the Carey regime.) Carey replaced the double-dippers 
and other opponents with labor activists who support his policies.</p>

<p>In many ways the Teamsters are just as corrupt as ever. Outright 
control by the mob is, by and large, passe - especially as this sort of 
corruption invites critical attention from the government trustees still 
overseeing the Teamsters. Long-entrenched mob regimes have been ousted 
from several locals, and other Teamster officers have been ousted for 
using union treasuries as their personal checking accounts - among them 
New York Teamster boss Barry Feinstein. (Interestingly, the New York Times 
and other union officers were unstinting in praising Feinstein as a labor 
statesman as he was being forced from office.)</p>

<p>But government-run locals have not shown themselves to be notably 
committed to improving wages or working conditions, or to conserving the 
members' dues for legitimate union purposes. Instead the government is 
systematically looting the Teamsters and making the union even more 
subservient to employers than it was under mob control.</p>

<p>Under the consent decree which old guard Teamsters officials signed to 
keep themselves out of jail, a three-person Independent Review Board is 
supposed to investigate corruption charges and recommend appropriate 
action to the appropriate local, regional and/or "international" union 
bodies. If the Board isn't satisfied with their action, it has the right 
to conduct its own hearings and take whatever action it chooses, subject 
only to appeal to the courts. One board member was appointed by the 
Teamsters, a second, former judge Frederick Lacey, by the government. The 
two were supposed to select a third by mutual agreement, but when they 
couldn't immediately agree the government appointed former CIA and FBI 
director William Webster to the "neutral" seat - a finer exemplar of dirty 
tricks and corruption would not be easy to find. Webster sits on the Board 
of Anheuser-Busch (as well as the Pinkerton Agency) and thus is 
indisputably a member of the employing class. Worse still, he is not only 
an employer - he is an employer of Teamsters! So the government has given 
the bosses the swing vote in deciding "union" policy.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, the government refused the Teamsters' very 
reasonable request to limit the amount of money Lacey could soak their 
treasury for. Having witnessed Lacey's high-spending ways in the two years 
Lacey oversaw the union as federal trustee, Carey was reluctant to give 
him a blank check. Lacey charges the union $385 an hour (about $775,000 a 
year, if he works a 40-hour week); Carey, by contrast, makes "only" 
$175,000 (after he cut the salary by $50,000). Carey asked that Lacey be 
limited to no more than $50,000 a year in fees, but Lacey demanded and got 
a minimum fee of $100,000 plus expenses with no upper limit. Even the 
highest-paid Teamster bosses never soaked the working members for that 
much.</p>

<p>Some union reformers (most notably the Association for Union Democracy) 
have defended the Independent Review Board as necessary to ensure that 
local and regional officers do not abuse members' rights, though 
criticizing its cost and the Webster appointment. But having government 
officials determine union policy, settle union grievances, determine who 
will hold union office and dictate union rules is corruption of the worst 
sort. At least the members have somewhat of a chance (however slim) 
fighting against mobsters and bureaucrats; with the government running 
their union they are left powerless when the bosses attack.</p> 
    
<p>While Carey has vigorously denounced this government interference, his 
record of opposing corruption is unimpressive. In one of his last actions 
in his guise as federal trustee, Lacey vetoed Carey's attempt to appoint 
one Ronald Miller as international union representative on the grounds 
that the "appointment would further a racketeering activity - the 
extortion of the rank and file's right to a democratic union." Despite 
Carey's reputation as a union reformer, it seems that he is willing to 
turn a blind eye to harassment of union dissidents when those doing the 
harassing are his supporters.</p>

<p>Teamster Local 30, in Pennsylvania, is home to newly elected (on the 
Carey slate) Teamster General Secretary-Treasurer Tom Sever, Miller (local 
business agent), and Tom Felice, a persistent critic of the Sever 
administration. When Felice was laid off from his job, he had to find 
another job in its jurisdiction in order to maintain his membership. He 
found a job but Local 30 officers would not sign the necessary paperwork, 
so Felice lost the job and was forced out of the local. When he sued, the 
federal judge hearing the case ruled that Sever and Miller "without 
doubt... acted in bad faith" and forced him from the union through 
"despicable" "bullying tactics." Lacey decided that violating 
rank-and-file rights violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act (under which the government took control of the 
Teamsters).</p>

<p>This decision is interesting on at least two counts - on the one hand 
it nicely illustrates Carey's disregard for the democratic rights of 
rank-and-file Teamsters; on the other, it marks a dramatic extention of 
government power. Under the logic of this ruling, any union dissident 
whose civil liberties were violated in their unions could turn to federal 
prosecutors and ask them to bring criminal or civil charges. But at the 
same time, the logic is easily extended to allow prosecution of union 
officers and seizure of unions for virtually any violation of government 
policy - say, refusal to handle non-union goods or honoring a picket line 
(indeed there is far more precedent for such an interpretation of RICO 
than to support Lacey's innovative reading of the law).</p>

<p><b>A Model Piecard</b></p>

<p>Carey himself is the very model of the piecard. He has been a full-time 
union bureaucrat since 1967, representing United Parcel workers in Long 
Island. (Though in fairness, Carey got his start in the Teamsters as a UPS 
driver, unlike that other darling of the union reform crowd, Rich Trumka, 
who put in only a few months in the mines working a summer job before 
going on the UMW payroll as a staff attorney.) By all accounts, Carey 
proved an effective union president, and he got 97.5 percent of his 
local's vote for IBT president.</p>

<p>Since taking control of the Teamsters international, Carey has 
generally argued for a more militant posture - threatening strikes and 
boycotts in situations where his predecessors might have called for 
cooperation or concessions. The new administration has promised programs 
to educate local officials on labor-management cooperation schemes, a 
major organizing drive, and concerted efforts to involve rank-and-file 
members in the ongoing fight for a new contract from United Parcel Service 
(last time around, the Teamsters granted major concessions).</p>

<p>The catch is the word "promised." Teamster watchers report that the UPS 
effort has been sidelined by attempts to work through often-hostile local 
officers, and that very little actual mobilizing work has been done. And 
the Carey administration is handicapped by a major financial crisis. The 
old guard spent millions of dollars on court battles to keep themselves 
out of jail and in office, and millions more on high salaries and lavish 
perks. They took $34 million out of the strike fund to cover these 
deficits. Although Carey has cut spending on officers, legal fees and 
perks, many of his programs will cost money - and a UPS strike would 
exhaust the depleted strike fund in only two weeks.</p>

<p>Carey has also pressed for a more powerful International union 
structure. Where the Teamsters have always been a decentralized federation 
of largely autonomous locals, Carey's vision calls for a centralized 
structure with a powerful president (himself). Carey's General Executive 
Board has unilaterally amended the Teamsters' constitution to give the 
president the power to appoint the chairperson and other members of the 
grievance panels that administer the Teamsters' national contracts. The 
Teamsters constitution apparently gives the Executive Board the authority 
to amend any section of the constitution dealing with contract bargaining, 
ratification and enforcement on its own authority, without a vote by the 
membership, although some Teamster officials have challenged this 
interpretation. Jack Yager, for example, who chaird the policy committee 
of the Teamsters Central Conference, has declared that he will continue to 
appoint grievance chairs in the conference and would simply ignore Carey's 
attempts to assert his power in this area. In response, Carey filed 
internal union charges against Yager April 23 seeking his removal from 
office. Carey charged Yager with signing sweetheart deals with Flint 
Special Services and Wintz Parcel, undermining efforts to "reform" the 
grievance procedure, and charging unauthorized Central Conference 
assessments on local unions. Yager has denounced the proceedings as an 
attempt to silence critics of the new regime.</p>

<p>Clearly the old guard officers and their appointees have done little if 
anything to defend members' rights through the grievance process (though 
in part this may be due to problems inherent in trying to resolve these 
issues through regional and national panels far removed from the actual 
grievances, rather than on the shop floor through direct action). But at 
the same time, Carey's effort to pack these panels with his own loyalists 
is unlikely to do much to empower the rank-and-file. It will, however, 
greatly strengthen the powers of the central bureaucracy over the lives of 
working Teamsters - and there may well come a time when rank-and-filers 
will learn to regret that power (whether exercised by Carey or his 
successors).</p>

<p><b>Teamsters for a Democratic Union</b></p>

<p>Ten of Carey's 14 slate members were TDU members, and TDU handled most 
of the get-out-the-vote activities. Carey's entire slate was elected, and 
so TDU now ostensibly controls the Teamsters' executive board. Those TDU 
activists find themselves in an awkward position - to the extent that they 
carry out their reform agenda, they must encourage the rank-and-file to be 
more active and to challenge old guard Teamsters officials. Indeed, TDU is 
organizing election challenges against several local officers (with mixed 
results). They are also pressing for changes in local union bylaws in an 
attempt to ensure fairer election procedures.</p>

<p>This, of course, has the effect of further polarizing Carey's relations 
with local and regional officials who control the union's pension funds, 
grievance panels, and most of its contracts. Joint Council 53, for 
example, recently passed a resolution calling TDU "a cancer eating away at 
the teamsters' union" and demanding that Carey keep his officers away from 
locals in its jurisdiction. If Carey and TDU are to revitalize the 
Teamsters from above, they need the cooperation of those officials - at 
the very least they need them to stand aside. On the other hand, if they 
wish to redirect the Teamsters over the long haul, they need to replace 
old guard officials at all levels. So Carey's administration has moved 
slowly, trying to woo over as many old guard officials as possible. 
Although Carey replaced virtually the entire UPS grievance panel, for 
example, he left the freight grievance panel largely intact.</p>

<p>Some Teamsters have protested the retention of "business as usual" 
officials who have failed to enforce basic contract provisions for years. 
But you will be hard-pressed to find such concerns expressed in the TDU 
newspaper, Convoy-Dispatch. TDU's paper attacks the "half-truths, 
distortions and outright lies about our International leadership," 
supports efforts to raise Teamsters dues (or at least the proportion going 
to the International), backs efforts to shift power from locals and 
regions (in the hands of their enemies) to the International (in their 
hands, at least for the next few years), and praises "this great union of 
ours."</p>

<p>TDU's sudden switch from rank-and-filism to operating as the 
administration caucus in union politics was predictable. Despite efforts 
in TDU literature to portray itself as a spontaneous response to a series 
of sell-outs by a mob-ridden union bureaucracy, TDU represented a 
continuation of efforts by Trotskyists to bore from within the Teamsters 
union and capture it for their leadership. Members of International 
Socialists were among the many leftists who sought out jobs in unionized 
heavy industry in the late 1960s and 1970s as part of a strategy to 
implant their ideas among the workers. IS ultimately adopted a strategy of 
deep entryism in which their "socialism" became all- but-invisible as they 
focussed instead on gaining influence by organizing around short-term 
reforms.</p>

<p>These borers benefitted from an upsurge of unrest in the Teamsters: 
steel haulers were demanding their own union, nearly 50,000 wildcat 
strikers demanded better contracts, and Ralph Nader's Professional Drivers 
Council (PROD) was pressing the Teamsters to take on health and safety 
issues - and soon expanded its focus to corruption and union democracy. 
With its supporters spread across the country, a dedicated core of 
activists used to spending long hours on organizational activities and the 
ability to draw upon IS resources to help get their efforts off the 
ground, IS members were in a strong position to take charge of this effort 
and reshape it in their own direction. They began with a single-issue 
campaign around the 1976 freight contract - and with about three dozen 
Teamsters (by no means all of them ISers) in 14 cities. But they 
distributed tens of thousands of leaflets and struck a cord among 
Teamsters determined to halt their eroding wages and working conditions. 
TDU was formally organized in the aftermath of this campaign, at a 
September 1976 meeting in Kent, Ohio. To quote from TDU's account of the 
founding convention's approach:</p>

    <blockquote>They rejected the strategy of "dual unionism" or
    secession from the Teamsters whioch some other reform
    groups had avocated... They decided that TDU was not
    going to confine its activities to the truck drivers and
    dock workers in the freight industry... Finally, the men
    and women who founded TDU committed themselves to fight
    for real democracy in the Teamsters. They demanded that
    the members have the right to elect everybody from union
    steward to General President.</blockquote>

<p>The Fraternal Order of Steelhaulers (FASH) had been the most prominent 
of those advocating secession. They figured they had enough unity among 
their fellow workers to build a genuine, fighting union if they could just 
get the Teamster bureaucrats off their backs. Unfortunately, this program 
brought them up against the Teamsters bureaucrats, the employers (who 
hardly wanted a militant union), and TDU - which ultimately persuaded them 
to abandon their efforts to build their own union which could improve 
their conditions immediately in favor of a long-term (pie in the sky, when 
you die) boring-from-within strategy of trying to take over the entire 
International. In 1979, TDU merged with PROD and began lining up local 
officers, either by signing up existing officers or by electing "reform" 
candidates.</p>

<p>Those early victories reinforced an already existing tendency to focus 
on taking over the union offices, rather than building a genuinely 
democratic, grassroots union (a strategy more easily accomplished outside 
the Teamsters, of course). In 1980, TDU activist Dave Wolfinsohn warned 
that, "Uncertain that they can spur direct action against the employers, 
some TDUers have tended to seek substitutes... In particular, there is a 
tendency to look to union elections, to alliances with dubious union 
officials, and to protracted lawsuits." He saw the original IS strategy as 
revolving around building a "movement from below" with its own independent 
existence, not merely serve as a front for the sponsoring party. The TDU 
structure and newspaper were intended to give this movement coherence and 
some visibility.</p>

<p>Despite the pivotal role IS has played in building TDU, it would be a 
mistake to attribute too much importance to IS's political agenda. While 
IS has been able to use its position in TDU to push its pet hobby horses 
and to expand its influence into other unions through the 
IS-owned-and-operated Labor Notes, in many ways IS remade itself in 
response to the demands the TDU strategy placed upon it. Originally IS was 
a fairly open, left Troskyist party. But Trotskyist politics proved an 
obstacle to organizing rank-and-file Teamsters (and indeed to IS's boring 
from within the labor movement as a whole), and the politics were quickly 
reduced to attempts to reach out to minority workers and occasional bouts 
of internationalism (although this can be abandoned when opportunism 
demands - TDU raised no objections to Carey's fiercely nationalistic 
flag-waving, America-first rhetoric).</p>

<p>Even the traditional Trotskyist chimera of the Labor Party was kept out 
of the TDU program (although IS advocated it fervently in their magazine, 
Changes (now merged into Against The Current), and in Labor Notes). 
Instead, TDU and IS have bulled inexorably toward "pragmatic" policies - 
particularly towards efforts towards electoralism and alliances with "out" 
officials. IS underwent a split over these issues, and entered a seemingly 
irreversible decline resulting in large part from its submersion into 
union reform efforts. IS could not recruit effectively in the unions it 
operated within for fear of alienating the rank-and-file, but so much of 
their energy and resources went into boring-from-within that IS by and 
larged ceased to function in the outside world. The result was that IS 
became increasingly irrelevant to its own members (once the union reform 
efforts got off the ground they were largely self-perpetuating) and to 
broader movement politics. And so, a few years ago, IS (after rejecting a 
proposal to bore from within Democratic Socialists of America and take 
that organization over) dissolved itself into a new "multi-tendency 
socialist organization," Solidarity - which brought former IS members, 
exiles from the Socialist Workers Party, and freelance Marxists into a 
looser, but larger organization.</p>

<p>IS's collapse is of little concern to syndicalists. Far more important 
is the ways in which its policies diverted Teamster rank- and-file efforts 
from attempting to build shop-floor resistance to the bosses into the 
seemingly easier channels of electing "reformers" to union office or 
revising union bylaws. Over the years TDU had many successes with this 
strategy - that is, several TDU-backed candidates did in fact become union 
bureaucrats (and many union bureaucrats made alliances with TDU). With the 
U.S. government take-over of the Teamsters, TDU was able to follow the 
logic of this position into the union's highest levels.</p>

<p>But there is little reason to expect that these TDU Executive Board 
members will make much diference. As Wolfinsohn noted 13 years ago, 
"Anyone who takes top office... without having first built an independent 
organization of the rank and file (not just voters) committed to direct 
action by the ranks... will hold office but not be able to do anything 
with it." He pointed to the conservative influence of the entrenched 
bureaucracy, to the inability to win against the bosses without strong 
rank-and-file action, and to the sorry results of TDU's early forays into 
union elections. TDU won several elections in 1978, only to see the 
"rebel" bureaucrats quickly assimilated. TDU's emphasis on working within 
the Teamsters structure led it not only to reject secession, but also to 
undermine efforts to build wildcat strikes (instead pressuring the 
bureaucrats to call official strikes - even when successful, the 
bureaucrats controlled the resulting strikes and settled them on their own 
terms).</p>

<p>TDU relied upon lawsuits, union elections and appeals to union officers 
instead of organizing the rank and file to act in their own behalf. 
Efforts by more militant members to broaden this approach were uniformly 
rejectedas irrelevant or likely to scare off potential recruits. TDU's 
1981 convention rejected efforts to declare TDU support for the right to 
strike (even where prohibited by contract), to publish articles in the TDU 
Convoy Dispatch on direct action tactics such as the secondary boycott, 
and even defeated a motion to require candidates for union office who run 
with TDU support to sign a statement saying they would stick by its 
program. (This motion was prompted by the fact that several dozen TDU 
Teamster office-holders refused to vote or speak for TDU positions at 
Teamsters conventions or to otherwise visibly support the movement which 
helped them into union office).</p>

<p>Today TDU sits atop the Teamsters, but they are having little more 
success in pursuing their policies. Where local officers genuinely want to 
put up a fight they can make a difference - primarily by not getting in 
the way. But few union bosses are interested in restructuring their locals 
or regionals to give more power to the rank-and-file, or in doing anything 
else that might endanger their cushy jobs. And many Teamsters locals are 
totally impervious to change from below - structured in such a way that 
membership control is inconceiveable. Many, perhaps most, Teamsters are 
members of large amalgamated locals that administer scores of contracts 
covering workers at different companies in a wide variety of industries, 
often scattered over vast territories. Members rarely meet Teamsters 
members outside of their own workplace; even if they were able to mount an 
effective electoral challenge to the entrenched incumbents (hardly likely 
under the circumstances), this organizational model separates the "union" 
local from its membership in ways that are extremely difficult to 
overcome. But these locals are not run by reformers, they are run by 
veteran bureaucrats who run their fiefdoms like businesses, collecting the 
dues (and paying themselves handsomely from the proceeds), making sure the 
members don't get too uppity, and often undercutting other union locals in 
their dealings with employers so as to get as many dues-paying members as 
possible under their umbrella.</p>

    <p><b>Boring from Within</b></p>

<p>In fairness, TDU never was a syndicalist organization - it aimed not to 
abolish the capitalist system, but rather to make the Teamsters union a 
more effective weapon in the battle for a bigger piece of the pie. But it 
is often pointed to as an example of what revolutionaries might accomplish 
were we only to switch our efforts from the admittedly difficult task of 
building revolutionary unions to the seemingly easier route of 
transforming the business unions from within. In many ways TDU has been 
successful - the "reformers" have taken control of the highest levels of 
the "union" (though their control is far shakier at lower levels), even if 
they have had to make major compromises to do so.</p>

<p>For more then 100 years, syndicalists have debated the merits of 
boring-from-within and of revolutionary unionism. The borers, originally 
inspired by their success in capturing control of the French CGT (though 
that control proved remarkably weak when put to the test - it proved much 
easier to capture union office than to build genuine working-class 
organizations), argued that it was necessary to go where the workers were 
and to work within their existing organizations to convert these to a more 
revolutionary position. In practice, this has generally translated into a 
policy of seeking union office, since business unions are run by their 
officers and any "pragmatic" attempt to change their direction is thus 
seemingly easier to direct from the top than from the bottom. Those who 
rejected this strategy have been denounced as impossibilists, divisive and 
sectarian.</p>

<p>But nonetheless the majority of the syndicalist movement has always 
rejected this boring-from-within strategy, recognizing that it is 
incompatible with our basic principles, and ineffective to boot. Instead 
we have argued for building revolutionary unions. The boring from within 
strategy necessarily implies that there is nothing fundamentally wrong 
with the business unions - that with a change of officers or a little 
tinkering with the bylaws they could be made into effective working-class 
organizations. But revolutionary unionists know that nothing could be 
further from the truth.</p>

<p>The business unions are based upon fundamentally flawed premises - that 
labor and management, at some basic level, have interests that can be 
harmonised, and that workers are incapable of running their own unions. 
While we support workers - whether members of business unions or not - 
whenever they find themselves engaged in the class war, we recognize that 
the business unions are organized not to prosecute the class war but 
rather to smooth over disputes. They are dues-collecting machines, whose 
continuity and stability rely upon a passive membership and industrial 
peace. The prized accomplishments of business unionism - their cadres of 
full-time union officers, their mandatory dues check-off, their national 
arbitration procedures, government-certified union representation - are 
directly contrary to the real interests of the workers whose dues support 
the business unions, and indeed were developed precisely to circumvent 
workers' control of their own organizations.</p>

<p>Revolutionary unionists propose a fundamentally different concept of 
unionism - one based upon the workers ourselves, organized at the point of 
production. We recognize that anti- hierarchical, democratic organizations 
cannot be built within hierarchical organizations - let alone from the 
hierarchy itself. Revolutionary unionism requires that we develop new ways 
of pursuing our struggles and our vision for the future - one based on 
direct action and self-organization.</p>
