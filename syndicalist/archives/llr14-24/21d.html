<p class="blackbar">Editorial- Two Conceptions of Unionism</p>

<p>The ongoing struggle to unionize the giant U.S. bookstore chain, 
Borders Books (operating under the Borders, Brentano's, Planet Music and 
Waldenbooks names), illustrates two utterly incompatible ideas of 
unionism. While the United Food & Commercial Workers holds to the AFL-CIO 
model of business unionism - seeing the union as a social service agency, 
relying on a professional staff to 'service' workers who buy its services 
through payroll deductions - the Industrial Workers of the World adheres 
to a more traditional model of unionism, one which sees the union as a 
body of workers coming together to gain through their collective action 
the better conditions they can not hope to win alone. Under this model, 
which has long since been abandoned by the vast majority of labor 
organizations, a union does not rely on government certification or Labor 
Relations Board proceedings. Rather, unions rely upon workers' own power, 
recognizing that government "protections" are at best a means of 
compensating workers long after the fact for the violation of their most 
basic rights - when after the union itself has been crushed. (More often, 
they serve to frustrate workers' efforts, and to divert them into endless 
bureaucratic channels.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately many workers have fallen for aspects of business 
unionism, even within revolutionary unions such as the IWW. Thus, Wobblies 
at one retail outlet in the San Francisco area recently decided that while 
their fellow workers were ready for a union, it would be too difficult to 
win a majority to the IWW. So instead they formed an organizing committee 
of IWW members and tried to organize their fellow workers into the UFCW. 
(Bay area Wobblies have also mounted several organizing campaigns in their 
own right in recent years, including an ongoing campaign at the giant 
Wherehouse Entertainment music and video chain.) Leaving aside the fact 
that the UFCW is a particularly disgusting example of business unionism 
with a long history of selling out its members and signing sweetheart 
contracts with the bosses (it is so ineffective at defending its members' 
interests that the first pay hike tens of thousands of UFCW members saw in 
recent years came with the recent increase in the federal minimum wage), 
such tactics are incompatible with basic union principles. (They are also 
ineffective; UFCW bureaucrats and the Wobbly committee inevitably dashed 
on strategy and the drive was defeated.) For these tactics are based on a 
faulty premise - that a union exists by virtue of government 
certification.</p>

<p>The result of such mistaken premises are disoranizing campaigns urging 
workers to vote for union "representation," meanwhile setting their 
grievances aside until their representatives are certified to deal with 
them. When, as in this case, the election is lost workers are left 
defenseless (ideologically and organizationally) against the bosses. Yet 
in this workplace there were several Wobblies committed. to fighting for 
better conditions. Had they had the courage of their Wobbly convictions, 
they could have established an IWW branch on the job and begun mobilizing 
their fellow workers to fight for better conditions. At first they would 
have been a small minority, of course, but as they agitated and organized 
they could have established a living, breathing, fighting union presence 
on the job - one much stronger because it was based upon the workers 
themselves, rather than a scrap of paper from the government or a bunch of 
high- paid bureaucrats in an office across town.</p>

<p>In contrast, the IWW drive at Borders culminated years of IWW 
organizing efforts among low-paid service, educational and retail workers 
in Philadelphia. And at least some Borders workers turned to the IWW 
precisely because of its broader social vision. But the Borders campaign, 
too, was afflicted by symptoms of business unionism. Although this drive 
was conducted under IWW auspices, Philadelphia Wobs sought the "easy" road 
of government certification eventually trimming their sails in a desperate 
scramble to hold on to a majority of voters as managers chipped away at 
their initial majority with threats and promises. They narrowly lost that 
vote and, barred from from going back to the National Labor Relations 
Board for another year and without any apparent realization that the 20 
workers (of 45) who had voted for the IWW could act as a union regardless 
of government certification, the workers lapsed into depressed apathy.</p>

<p>Management seized on the situation to crush not only that drive, but 
also fledgling IWW efforts at other Borders stores across the country. 
Suspected union supporters were interrogated, threatened and harassed and 
on June 15, 1996, Borders fired Miriam Fried, one of the most active 
Wobblies in the Philadelphia store.</p>

<p>By then, most Wobblies in that store had despaired. Some were looking 
for other jobs, others turned to the UFCW. When FW Fried was fired there 
was no organized reaction from the Wobblies on the job. But an IWW 
organizer who had been working with the Borders drive put out word of the 
firing over the internet and it was quickly picked up by Wobs. On June 
17th, two members of the Boston IWW Branch entered the downtown Boston 
Borders and demanded to speak to the manager. When she insisted that 
Borders' firing of a worker for supporting the union was none of her 
concern Wobblies set up a picket line in front of the store and began 
leafletting customers and passersby. Picketing continues to this day, and 
has been taken up by Wobblies at dozens of Borders outlets across the 
country (including in Philadelphia).</p>

<p>While the UFCW responded to the firing by promising to file a piece of 
paper with the government begging it to protect workers' rights to 
organize, the IWW responded with direct action - hitting the bosses where 
it hurt. There is no evidence that the paperwork has had any effect on 
Borders, but Borders managers have been frantically working the phone 
lines and spreading corporate disinformation to counter the IWW's efforts. 
Far from defending workers' rights against Borders' flagrant imtimidation 
the UFCW has asked Wobblies to take down the picket lines in several 
cities, and has even taken to calling people and urging them to cross the 
picketlines and patronize the union busters.</p>

<p>Nearly 40 Borders stores from Portland, Maine, to Los Angeles, and from 
Miami, Florida, to Tacoma, Washington, were picketed December 14th and 
15th in a national protest to increase the pressure on the chain Tens of 
thousands of leaflets have been distributed to Borders customers informing 
them of the dispute. Sales reports since the campaign began show that 
Borders is losing ground to rival Barnes & Noble.</p>

<p>Whether or not the campaign is able to build an IWW presence at Borders 
or get Miriam Fried her job back, it has shown that the IWW's relatively 
small membership is fully capable of mounting a solidarity campaign that 
puts much larger unions to shame. Within a few days of the firing, IWW 
members were sharing leaflets on the internet, creating web pages about 
the dispute, picketing Borders stores across the country, and putting the 
company on notice that it could not act against workers with impunity. 
While it continues to threaten and intimidate workers, Borders has not 
fired any union activists since the campaign began and has retracted and 
apologized for a warning issued to another IWW supporter for discussing 
working conditions and the need for a union with her fellow workers. 
Workers across the country have seen evidence that the IWW is still 
fighting the bosses.</p>

<p>The campaign has provided a nationally visible focus for IWW activities 
- the first time in many years that the IWW has organized around a common 
project. In the early stages of the campaign, an IWW member was quoted by 
a newspaper saying that the IWW was too small to take on a national 
campaign and so would have to defer to the UFCW. But while a few IWW 
members have followed that defeatist logic, more have recognized that 
numbers only count if they are mobilized; that a huge membership 
disorganized into a business union can not begin to match what can be 
accomplished by a genuine union, one which turns to its members to act for 
themselves in accordance with that venerable principle, An Injury to One 
Is An Injury to All.</p>
