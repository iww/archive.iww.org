<p class="blackbar">Editorial: How to Build the International</p>

<p>At its conference on Eastern Europe and Russia last fall, the 
International Workers Association (IWA) decided to give the responsibility 
for publishing its Eastern European newsletter to the IREAN (Initiative of 
Revolutionary Anarchists). The IREAN is a small propaganda group which 
split from the KAS (Anarcho Syndicalist Confederation) a couple years ago. 
This development startled members of KAS, who had hoped to maintain good 
relations with the IWA, and see little hope that this will be the case 
with IREAN filtering the information which the IWA gets about the 
syndicalist movement in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Perhaps 
what should trouble the international syndicalist movement is the prospect 
that this may lead to IREAN's recognition as the IWA's affiliate in 
Russia, and put an end to IWA efforts to bring KAS and CMOT into the 
international.</p>

<p>We don't intend this to be a criticism of IREAN. We know very little 
about IREAN and its politics. What we question is the wisdom of the IWA in 
setting up an intermediary in its relations with Russian 
anarcho-syndicalists without getting input from the largest syndicalist 
organizations. The IREAN is a splinter group from KAS. It is therefore not 
in the interests of IREAN that the IWA be on good terms with KAS. Whether 
this was the IWA's intention or not, by giving official recognition to 
IREAN, the IWA is furthering a split in the syndicalist movement of that 
country and may be cutting itself off from the majority of Russian 
syndicalists. Bringing IREAN into the IWA may give the international 
another affiliate, but does this serve the cause of international 
unity?</p>

<p>This is not the first time the IWA has permitted sectarian syndicalist 
groups to draw the international into internal feuding. In 1984 we warned 
the IWA about a similar situation with a group of anti-IWW syndicalists, 
the Workers Solidarity Alliance (WSA), who were seeking recognition as the 
IWA's U.S. affiliate. The IWA ignored these warnings, and the WSA was 
given a blank check to carry on sectarian warfare against the IWW and 
pro-IWW anarcho- syndicalists, all in the name of the international. 
Perhaps it is not surprising that when the IWW passed a referendum in 
1989(?) to affiliate with the IWA, this received no follow-up from the 
IWA. The IWA decided it must rely on the judgement of WSA, who told them 
to ignore the IWW's prospective affiliation.</p>

<p>The policy of the IWA should be to seek the widest solidarity between 
syndicalist organizations of all countries. IWA Statutes allow only one 
affiliate in each country. This is supposed to discourage sectarian 
feuding. Ironically this rule has been used as a weapon by splinter groups 
to encourage it. Knowing that the IWA rarely refuses a request for 
affiliation from a country where no IWA section exists, these minority 
splinter groups take advantage of the IWA's goodwill. Once they are in the 
international, the IWA feels it must support these minority sections in 
their political feuds, without making a serious investigation into what 
these disputes are all about.</p>

<p>To build a strong international, the IWA needs to reassess its 
affiliation process. The goal must be to federate with the majority 
syndicalist organization in each country. Where splits have occurred or 
where a small propaganda group seeks IWA affiliate status, the IWA should 
try to get input from the majority organization before committing itself. 
Certainly foot-dragging by the larger group should not stop the IWA from 
having contact with sympathetic minorities. The IWA, however, needs to be 
more aware of the consequences of giving these minorities official 
recognition.</p>
