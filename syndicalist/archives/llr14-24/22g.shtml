<p class="blackbar">Anarcho-Syndicalism: A Historical Closed Door...or 
Not?</p>

<p><b>by Harald Beyer-Arnesen</b></p>

<p>Ilan Shalif, a libertarian communist whose thoughts I value even when I 
do not agree with the conclusions reached, made the following remarks on 
the electronic discussion list of class-struggle anarchists, Organise, 
which provoked the following thoughts. (However, he would not necessarily 
agree with all the positions I argue against below.) "Anarcho-syndicalist 
union is a myth and a dream that cannot be materialized in the capitalist 
society of this time. And if it could be, it would have been only of its 
members. Nothing can belong to the wider working class but the fact that 
its members are exploited by the capitalist class. ... I still can not see 
at present any anarcho-syndicalist union that is not so only in name. 
(Either it is not a union or it is already on the way of co-option and 
reformism.) ... In the capitalist society of the 2000s, it is hard to 
imagine any practical union which is not big and co-opted. It is entirely 
different thing with regard to workers committees in a not too huge 
conglomerate....</p>

<p>"It is like in wave surfing at the sea - you can "catch" waves, you 
cannot create them. In our struggles, we [libertarian communists] are part 
of the water, but the main variable is the wind of history - we can only 
contribute to it our breath.</p>

<p>"When the time will come that authentic workers unions will tend to 
become libertarian it will mean that the revolution is already on it."</p>

<p>Is anarcho-syndicalism, and revolutionary unionism in general, a 
historical closed door: a dream that cannot be materialized in the 
capitalist society of this time?</p>

<p>Contemporary story may seem to back up such a claim. In the post World 
War 11 period the syndicalist Central Organisation of Sweden's Workers 
(SAC) was transformed into a bleak shadow of its former self. This carries 
some significance as, with the exception of the French CGT in a much 
earlier period, SAC is the only revolutionary union never to be brutally 
suppressed. Meanwhile the Wobblies of the IWW are alive and kicking, but 
only 900 of them; the CNT after Franco is reduced to below ten thousand 
members, and in the very place of its former grandeur, Catalonia, is 
crumbling from inner tensions; the modest growth of the French CNT and 
Unione Sindicale Italiana produced passionate disputes on questions of 
co-option and reformism, and ended in splits; the German FAU is showing 
progress as far as newspaper production goes, but there is little sign of 
union-building; Solidarity Federation's industrial network in U. K. 
consists of half a hundred members; elsewhere the situation is pretty much 
like in Norway where NSF has kept it going since 1976 as a small 
propaganda group, with currently approximately 40 members spreading the 
message within the corporative unions. The renewed interest in Eastern 
Europe has so far produced nothing more. In the early historical 
strongholds of anarcho-syndicalism in South and Central America, the 
situation is even bleaker than in Europe. The most promising sign in a 
long term perspective may be the reappearance of the advocacy of 
revolutionary unionism in South Africa, and for the first time in Nigeria 
and Sierra Leone, but any union is at this point nowhere to be seen. The 
general picture Ilan paints of the current state of affairs is true 
enough, even if one could always argue over its complete accuracy, but 
that would mostly be on definitions.</p>

<p>But to permanently shut the historical door of anarcho-syndicalism, it 
is not enough to empirically determine its current state, and to disclose 
the mechanisms within contemporary capitalism working against building 
such a movement in the immediate future, one would also have to deny the 
possibility of its re-emergence in times when the class struggle 
intensifies, and more workers begin believing in a world beyond 
capitalism. The present marginality, and for the most part non-existence 
of revolutionary unionism, could very likely be said to be a reflection of 
the current generalized lack of confidence among workers in the very 
possibility to build a world without capitalist social relations. The 
question should also be asked: would building even a marginal 
revolutionary unionist structure at the present moment function as a 
vehicle for increased confidence in parts of the working class? I find 
reasons to believe that the answer to this is yes. But let us first take a 
look ahead.</p>

<p><b>The Link to the Future Society</b></p>

<p>It is logical for social revolutionaries to view the organizational 
question in the light of their ends; to find means consistent with the 
needs of a future global libertarian communist society, or here more 
particularly with the needs of a transition to such a society: the bridge 
to the organizational forms perpetually created anew within the boundaries 
of materiality by the needs, desires and imaginative powers of members of 
a free society.</p>

<p>We live in a world with an excessively developed division of labor. 
This makes the existence of horizontal links between workers critical to 
the success of asocial revolution. This is not an entirely new situation. 
The absence of pre-existing horizontal links was one of the main factors 
contributing to the failure of the Russian revolution, sustaining among 
workers a lack of confidence in their ability for self-management beyond 
the limits of the workplace.</p>

<p>Workers councils are predominantly structured around geographical units 
and are not adequate to deal with the day to day horizontal links of 
production in a non-bureaucratic manner. Thus it was no coincidence that 
it was through the soviets that the Bolsheviks first established their 
separate power, while the factory committees served as a base for 
opposition and workers' power during the short revolutionary period in 
Russia, a power which soon dissolved in the absence of functional 
horizontal ties.</p>

<p>While these are not unique to revolutionary syndicalism, and also 
bureaucratic unions maintain them, they are there only exceptionally 
direct links between workers in general: as a rule they bring the select 
few together and serve the function of isolating workers into mutual 
passivity, transforming mutual contact and aid into the business of a 
stratum of specialists cultivating the noble art of empty phrases - making 
any direct contact between workers in general suspect and 
illegitimate.</p>

<p><b>The Question of Permanent Organizations</b></p>

<p>Some social revolutionaries forswear any permanent large-scale working 
class organization within the framework of capitalism. As capitalism is 
the very raison d'etre of such organizations, these organizations, in 
trying to maintain their separate existence when the class struggle has 
reached a stage where this framework may be transcended, become 
institutionalised obstacles blocking the way for the full unfolding of the 
revolution. The revolution must create its own organizational forms; those 
which may endure and grow within the framework of capitalism will be 
inadequate to the needs of the social revolution. The unions in their 
function as brokers of labor power cannot escape the logic of capital, 
regardless of the political convictions of its delegates and the efforts 
to develop democratic union structures. It thus becomes critical to 
uncover the illusions of unionism and diffuse knowledge of working class 
struggles directed simultaneously against the employers and the union.</p>

<p>But following this logic, these anti-union struggles will be compelled 
to either transform themselves into alternative structures taking up in 
themselves the function of a union, or fall back to a situation of 
atomization within or without the corporative union structure. 
Consequently one is seemingly left with the illusionist trick of making 
atomization the springboard of the social revolution. More likely, the 
tacit assumption underlying this strategical thought is that a 
revolutionary ferment will arise from within the corporative union 
structure, thus making itself entirely dependent on the continued 
existence of this framework.</p>

<p>The critique of unionism contained within the above position is, 
however, not alien to anarcho-syndicalism The awareness of its inevitable 
contradictory nature is at very core of anarcho-syndicalism and the source 
of its vitality. In this it captures the fundamental reality of the 
working class within capitalism and inserts itself into the very terrain 
where social revolutions are born, and where they also repeatedly have 
been lost. Anarcho-syndicalism's contradictory nature at the same time 
constitutes its driving revolutionary force and puts it in jeopardy of 
being co-opted by the logic of capitalism. Therefore the great emphasis on 
institutionalized precautions to prevent the latter development and the 
re-occurring conflicts within anarcho-syndicalism.</p>

<p>The only guarantee against co-option is death, so it becomes 
self-evident that any permanent organizational structure within capitalism 
will perpetually run the risk of being co-opted, and as such become an 
obstacle in a revolutionary situation. But to counter the argument, would 
an organizational structure emerging in the heat of a revolutionary 
situation, composed of workers with most of their concrete experiences 
from within a bureaucratized, corporative union structure, or disorganized 
altogether, be less likely to be co-opted into either an old or new class 
relation? I think not. The opposite seems a far more rational judgement. 
The tendency to reformism and co-option which always will exist within 
revolutionary unionism (the "heroes" growing tired) constitutes one of its 
greatest assets. It forces these questions to be answered concretely on a 
day-to-day basis, and not just in an abstract future. I refuse to accept 
the logic that being accustomed to a greater degree of servility and 
passivity is a great asset in a revolutionary situation. Neither do I see 
any historical evidence supporting this view, but on the contrary an 
endless trail of blood and a line of tyrants giving witness to the 
opposite.</p>

<p>It may even be asked if the rejection by genuine revolutionaries of all 
permanent mass organizations is not the ultimate triumph of capitalist 
co-option.</p>

<p><b>The Question of Co-optation</b></p>

<p>Since the time of the emergence of a mass union movement, and the 
"glorious" period of revolutionary syndicalism, capitalism has greatly 
sophisticated the mechanism which enables it to integrate unions into its 
development. This process started the moment private and state capital 
felt compelled to accept the existence of unions.</p>

<p>This acceptance has everywhere been intimately bound to the condition 
that the unions through their representatives exercise a restraining and 
disciplinary influence, and when necessary use sanctions to keep their 
members within certain limits to the point where unions have become the 
main factor upholding capitalist stability. Some fragments of this history 
in two of the Scandinavian countries may illustrate this:</p>

<p>From 1905 the Swedish Employer's Association (SAF) started working 
towards a system of nationwide collective bargaining and binding, 
time-limited agreements. As is often the case, it was foremost the major 
industrial companies which saw the advantage of integrating unions into 
positions of shared responsibility, and the attendant consolidation of 
centralism such a process was bound to entail. As more and more binding 
agreements were entered on a national level between the member 
organizations of SAF and the social democratic union confederation LO, 
this left the syndicalist SAC, with its principled stand against such 
contracts in an entrenched position. What should be considered licit and 
illicit forms of industrial actions and procedures was agreed upon and 
later confirmed and institutionalized through the "Law on Collective 
Agreements and the Industrial Tribunal" of 1928. This law, which was to be 
followed up by others, became an instrument for connecting, not only 
injunctions and sanctions but likely more crucial, benefits such as 
unemployment insurance to what was regulated in nationwide contracts. 
Members of SAC were to be covered by these, even if their union refused to 
have any part in them. The law of 1928 stands out as a milestone in a 
process which effectively marginalized SAC, the expressed intention of 
both SAF and LO. Since then a thousand threads have been spun binding the 
employers associations, the unions and the state together in a web of 
interdependence.</p>

<p>In Norway, the national contracts were largely a result of the 
Norwegian Employer's Association's lock-out strategy. But from about 1911 
there had developed a strong syndicalist inspired opposition within LO 
advocating direct-action methods. In 1918 the Iron and Metal Worker's 
Federation resolved to lay the power of beginning and ending industrial 
actions in the hands of the workers directly affected, while the 
Workingman's Federation, the largest union at the time, resolved to 
abstain from signing local contracts, What went under the name, 
"recognized terms," had also increasingly supplanted written contracts 
locally. This led to a court decision in 1920 saying that the unions would 
be hold juridically responsible for the actions of their local branches, 
whether they chose to sign the contracts or not, thus undermining one of 
the principal reasons not to be an official party in any written contract: 
"to get away from the condition where the employers can force the union to 
intervene when irregularities occur."</p>

<p>The slave contracts as they were aptly called at the time, would not go 
away. Instead, around them an intricate web of laws and binding agreements 
were to regulate every potential and imaginal conflict between buyers and 
sellers of labor power. Within this framework there was no room left for 
revolutionary unionism... which in effect became unlawful. In the process 
workers gained something but the employers gained far more: stable 
conditions for the continued exploitation of labor, a pacified workforce, 
and a corpse of worker representatives extending from the top to the 
bottom levels, most of the times both capable and willing to sustain 
peace, order and a spirit of mutual responsibility for the welfare of 
capitalism, and with the state as the final, "neutral" arbiter.</p>

<p>This corporative structure may be most clearly expressed in countries 
like the Scandinavian ones with a high percentage of workers organized 
into passivity, but even in countries with a very low percentage of 
unionization, the overall conditions of the working class as a whole is 
largely determined within the framework of a the more or less corporative 
union-employer-state relation. This latter situation however tends to open 
up a wider potential field for action and organizational structures more 
difficult to control.</p>

<p>In places where unions are wholly or partially outlawed, and where 
consequently direct action often is the only channel for discontent left, 
the situation becomes less predictable and potentially explosive. 
Conditions vary somewhat from country to country. In India, according to 
one source from that part of the world, every union is a private 
enterprise, a money machine for its owner(s). There is no way out of 
studying unions and the situation they operate under concretely, but still 
what is most striking in the overall picture is that the moment unions 
gain some legality, there is a strong tendency that they are co-opted into 
a resemblance of the unionism of the former Soviet Union. Is not the 
AFL-CIO in many ways, if not in all, just such an outfit? Still, is this 
all unions could possibly become within contemporary capitalism?</p>

<p><b>The Cleavage in the Link</b></p>

<p>Workers will always organize themselves whenever they see the need, and 
they have the sufficient cohesion and collective strength to do so. Unions 
are simply not something we can avoid, even if we so wished: they are 
something capitalism imposes upon us, or to be more precise, capitalism 
imposes the situation which produces the need for them, and from this need 
we cannot escape before we take the world in our own hands. The more 
disorganized we are as workers - membership in corporative unions being 
often just a particular kind of disorganization, functioning largely as 
the organization of passivity and division - the more we will become a 
flexible material in the hands of others, and ruled by the logic of 
capital.</p>

<p>The labor contract, whether collective or individual, is by its very 
nature a disciplinary mechanism at the very foundation of capitalism. 
Entering into such contracts involves a conditional acceptance of the 
class relations. This is simply the prerequisite of survival of any 
worker, and not something one can withdraw from on the basis of one's 
political convictions.</p>

<p>As wage slaves - temporarily employed or unemployed, in the process of 
being formed as one, or already discarded - we are linked to the 
functioning of capitalism. But this linkage is not total; we are not the 
mere appendages of capital. Our acceptance is always conditional: In 
wildcat strikes and in an endless numbers of minor acts of sabotage and 
obstruction daily taking place at most every workplace, we temporarily 
withdraw it. There exists a cleavage in the link that can be widened or 
tightened, which also implies that the process described above is 
reversible. The contrary would also be sensational, implying that the 
structure of unions could somehow remain entirely unaffected by the 
general ebb and tide of the class struggle. The anarcho-syndicalist 
project is to make the forced acceptance of the class relation more and 
more conditional, until the final explosion of energy, dreams, thoughts 
and desires, where the linkage is broken, classes abolished and our free 
individual and collective creative powers are put in use to 
non-hierarchically rule the present and future, without the bondage 
imposed by the Siamese twins of state and capital.</p>

<p><b>To Catch the Winds</b></p>

<p>The rejection of anarcho-syndicalism out of fear of co-option has a 
slight similarity to the sailor who shrinks from learning to swim as he is 
concerned it might put his life in jeopardy.</p>

<p>To recreate anarcho-syndicalism may seem to be the vicious circle of 
being too few to set out and remaining so because the organization for 
workers to join is not there. Even when the first framework is set up, and 
there exists something you can begin talking of in terms of a union, many 
will say: "Could be a good idea, but far too small to be a union. If more 
workers join, I will consider it." Despite its legendary history this is 
pretty much the situation for the IWW today.</p>

<p>But this mechanism works both ways; having reached a certain level, an 
organization may suddenly enter into a fast growth. A similar effect may 
occur when the nucleus of revolutionary unionx pop up at several different 
places within a short period of time. There is even something to a name: 
the reaction an organization will be met with, it will be different when 
presenting itself as a propaganda group for an idea to be implemented 
somewhere in a distant future, than if it presents itself as a 
union-building organization based on certain principles. If a 
revolutionary union is what you want, it becoms essential to start 
building a structure which may be put in use (on a small scale) in the 
here and now for practical solidarity, and as such be viewed as a 
functional too by others.</p>

<p>However refined the methods of co-option are made, the winds of 
discontent will always be blowing. Recreating anarcho-syndicalism involves 
fanning the flames of discontent and disrespect towards bosses. But the 
structure must be there to channel and give extended life to these winds, 
suppling them with some direction and a greater strength by bringing them 
together. Our task consists in bulding direct links of some permanence 
between workers locally, within the limits of the state and globally, and 
from the workplace to the communities in which we live. And as an 
essential, integrated part of this, opening up spaces for collective 
discussions where the dream of a society beyond capitalism can be 
nourished.</p>

<p>At the present stage, building the structures of revolutionary unionism 
must be seen as a vehicle to awaken this dream within the working class of 
a world beyond capitalism. It is very hard to see how this could be done 
to any large extent within the framework of corporative unionism. 
Corporative unionism is beyond the state of reform. It must be 
deconstructed. Therefore also the importantce of an open 
anarcho-syndicalism.</p>

<p><b>Open Anarcho-Syndicalism</b></p>

<p>An open anarcho-syndicalism implies that solidarity is extended beyond 
the membership: To on a micro and macro level think in terms of the 
working class as a whole, and develop links of solidarity and practical 
coherence to the rank and file and local branches wholly or partially 
controlled by workers within the bureaucratised structure of the 
corporative unions. The union principle has no meaning outside a union of 
solidarity, which ultimate measure is not membership but practical 
solidarity.</p>

<p>While the workplace is the obvious point of departure for 
anarcho-syndicalism, it cannot see it as its limit, something which would 
tie it to the logic of capitalism. An instance of 
beyond-the-workplace-unionism is the struggles CNT has been engaged in 
against the closing down of the shipyards of Puerto Real, near Cadiz in 
the south of Spain, where the struggle was extended to the communities as 
a whole and to the conditions of life within them:</p>

<blockquote>"Every Thursday of every week, in the towns and villages in 
the area, we had all-village assemblies where anyone who was connected 
with the particular issue, whether they were actually workers in the 
shipyard itself, or women or children or grandparents, could go along to 
the village assembly and actually vote and take part in the 
decision-making process of what was taking place...</p>

<p>What we tried to do in Puerto Real is to show that the 
anarcho-syndicalist union is not just an industrial organization that 
takes on factory disputes, but rather has a much wider social and 
political aim. What we have tried to do in Puerto Real so far is to 
attempt to interlink various different disputes, taking on various 
struggles around education, around the provision of health services, 
cultural aspects, and we have been struggling against the proposed 
construction of a new golf course, the privatization of the cemetery, we 
have been fighting against various local tax increases..."</blockquote>

<center><p>Pepe Gomez of the CNT, October 1993.
        <br>From "Anarcho-Syndicalism in Puerto Real,"
        <br>published by Solidarity Federation/La Prensa,
        <br>1995. P.O. Box 73, Norwich, NR3 1QD, U.K.</p></center> 

<p>Direct action in the anarchist sense means making as far as possible 
the means into the ends, and thus bringing about a re-arrangement of the 
world on a small or large scale. By using our potential industrial power 
to accomplish this, we may not only bring about modest changes in our 
lives, but put our own and other worker's imagination on fire, opening up 
our eyes to the wide field of our potential powers. This is even more 
important in a time where capitalism has super-imposed itself as a social 
factory on increasingly larger parts of our lives, and where the division 
of labor has been driven to such extent that it becomes increasingly 
difficult to see, through the fog of atomization, that it is we who are 
producing this world as a whole.</p>

<p>It is often said, that even if large-scale revolutionary unions was 
still a possibility, they would never be able to organize the entire 
working class. This most likely is very true. At least it is not very wise 
to base a strategy on the opposite at this point in history. Thus 
membership should never been seen as an end in itself but as a means. 
There can be only one end: an all-inclusive global society borders, 
classes and hierarchies, and consequently also without states, and in the 
here and now to practice this as far as we can. But for this we have to 
start building the links between workers. Links which once created, we 
will gladly share and extend to others so long as it is on the basis of 
practical, non-hierarchical solidarity.</p>
