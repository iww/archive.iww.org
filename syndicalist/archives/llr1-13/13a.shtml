<p class="blackbar">Editorial: One more Nail in the Coffin</p>

<p>When UAW President Owen Bieber agreed to sent Caterpillar strikers back 
to work on April 14 under the terms of Cat management's final offer he 
drove another nail into the coffin of organized labor in the U.S.</p>
    
<p>Bieber's motive in capitulating to the world's largest earth moving 
equipment manufacturer was undoubtedly to preserve the jobs of 12,600 
striking workers (and the dues revenue generated for UAW coffers?) who 
were threatened with permanent replacement by scabs.</p>

<p>Alternatives to surrender, risky as they might be, could have been 
implemented. Mass picketing, plant occupations, or a combination of both 
could have bee set up to keep out any scabs. Thousands of unionists in the 
midwest who were anxious to come to the Cat strikers' aid would have 
responded to a call for active support. (On March 22, over 20,000 workers 
took part in a solidarity rally held in Peoria, Illinois; there had been 
short sympathy strikes of Cat workers in South Africa and Belgium, and 
even some talk of a general strike in some UAW locals.)</p>

<p>However, one has to wonder if other alternative tactics were even 
considered before the decision to surrender was reached. Although there 
has been some talk recently of implementing a work- to-rule to bring some 
pressure to bear on Cat management, the seeming lack of any creative 
thinking about strategy and tactics in the current economic climate only 
underlines the total bankruptcy of business unionism.</p>

<p>The capitalists declared war on labor over ten years ago, and the 
casualties suffered in this decade should have convinced any sober 
unionist - even a reformist one - that the long battle of attrition-style 
strikes is suicide. Not only that, the UAW's failure to organize any 
pre-strike actions to reduce Cat inventory going into the strike shows the 
severe short-sightedness, approaching blindness, of the trade union 
leadership. In addition, the fact that the rank-and-file were not even 
consulted, let alone allowed to vote, on the decision to return to work 
indicates that the business union leadership is more afraid of an active 
rank-and- file than anything else.</p>

<p>Of course, negotiations between UAW leaders, Cat executives and a 
federal mediator could produce a slightly improved contract for Cat 
workers. But the rank-and-file will remain largely marginal to the 
process, and this is the crux of the matter. The passivity and lack of 
self-organization of the rank-and-file makes the defense of hard-won 
conditions, let alone their improvement, virtually impossible - not only 
for Cat workers but for workers in all sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>Only when we decide to organize ourselves into self-managed, 
revolutionary class unions that recognize the irreconcilable conflict 
between labor and capital will we have the power to win.</p>
