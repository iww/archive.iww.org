<p class="blackbar">North American Free Trade?</p>

<p>As the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Free Trade Agreement talks continue on the 
fast-track, the labor movement - and in particular its left wing - is 
mobilizing its efforts in a last-ditch effort to block an agreement they 
say will devastate the U.S. and Canadian economies. The Canadian Labor 
Congress estimates that 260,000 jobs have already been lost as a result of 
the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (though they clearly didn't find 
their way down to the States, as is evidenced by the continuing 
recession), and the AFL- CIO expects that two and a half million jobs 
would go to Mexico if the Free Trade Agreement goes through.</p>

<p>The government has been relatively open about the rationale for a Free 
Trade Agreement: "By lowering overall costs of U.S. manufacturing firms, a 
free trade agreement would make U.S. firms more competitive..." (1991 
Economic Report of the President) This competitiveness might be realized 
by moving production to Mexico or by driving U.S. wages closer to Mexican 
levels. Either approach makes U.S. firms "more competitive" entirely at 
the expense of their workers.</p>

<p>Mexican workers are clearly cheaper than their North American 
counterparts, and getting cheaper all the time. High inflation and a 
rapidly devaluing Peso have resulted in average Mexican labor costs (wages 
and benefits) dropping from $3.71 in 1981 to $1.57 in 1987, and the 
Mexican economy is in free-fall. The Mexican government tightly controls 
the major labor federation, and forcefully intervenes against militant 
unions and unionists.</p>

<p>The result has been a cheap, relatively disciplined (though not always 
docile) workforce conveniently located to manufacture products for North 
American markets. Many firms have moved their manufacturing operations to 
Mexico, in particular to low-wage "maquiladora" districts near the U.S. 
border. U.S.-based companies have long had extensive investments in 
Mexico, dominating its auto, rubber, mining and chemical industries even 
before the maquiladora program began in 1965. The maquiladoras manufacture 
products almost entirely for U.S. and other foreign markets, and are 
largely exempted from U.S. import duties. Last year, about 500,000 workers 
were employed in 2007 maquiladoras, almost all of them owned by U.S. 
companies.</p>

<p>U.S.-based companies have proven eager to expand operations in Mexico 
(just as in other low-wage economies). Two years ago, Levi- Strauss shut 
down a San Antonio plant, throwing more than 1,000 workers out of their 
jobs. Last year, Pillsbury-Green Giant laid off nearly 400 workers from 
its frozen food plant in Watsonville, California, to shift their unionized 
jobs to a non-union plant in Mexico which pays workers only $4 per day. 
Louisiana-Pacific has closed a California plant and built a 
state-of-the-art sawmill in Suarez, where it has already successfully 
broken the longshore union by shutting down production for several days 
and threatening to close the plant altogether. And Procter-Silex (a 
manufacturer of irons, coffee makers, and similar items) recently closed 
two profitable North Carolina plants to shift production to Juarez.</p>

<p>Already, corporations are blackmailing workers and governments in 
towns, states and entire countries - using their mobility (made possible 
by improved communication and transportation networks, and by the 
increasingly global economy) to pit us against our fellow workers around 
the world. Each concession we make to save our jobs is then used as 
leverage to force concessions somewhere else, and the cycle soon returns 
to slash our wages and/or working conditions again. The record clearly 
demonstrates that companies do not use their savings from concessions or 
tax breaks to modernize, they take the money and run. As a result, what 
happens to our $1-a-day Vietnamese fellow workers affects us as directly 
as what happens to our fellow workers in Alabama.</p>

<p>(Environmentalists, too, oppose the Free Trade Agreement, arguing that 
it will result in environmental safeguards being abandoned as impediments 
to "competitiveness" or as illegal restraints on trade. However, the U.S. 
has long attacked environmental standards on such grounds, as in the 
recent decision to resume clear-cutting in public forests in Oregon even 
though this will likely result in the extinction of the spotted owl.)</p>

<p>As we noted in LLR 2 ("What's To Protect?"), however, maintaining 
existing trade barriers or building new ones is not an effective response. 
The American economy died long ago, and had been replaced by a global 
economy in which most products long ago ceased to have any meaningful 
country of origin. The 1992 Ford Crown Victoria, for example, is assembled 
in Canada using parts from Britain, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Spain and the 
U.S., while Toyota Corollas are assembled by a jointly owned GM-Toyota 
plant in California. Harvard economist Robert Reich notes that "almost any 
product weighing more than 10 pounds and costing more than $10 is a global 
composite, combining parts or services from many different nations."</p>

<p>As long as our present economic system continues, the bosses will shift 
manufacturing - and, increasingly, even service industries - around the 
world to wherever they make the most money. Governments that obstruct this 
process will quickly be brought to heel through the enormous economic 
pressures transnational capital can bring to bear.</p>

<p>We can't hope to gain anything by supporting "our" bosses against the 
other guys, whether across the border or across the sea. Free trade or no 
free trade, the bosses will always go where the money's best, where unions 
are weak, where they can maim workers and pollute the environment to their 
heart's content. They won't be stopped by legislation (the Free Trade 
Agreement isn't even drafted yet, but employers have been setting up shop 
in Mexico for decades) or by patriotic sentiment.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean that they can't be stopped. The flow of low-paid 
jobs to South Korea is slowing and employers are fleeing their 
increasingly militant Korean workers in search of new low- wage production 
sites. Rather than trying to make common cause with our exploiters against 
our fellow workers abroad, we would do far better to assist our fellow 
workers in their struggles to build militant, independent unions and to 
win better working and living conditions. As long as workers anywhere are 
repressed and poverty- stricken, the bosses will find a way to exploit 
their misery - and to spread that misery, as best they can, to the rest of 
us. But if we are organized internationally to fight for our own 
interests, we can put the bosses on the run.</p>
