<p class="blackbar">European Alternative Unions Meet</p>

<p><i>The following report is based on Jacques Toubles' article, "Recontre 
europeene des syndicats alternatifs," published in January in Le Monde 
Libertaire.</i></p>
    
<p>A "Meeting of European Alternative Trade Unions" was held in Barcelona, 
Spain, Nov. 29 through Dec. 1, 1991, sponsored by the Spanish General 
Confederation of Workers (CGT). Attending the three day conference were 
delegations from union confederations such as the Swedish Workers Central 
(SAC) and the Romande Confederation of Labor; autonomous workers' groups 
such as the Italian base committees (Cobas) and an Irish 
anarcho-syndicalist group; local trade unions or federations affiliated 
with "official" union centers, for example a delegation of railway workers 
from the French Confederation of Democratic Unions (CFDT) and the Proof 
Readers Union of the French General Confederation of Workers (CGT); some 
organizations formed by fellow workers excluded from the main 
confederations such as the SUD Postal Federation; and, finally, a 
delegation from the Moscow section of the Russian Confederation of 
Anarcho-syndicalists (KAS) and some militants from the Russian Solidarity 
trade union.</p>

<br>    
<p><b>The New European Order</b></p>

<p>In discussing the developing political/economic landscape in Europe, 
the Spanish CGT delegates noted that the new order being constructed in 
the various Ministerial cabinets, in Brussels, and in the board rooms of 
the multi-national corporations will undoubtedly mean an increase in 
inequality and poverty within nations and in different regions of the 
continent, as well as reduction of trade union rights and restrictions on 
the right to strike. It was estimated that two million people would be 
added to the fifteen million already unemployed. In addition, there are at 
least six million workers toiling under temporary or part-time work 
contracts, and fifty million people living in poverty. The drive towards 
the privatization of public services is going ahead, and will most likely 
result in a further increase in part- time and temporary contract labor. 
Underneath all of this is developing a parallel society made up of 20 
million immigrants.</p>

<p>The Swedish delegation made special note of the changing division of 
labor being constructed and the greater stratification of the labor force 
that this will engender. They see the working class being sub-divided into 
three groupings: 1) a highly skilled stratum of technical workers with 
secure employment organized within corporatist trade unions whose only 
function will be to protect their status; 2) a less skilled and more 
precariously employed group; and 3) a totally marginalized group without 
skills and without employment. Such a development would make achieving 
political and economic unity among the three groups very difficult, which 
would be to the advantage of the capitalists an the State.</p>

<br>    
<p><b>Rank and File Action</b></p>

<p>The fellow workers from the Italian Cobas discussed the growing 
importance of the base committees, which are primarily found in the public 
services but are also present in the metal industry. In the past few years 
the committees have proven their ability to successfully mobilize workers 
within local branches of industry and even within entire industries both 
on a regional and on a national level, thus making them a force to be 
reckoned with. Thanks to this type of organization (the base committee) a 
number of trades - teachers, rail workers - have been able to successfully 
resist employers' plans to reduce their standard of living and working. On 
the railroads, for example, Italy is the only nation in Western Europe 
where the practice of operating locomotives with two crew members is still 
in force, thanks largely to the efforts of the base committees in 
mobilizing resistance to the attempts to introduce one-person operation. 
This hard struggle has twice resulted in the conscription of the entire 
rail workforce by the government, something that hadn't been seen since 
the fascist era.</p>

<br>    
<p><b>From the Ex-USSR</b></p>

<p>Of particular interest at the conference was the report of the Russian 
delegates of the KAS. The KAS comrade acknowledged that the organization 
was going through a difficult period with a number of fellow workers 
leaving the organization. These defections can be explained by the fact 
that when the KAS was formed there were no other libertarian groupings in 
the USSR and some joined the group without really understanding what the 
KAS was all about. When the organization defined itself, in its congress, 
as an organization made up of anarcho-syndicalists and anarchists engaged 
within the workers movement, those who disagreed drew the proper 
conclusion and withdrew from the organization, not without first accusing 
the KAS of being bureaucrats, etc.</p>
