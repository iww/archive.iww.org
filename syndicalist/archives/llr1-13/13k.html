<p class="blackbar">Excommunicated? WSA vs. LLR</p>

<p>The following exchange of letters, we believe, speaks for itself. We 
regret the fact that the "Workers Solidarity Alliance" continues to be 
successful in its efforts to sow dissension and disunity in the 
anarcho-syndicalist movement. We have no interest in arguing with WSA, but 
we will not allow their ceaseless attacks against ourselves and our 
comrades to proceed unrebutted.</p>
    
<blockquote>To the editors:</p>
    
<p>We of the Workers Solidarity Alliance were disturbed to find that issue 
#11 of <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i> continues the long series of 
attacks on the WSA and its members by LLR. These attacks have been going 
on for years now. Why, in all that time, has no one from your paper 
attempted to engage us in civil, comradely dialogue? Why have you spent so 
much time and effort on perpetuating this rift, rather than on trying to 
solve it?</p>
    
<p>If you have problems with our politics or with the way we conduct 
ourselves, join us in an open discussion of these issues, a discussion 
focussed on real issues rather than on imagined slights or useless 
mudslinging. Let's discuss the real nature of this disupte without the 
inflammaroty rhetoric and untruths that have been so much a part of LLR's 
attacks on the WSA.</p>
    
<p>We invite you to enter into an open dialogue with us. Whether you 
choose to do so or not, we must demand that you cease your attacks on the 
Workers Solidarity Alliance and all individual members of the WSA. If you 
refuse to do so, you leave us with no alternative but to request that the 
IWA institute a formal ban on relations with your group, as has been done 
with hostile groups in the past. WSA is the US affiliate to the IWA and an 
attack on us is an attack on the IWA.</p>
    
<p>We have absolutely no interest in deepening the conflict between our 
groups. The cause of anarcho-syundicalism can only benefit from improved 
relations between WSA and LLR. We hope that you will choose dialogue over 
diatribe and work with us to resolve our differences.</blockquote>

<p>LLR Note: We received this threatening letter just three weeks prior to 
the 1992 International Workers Association (AIT) Congress. We believe it 
to be a response to "The Specter Haunting Wetzel," published in LLR 12. 
That article was a response to attacks against LLR circulated by WSA 
leader Tom Wetzel at the 1991 Convention of the Industrial Workers of the 
World, in which Wetzel claimed that LLR was behind a conspiracy against 
WSA within the IWW. As we pointed out in that article, these charges were 
a smokescreen for WSA's maneuvering to keep the IWW from affiliating to 
the AIT (interestingly, in WSA's magazine ideas & action #16, Hutton 
discusses the possibility of the IWW joining the AIT: "The best thing that 
could happen is that the IWW decide this is not something they want to do 
and just drop it..."). WSA International Secretary Mitchell Miller writes, 
in Direct Action, that IWW affiliation to the AIT "is now moot."</p>

<p>In response to WSA's threat to cut off our communications with the AIT, 
we sent the following letter to the AIT Congress and to those AIT sections 
for which we have addresses:</p>

<blockquote>Fellow Workers,</p>
    
<p>The <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i> sends greetings to the IWA 
Congress. The tasks facing the international anarcho-syndicalist movement 
are immense. In virtually every country of the world, transnational 
capitalist employers pit the workers of each country against workers of 
other countries. National governments and the official labor unions assist 
the employers by telling workers that they must compete with foreign labor 
if they wish to keep their jobs. The IWA is one of the few labor 
federations which seeks to turn international working-class solidarity 
from a slogan into practical reality. As an anarcho-syndicalist journal we 
are committed to the same goals as the IWA, and hope that you continue to 
make progress.</p>
    
<p>The <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i> is committed to building solidarity 
between anarcho-syndicalists worldwide by providing information about 
revolutionary unions. Every issue of the LLR carries news of the IWA and 
its sections. This information might otherwise be unavailable in North 
America. For example, we know of no other U.S. publication (aside from the 
Industrial Worker, which reprinted our report) that reported on the 
general strikes against the Gulf War called by the USI and sections of the 
Cobas. We also review IWA literature and reprint articles from your press. 
And each issue of LLR includes the IWA's Principles of Revolutionary 
Syndicalism, which we endorse.</p>
    
<p>The members of our collective have also shown solidarity with the IWA 
in our practical work. When the CNT 'renevados' split from the CNT-AIT, 
our members defended the CNT-AIT and helped influence the Industrial 
Workers of the World to adopt its policy of recognizing only the CNT-AIT. 
Our members pass along IWA news and communiques to the IWW press as we 
receive them. For many years we have encouraged the IWW to affiliate with 
the IWA, and we hope that this will be accomplished soon.</p>
    
<p>Unfortunately, on March 20 we received an official notice from Ginger 
Hutton, National Secretary of the Workers Solidarity Alliance, objecting 
to an article in issue #12 of our journal. (Hutton says she is objecting 
to #11, which mentions WSA only in an index to our first 10 issues - her 
confusion may have been caused by a production error which resulted in 
pages of #12 being misnumbered.) That article criticized a leaflet 
attacking us that was circulated by WSA leaers at the IWW's 1991 General 
Assembly. Although the main point of our article was self-defense, Hutton 
accuses LLR of attacking WSA and issues an ultimatum: "we must... cease 
[our] attacks on the Workers Solidarity Alliance and all individual 
members of the WSA" or WSA will ask the IWA to "institute a formal ban on 
relations with your group" since "an attack on [WSA] is an attack on the 
IWA."</p>
    
<p>We believe that the role of the anarcho-syndicalist press is not just 
to give blanket praise to any group or individual claiming to be 
anarcho-syndicalist, but to also criticize them for their mistakes. A free 
and critical press plays a vital role in maintaining liberty for 
rank-and-file workers and in holding our officials accountable. The point 
of our article in LLR #12, which so offended WSA, was that WSA does not 
want to see the IWW affiliate with the IWA and has tried to make LLR into 
a scapegoat to conceal this fact. In the most recent issue of WSA's 
journal, Ideas and Action (#16, p. 36), Ginger Hutton admits that WSA is 
opposed to the IWW joining the international: "The best thing that could 
happen is that the IWW decides this is not something they want to do and 
just drop it... I really don't think it's something that's going to 
happen."</p>
    
<p>This simply reflects long-standing WSA policy. When representatives of 
the Libertarian Workers Group (the WSA's earlier name) attended the 1984 
IWA Congress, they urged the IWA to drop its efforts to get the IWW to 
affiliate. WSA also made several derogatory remarks about the IWW, which 
amounted to a false charge that the IWW was class collaborationist. When 
our group of anarcho- syndicalists, active in the IWW, found out about 
this, we wrote an open letter to the IWA to protest these attacks. Thus, 
our 'quarrel' with WSA dates back to what we saw as a divisive and 
sectarian report they made against the IWW.</p>
    
<p>While the <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i> has serious differences with 
the WSA over how to build an anarcho-syndicalist movement in North 
America, we wholly support the IWA's priciples. We believe that 
revolutionary unionism and international working-class solidarity are 
essential to the construction of a free, self- managed society. 
Familiarity with the activities, tactics, goals and aspirations of our 
fellow workers around the world is essential to building such 
solidarity.</p>
    
<p>At present, we exchange publications with several IWA sections, and 
would gladly add other IWA sections to our exchange list. On occasion, the 
IWA Secretariat has sent us copies of communiques, which we have published 
in our journal and sent to other labor papers and sympathetic 
organizations. We would very much appreciate it if we could receive such 
information on a regular basis, and if we could be provided with copies of 
the resolutions and other materials acted on by the 
Congress.</blockquote>

    <center><p>For international working-class solidarity,
    <br><i>Libertarian Labor Review</i> Collective</p></center>

<p>We subsequently received the following resolution from the newly 
elected AIT General Secretary, Jose Jimenez:</p>

<p><i>"On XIX I.W.A. Congress our resolution is condemning the unjustified 
attacks on the U.S. section by the </i>Libertarian Labor Review<i> group 
and given that these attacks have not ceased the I.W.A. shall declare a 
boycott of this group and all sections shall cease to have formal 
relations with them, until such time as they cease their attacks on the 
W.S.A. and clearly recognize them as the U.S. section of the I.W.A. 
Valencia, 5.12.92"</i></p>

<p>We responded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Fellow Worker Jiminez,</p>
    
<p>We recently received the congress resolution you forwarded on May 12th, 
and must admit that we find it quite perplexing.</p>
    
<p>Your resolution refers (1) to our "unjustified attacks" against the 
Workers Solidarity Alliance, (2) infers that we refuse to recognize them 
as the A.I.T.'s U.S. section, and (3) calls upon all sections to cease to 
have formal relations with us.</p>
    
<p>We do not know what to make of this. We are unaware of having made any 
unjustified attacks against the W.S.A. Indeed, to the best of our 
knowledge we have never published any criticism of W.S.A. for which we did 
not have documentation. We would appreciate receiving a list of all 
"unjustified attacks" against W.S.A. published in our journal so that we 
may either provide the documentation proving their accuracy or, in the 
event that we have made an error, retract them.</p>

<p>We have long acknowledged that the W.S.A. was the A.I.T.'s U.S. 
section, even if we would have preferred that the International exercise 
greater caution in admitting new sections. The <i>Libertarian Labor 
Review</i> does not dispute the fact that W.S.A. is a section of the 
A.I.T. For example, in LLR issue #7, page 2 (Editorial), we specifically 
referred to WSA as "the IWA's affiliate in the U.S."</p>
    
<p>Finally, although we exchange publications with some A.I.T. sections' 
newspapers, we are not aware of any "formal relations" between our 
collective and the A.I.T. or its sections. As an independent 
anarcho-syndicalist magazine, we have never attempted to enter into formal 
relations with the A.I.T.</p>
    
<p>We trust that this will clarify the latter two points, and that you 
will advise us as to what "unjustified attacks" we might have made against 
the W.S.A. While we have serious political differences with that 
organization, we would not wish to level any unproven accusations against 
them.</blockquote>

<center><p>Anarcho-syndicalist Greetings,
<br>the <i>Libertarian Labor Review</i> Collective.</p></center>

<p>One final note: As we go to press we have not received a response from 
the Secrtariat. Nor are we sure what the practical consequences of being 
"banned" will be. Nevertheless, this episode should demonstrate to 
anarcho-syndicalists in the U.S. the W.S.A.'s sectarian nature and their 
hypocrisy when they claim to be "pluralistic" and to want "open 
discussion." It is unfortunate that the IWA/AIT has allowed itself to be 
dragged into the middle of this disupte. It would be better to make WSA 
fight its own battles, rather than allow them to use their AIT affiliation 
as a gag to silence their critics.</p>
