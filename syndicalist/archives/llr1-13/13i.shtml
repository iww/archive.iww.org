<p class="blackbar">Bakunin and the Historians</p>

<p>"Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin, the anarchist, was a political thinker; 
his reputation, based partly on his appetite for action and partly on 
unsympathetic historiography, obscures this..." Robert Cutler opens the 
introduction to his anthology of Bakunin's writings with these words. 
Another historian, Nunzio Pernicone, deplores the modern fashion of 
"Bakunin-bashing." And Arthur Lehning, in a 1978 review of the historical 
literature, refers to a conspiracy of silence, suggesting that studying 
Bakunin inevitably raises basic questions confronting working-class 
movements - dictatorship vs. liberty, centralism vs. federalism, 
self-organization vs. a domineering political party.</p>

<p>When Lehning wrote, only the Marxist E.H. Carr's 1937 biography was 
available in English (aside from historical sketches in pamphlets, 
journals, and collections of Bakunin's work) and few of Bakunin's writings 
had been translated into English. But today a substantial number of 
biographical works, at least compared to the paucity of Bakunin's own 
writings, are available in English. In addition to E.H. Carr's dated but 
still standard biography, reissued in 1975, readers have been subjected to 
two popular biographies (Masters, Mendel), a new scholarly biography by 
Aileen Kelly, a very useful look at Bakunin's pivotal role in organizing 
the Italian socialist movement (Ravindranathan), and Thomas' rather 
intriguing examination of the way in which Marx borrowed his ideas from, 
and shaped his arguments in response to, anarchist thinkers including 
Bakunin and Proudhon.</p>

<p>Masters', Mendel's and Kelly's biographies are quite poor, especially 
when compared to Carr. Mendel argues (unconvincingly, and on the basis of 
remarkably few sources) that Bakunin's revolutionary career and ideas were 
fundamentally authoritarian and resulted from deep-seated psychological 
problems. Masters is friendlier to his subject (but sees anarchism as at 
best a beautiful but impractical dream), but draws almost entirely upon 
English-language sources, especially Carr, and is written more in the 
style of a novel than a work of history.</p>

<p>Aileen Kelly's biography, the newest of the three, purports to be an 
intellectual biography but (in Cutler's words) "treats Bakunin as a case 
study in the social psychology of millenarianism" (p. 234). Kelly is 
unabashedly hostile, painting Bakunin as an ill- meaning buffoon, 
misrepresenting key aspects of his life and thought, and disguising 
missing evidence with circular footnotes. Although historians of Spanish 
(Esenwein) and Italian (Ravindranathan) anarchism point to the 
organizational and propagandistic skills Bakunin displayed in those 
settings, Kelly refuses to allow the historical record to stand in the way 
of her thesis.</p>

<p>Ravindranathan, however, has written an outstanding book focussing on 
one of Bakunin's most productive efforts during his ten years or so as an 
anarchist (for most of his revolutionary career, Bakunin was a 
pan-Slavist). Bakunin played a key role in disabusing the nascent Italian 
revolutionaries of patriotic illusions, and persuaded them that a social, 
not merely a political, revolution was necessary. As the American 
Historical Review's (Dec. 1990, pp. 1576-77) reviewer put it, "Thankfully, 
Ravindranathan does not indulge in the Bakunin-bashing that has become so 
fashionable in recent years. Although he does not hesitate to note 
[indeed, to exaggerate-jb] the Russian's ideological inconsistencies and 
personal failings, Ravindranathan portrays Bakunin as a serious and 
devoted revolutionary, an acute thinker capable of extraordinary 
insights... and a master propagandist."</p>

<p>Kelly and Mendel attribute responsibility for Nechaev's Catechism to 
Bakunin, even though it has been proven that Bakunin not only did not 
write it, but vigorously denounced it. (Carr, writing before the evidence 
was in, makes the same argument on the basis of stylistic similarities and 
turns of phrase, apparently never considering the fact that authors borrow 
from, and are influenced by, one another. Avrich's collection of Anarchist 
Portraits contains an essay reviewing the evidence on this, and another 
which attacks Bakunin on scant evidence indeed.) Aside from Carr, the 
biographies focus their attention on Bakunin's pre- anarchist period, 
whether because it was the greater part of his life (though it is his 
anarchist years for which Bakunin is best remembered, and that account for 
the continuing historical interest) or because it enables biographers to 
indulge in their pet theories about why Bakunin turned out so badly.</p>

<p>And make no mistake about it, in the eyes of his biographers (at least 
his English-language biographers) Bakunin turned out very badly indeed. 
For Carr, Bakunin is a tragic-comic figure, albeit very human. Masters 
suggests a greater degree of grandeur in his rewriting of Carr's work. For 
Mendel, Bakunin is a villain of the highest order, with an egomaniacal 
will to dominate and to destroy. Kelly softens this portrait somewhat, 
leaving Bakunin quite inscrutable. For if he were truly the ineffectual 
buffoon she describes, he would surely have long since passed into 
obscurity.</p>

<p>Readers interested in learning the details of Bakunin's life would do 
better to look at Guillaume's highly partisan account, which opens 
Dolgoff's anthology, or Shatz's briefer biographical sketch in the 
Introduction to his edition of Statism and Anarchy. While Carr is by no 
means friendly to anarchism, his account too is worth reading. But 
Ravindranathan's account, while covering Bakunin's life from 1814 through 
1863 (Bakunin moved to Italy in 1864) in just 16 pages, offers the best 
book-length English- language biography, covering the years when Bakunin 
developed and began to propagate his anarchist ideas. Despite its focus on 
Italy, Bakunin & The Italians illustrates both Bakunin's methods and his 
ideas during this vital period (Bakunin retired in ill health in 1874, his 
final two years receive little attention).</p>

<p>In order to read Bakunin himself, one still often needs to be 
proficient in French or Russian (preferably both), but there are now four 
widely-available English-language anthologies of Bakunin's writings 
(Dolgoff, Cutler, Lehning and Maximoff), alongside the long-available God 
and the State (published by Dover in 1970) and Marshall Shatz's new 
translation of Statism and Anarchy - one of Bakunin's few more-or-less 
completed books, and his last major theoretical work. (An earlier 
translation of Statism and Anarchy by C.H. Plummer was published in 1976 
by the Revisionist Press. I have been unable to locate a copy, but it is 
reputedly much inferior.) Also available in English is an annotated 
edition of The Confession of Mikhail Bakunin (written from a Russian 
prison), and excerpts in several anthologies and pamphlets.</p>

<p>These translations and anthologies fall into two broad categories: 
scholarly editions (Cutler, Shatz), and more popular translations 
(Dolgoff, Maximoff; Lehning falls somewhere in between) intended to 
present Bakunin's ideas to contemporary readers. The popular editions 
often delete references to often obscure controversies or persons Bakunin 
was responding to and seek to simplify his often difficult prose in order 
to make it more accessible to modern readers. The resulting works are 
generally more readable than are their scholarly counterparts, though some 
readers prefer (or need) the deleted material in order to place Bakunin's 
writings in their specific, historical context, which often shaped not 
only the concerns addressed but also the form they took.</p>

<p>Dolgoff's anthology is the most useful and comprehensive, although 
Cutler has unearthed several interesting texts. Maximoff is useful 
primarily as a concordance - he has organized very brief excerpts by 
subject, in order to enable readers to readily ascertain, say, Bakunin's 
views on human nature. But while translators such as Cutler and Schatz 
tend to present Bakunin's writings as historical artifacts, Dolgoff sets 
out to illustrate the basic themes of Bakunin's anarchist philosophy, and 
has carefully selected his texts "in order to enable the reader to grasp 
the essence of Bakunin's views" (p. 21).</p>

<p>(For readers interested in comparing different translations, Cutler 
[pp. 32-33] provides a useful list of the editions and pages upon which 
other English-language translations of the same works can be found. 
Similarly, compare Dolgoff's 25 pages of excerpts from Statism and Anarchy 
to Shatz's 218 page translation. Dolgoff extracts the core of Bakunin's 
devastating critique of Marxism and his discussion of the preconditions 
for social revolution; while it is certainly useful to have the complete 
work available, it is largely devoted to a detailed analysis of 
contemporary political currents which adds relatively little - with some 
exceptions, most notably the "Appendix" and its discussion of 
revolutionary strategy - to our understanding of Bakunin's 
philosophy.)</p>

<p>Sadly, many anarchists know little more of Bakunin than a few aphorisms 
(the urge to destroy is also a creative urge, "I shall continue to be an 
impossible person so long as those who are now possible remain possible") 
and perhaps a general sense of his critique of, and battle against, 
Marxism. For example, a writer in The Raven recently argued, on the basis 
of her reading of God and the State, that Bakunin was uninterested in the 
liberation of women. Clearly she was unfamiliar with Bakunin's "Manifesto 
of the Russian Revolutionary Association to the Oppressed Women of Russia" 
(excerpted in Dolgoff), of his defense of his sister's right to escape a 
love-less marriage, etc. Similarly, recent writers in the anarchist press 
have attributed a wide variety of conflicting economic views to Bakunin. 
Without doubt, Bakunin had many faults and inconsistencies - even during 
the years when he was developing anarchism as a political philosophy. But 
he played a vital role in the evolution of our movement and our ideas, and 
deserves to be better, and more accurately, remembered.</p>
