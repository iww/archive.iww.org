<p class="redbar">Baseball Assailed for Using Sweatshops</p>
<p><b>By Diana Nelson Jones - <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>, Saturday,
October 16, 2004</b></p>
<p><img src="../../../../graphics/labor/seamtrs.gif" align="right" />A champion of
sweatshop workers in the developing world, Kenneth Miller has spent the
past three baseball seasons rattling consumers' consciences outside PNC
Park.</p>
<p> Those bobblehead dolls the fans clamor for, and a variety of other
sports-related gee-gaws and apparel, are made in overseas sweatshops,
according to Miller and other workers' advocates, including the National
Labor Committee.</p>
<p> The Pirates don't decide which factories will make the merchandise it
sells. Major League Baseball hires companies to produce it for 30 teams.
Those companies, such as Nike, New Era and Rawlings, contract with
factories.</p>
<p> But Miller, a member of Industrial Workers of the World, says the
Pirates are complicit as beneficiaries of revenue and should bring
pressure on Major League Baseball. His local alliance is targeting the
Pirates directly because, he said, "They are the ones who should care the
most what their fans think."</p>
<p> The Pittsburgh Anti-Sweatshop Community Alliance -- under the motto
"No Sweatshops Bucco!" -- will present a forum today at Duquesne
University to spotlight the 30-year fight of garment workers in Bangladesh
to get a union, improve conditions at the plant and keep it from moving to
China. The forum is open to the public from 2 to 4 p.m. in Pappert Hall,
followed by a rally at Centre Avenue and Crawford Street.</p>
<p> Miller said he doesn't know whose apparel these workers make, but it's
all the same in the big picture, which he calls "this nasty situation of
human rights abuses."</p>
<p> The Pirates front office insists it passes alliance communications on
to Major League Baseball. Patty Paytas, a spokesman for the team, said MLB
"is very responsive, absolutely," to these notifications of displeasure.
She added, "The Pirates absolutely have a conscience. The amount of work
we do in the community should prove that."</p>
<p> For Miller's efforts on the sidewalks outside PNC Park, there is no
evidence Pirates fans have rallied to the workers' cause.</p> <p> He
conceded that when he tells fans that, for instance, Chuck Tanner figurine
dolls were made by Chinese workers forced to work 20-plus hour shifts,
fans say, "Why are you trying to interrupt our nice day at the
ballpark?"</p>
<p> To be sure, the issue reaches beyond baseball. Earlier this year, the
National Labor Committee went after the NBA for dealing with apparel
factories in repressive Burma, violating its own rules of business.</p>
<p> It also reaches far beyond sport. Some of the most popular name-brand
retailers have for years been called to task for conditions in plants that
make their products.</p>
<p> Earlier this year, the Gap was lauded by labor organizations for
making public conditions at factories that manufacture its clothes, which
include Banana Republic and Old Navy labels. Gap ended associations with
more than 100 factories, but that decision highlights another side of
scrutiny: Instead of improving conditions, it can prompt loss of jobs in
already abject economies.</p>
<p> Perhaps the most memorable sweatshop news, in 1996, was when Charles
Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, exposed conditions in
a Honduran factory that produced Kathy Lee Gifford's line of clothing for
Wal-Mart, making the TV personality cry in humiliation.</p>
<p> Baseball is an easy target because it licenses more merchandise than
any other professional sport and, says Kernaghan, is "one of the worst for
having no labor-rights standards."</p>
<p> Howard Smith, Major League Baseball's vice president for consumer
products, counters: "I can assure you there is no company we do business
with that knowingly goes into a factory with sub-par working
conditions."</p>
<p> He said teams make their own arrangements for items they give away,
such as Chuck Tanner figurines, Willie Stargell bobbleheads, keychains.
They buy from middlemen, not manufacturers. "But I can assure you, knowing
my clubs pretty well, if we find out these [sweatshop-made] allegations
are true, the Pirates won't be doing business with them anymore.</p>
<p> "If we find out about it, we will make changes."</p>
<p> According Kernaghan, there's a lot for Major League Baseball to find
out about.</p>
<p> Kernaghan cited a factory in Turrialba, Costa Rica, with which
Rawlings contracts for the manufacture of baseballs. Rawlings supplies all
the baseballs to Major League Baseball, and this factory's conditions were
the focus of a New York Times story last January. Smith said allegations
against Rawlings' factory prompted Commissioner Bud Selig to telephone
Smith and say, " 'Get down there and check it out.'</p>
<p> "I talked to nearly every employee," said Smith. "Not only are the
allegations false, these employees are paid above the country's average
wage."</p>
<p> The Times story cited one worker's $55 a week as "slighly above the
country's minimum wage."</p>
<p> Rawlings President Robert Parish said workers in Turrialba earn "at
least 14 percent above the government-established minimum wage rate, with
many of our workers earning incentive payments beyond that."</p>
<p> He said the workers get nine paid holidays and two weeks of vacation
per year, and that Rawlings makes retirement contributions, offers
four-months of maternity leave and medical services.</p>
<p> Smith said workers told him the job of sewing the hide on the
baseballs was the most sought-after job, but it's the job cited as the
most injurious.</p>
<p> Kernaghan's labor committee investigators interviewed the Turrialba
workers off site, "where people could talk without retribution." He said a
majority of the workers who sew reported suffering repetitive stress
disorders that are not addressed by the factory owners. "They sew 156
balls a day, one every 15 minutes. One stitch every 8.3 seconds. They get
paid approximately 28 cents per ball. Of course workers want those jobs.
They are showing up at 6 in morning and working until 6 at night because
they desperately need the money.</p>
<p> "They told me. They wouldn't stay in those rotten jobs if they had any
other options."</p>
