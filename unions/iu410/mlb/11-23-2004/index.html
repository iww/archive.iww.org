<p><b>Michelle Burton Brown - November 2004</b></p>
<p>Members of the Bagladesh Center for Worker's Solidarity (BCWS), along
with representatives from the National Labor Committee, (NLC) met recently
in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to bring attention to work conditions in
developing countries. The Bangladeshi garment workers spoke at Duquesne
University and then marched, along with supporters, to Freedom Corner, a
historic civil rights landmark and rallying place in Pittsburgh's
African-American Hill District.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is a South Asian country that once formed part of Pakistan.
The country gained independence in 1971, after a nine-month civil war
between East Pakistan and West Pakistan. In 1991 and 1996, despite
on-going political upheaval and corruption, Bangladeshi voters elected two
female Prime Ministers into office. The Republic of Bangladesh developed
its apparel <a name="cont">industry</a> as a direct result of the
Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA). International trade in textiles and apparel
is governed by the MFA. The agreement was designed as a short-term measure
to give industrialized countries time to adjust to competition from
developing countries. The agreement created Free Trade Zones by
eliminating import/export taxes on fabric and finished apparel for major
labels and retailers in the United States and Canada. In Free Trade Zones,
factory owners are not required to pay taxes or adhere to minimum wage
requirements. Twelve-hour shifts are common and trade unions illegal.
Clothing is the main export of Bangladesh and accounts for more than half
of the countries export income.</p>
<p>Two speakers at the Pittsburgh Forum, Robina Akther and Ms.Maksuda are
approximately 18 years of age. There are no birth certificates in
Bangladesh so many people are unsure of their exact age. Maksuda began
working in garment factories when she was 11 years old. Robina has worked
in factories for the last two years. The women say that they cannot afford
basic necessities. They say they are unable to buy milk, meat, vegetables
or fruit. Their diet consists of mainly rice and lentils and they are
unable to purchase supplemental vitamins for themselves or their children.
Ms. Maksuda was seven months pregnant and working in the factory when she
began to feel sick and had to stop working to wait for the nausea to pass.
The manager saw that she was not working and told her to get back to work
because she had a quota to meet. Ms.Maksuda asked if she could rest a few
moments. She called the manager's attention to the fact that she was seven
months pregnant. The manager said her pregnancy was not his concern and
before she could protec or defendt herself, the manger kicked her in the
stomach and she fell to the factory floor. "I felt my baby shift in my
stomach when he kicked me," Ms.Maksuda told the audience through an
interpreter.</p>
<p>Despite harsh opposition, garment workers in Bangladesh have had some
success unionizing. Workers shut down production on May Day in 2001,
winning their first paid holiday. In July of 2004, through strikes and
publicity, workers won an unprecedented four-weeks paid maternity leave.
Increasing public awareness of sweat shop conditions in developing
countries have led to the creation of coalitions and alliances among
clergy, universities, union leaders and activists. The Coalition of Labor
Union Women (CLUW), the largest organization of union women in the United
States, pledged to support anti-sweatshop campaigns and initiatives as
priority action issues. Sweat Free Communities, a network for action
against sweatshops, issued the following statement on their website:</p>
<blockquote>Most clothing and footwear sold in this country are made under
highly abusive conditions in factories that can only be described as
sweatshops. Workers in these factories earn poverty wages for long hours
of work while being denied the right to freely form or join unions.
Apparel workers in the U.S. also face sweatshop conditions, as do workers
in an increasing number of manufacturing and service
industries.</blockquote>
<p>In Pennsylvania and across the United States, hundreds of thousands of
garment workers stand to lose their jobs if the majority of apparel
assembly is exported to other countries. In an effort to address growing
concerns over the exploitation of garment workers and the impending loss
of industry, Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell signed an executive
order to aid garment workers in Pennsylvania and elsewhere by ensuring
that Commonwealth agencies do not procure uniforms and apparel from
sweatshops. UNITE, one of the nations largest apparel and textile unions,
view the governor's decision as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>"I applaud Governor Rendell's strong stand in support of workers
rights," said Lynne Fox, UNITE Vice President and Manager of the
Philadelphia Joint Board. "This executive order will help Pennsylvania's
economy by giving the many responsible factories in our state a fair
chance to compete for Commonwealth contracts, without being undercut by
sweatshops where workers are abused." New York, California, New Jersey and
Maine passed similar anti-sweatshop legislation.</p>
<p>During the Uruguay Round negotiations with the World Trade Organization
(WTO), an agreement was reached to phase out the MFA through the
implementation of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). A
timetable was set for phasing out the MFA beginning in January 1995, with
full phase out by January 2005. Friends of the Earth International, an
advocacy organization that opposes the negative effects of the global free
trade system, predicts that, once quotas are removed, Bangladesh is
expected to suffer from its lack of textile industry and poorly developed
infrastructure. Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Philippines may also lose
since all three depend on imported fabric and on marketing/buying groups
over which they have little control. The impact of the MFA phase-out is
likely to result in loss of employment. If countries like Bangladesh are
no longer able to compete in an open market, factories will shut down and
re-open elsewhere.</p>
<p>Under Pennsylvania's executive order, bidders on Commonwealth apparel
contracts are required to meet anti-sweatshop standards in order to do
business with the Commonwealth. The executive order applies to the
manufacturing and laundering of uniforms and apparel contracted by
Commonwealth executive agencies.
Pittsburgh Anti-Sweatshop Community Alliance (PASCA), cofounder Kenneth
Miller, told <i>Women's Independent Press</i>:</p>
<blockquote>City and state laws that demand wage disclosure from all
apparel manufactures can create a strong response to Multi-Fiber
expiration from citizens of Western Pennsylvania. The people of this
region have high standards for women's rights and civil
rights.</blockquote>
<p>Celeste Taylor, PASCA organizer and NAACP co ordinator, expanded upon
PASCA's stand on wage disclosure:</p>
<blockquote>In PASCA's disclosure demand we want to know where these
factories are and how much the workers are being paid. It is probably the
case that the workers are not receiving pay stubs with their checks. They
don't know what they are being paid per hour. Nor do they know what they
are being paid for overtime or what deductions are being taken from their
paychecks. PASCA is demanding certified payroll for the workers in
developing countries who sew apparel for the Pittsburgh Pirates. We cannot
have Pirate Gear sewn by workers who are denied their own basic wage
information. </blockquote>
<p>Being denied basic wage information is only the tip of the iceberg
according to War on Want, an international organization that fights
poverty in developing countries affected by globalization. War on Want
General Secretary, Amirul Haque Amin, blames Multi-National Corporations
for the conditions in Bangladesh:</p>
<blockquote>Multi-national corporations (MNCs) are responsible for these
bad conditions. MNC's sell Bangladesh T-shirts for $20 to $25 in USA or
other developed countries, but they buy these T-shirt from Bangladesh at
just $2. International companies sell Bandladesh denim shirts for $30 to
$40 in USA or other developed countries, but they buy these shirts from
Bangladesh for only $4 or $5. This is not fair trade or a fair price. This
unfair and unjustified trade of international companies is responsible for
the bad conditions of the Bangladeshi garment workers.</blockquote>
<p>Charles Kernaghan, Executive Director of the National Labor Committee,
is traveled across the United States with the Bangladeshi garment
workers. Kernaghan condemns U.S. corporations that exploit workers in
developing countries.</p>
<blockquote>Wal-Mart is the largest company in the world. Wal-Mart's
annual revenues are $258.7 billion dollars. What many people don't know is
that Wal-Mart is also the largest sweatshop abuser in the world. When
Wal-Mart advertises with that little bouncing ball that they are going to
Roll Back Prices, what Wal-Mart is really doing is slashing wages and
benefits and rolling back respect for women's, workers' and human rights
all across the developing world. Wal-Mart is pitting workers across the
world against each other, competing over who will accept the least pay and
benefits and the most miserable living and working conditions. Workers in
Bangladesh sewing Wal-Mart garments are earning just 13 to 17 cents an
hour, leaving the workers and their families trapped in utter
misery.</blockquote>
<p>Educational opportunities are practically non-existent. Most of the
workers drop out of school at an early age to help support their families.
The women work 12 to15 hours per day. There is no time to pursue an
education.</p>
<p>Duquesne University professor and PASCA organizer, Michelle Gaffey,
called on Governor Rendell and the city of Pittsburgh to enforce sweatshop
legislation: </p>
<blockquote>The state of Pennsylvania and the city of Pittsburgh have both
passed anti-sweatshop purchasing legislation that remains un-enforced.
Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University are members of the
Workers Right Consortium affiliation campaigns in the area. The members of
PASCA have been talking to baseball fans and urging the Pittsburgh Pirates
Baseball Club to help us lead the Major League sports industry in sweat
free initiatives.</blockquote>
<p>The goal of organizers is to connect efforts to end exploitation of
garment workers in developing countries to the exploitation of workers in
other countries. Mongezi Nkomo, South African native and founder of Azania
Heritage International, the sponsoring organization for PASCA, said, "The
anti-sweatshop movement in the USA, Africa, Asia and Latin America is a
part of the global human rights movement for democratic freedom, economic
justice and social peace in an era of global neo-liberalism---where the
primary agenda is corporate greed for private profit at the expense of the
majority of the human race." </p>
<p>Before leaving Pittsburgh for Boston Sheikh Nazma, president of
Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity and former factory worker, told
supports at Freedom Corner: </p>
<blockquote>We seek your support to win worker's rights. All we want is
one day a week off. No physical abuse in the factories. Overtime pay and
maternity leave. We want to be treated with dignity and like human beings.
