<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p><b>I wrote this and published it in the <i>Redwood Ripsaw</i>
of Davenport, California last year (1965).</b></p>
<p>The Bolshevik Revolution in "Mother Russia" in November 1917
came like the thunder clap of the Atom Bomb. It caught the
workers of all the world by complete surprise-and it dumfounded
the master class as well.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/marxism/leninrea.jpg" align="right" border="1" />I was only age 18 and was setting chokers at the
time in a logging camp in Oregon, the camp of the "Siletz Lumber
and logging company, and I was of course, a confirmed IWW
(Wobbly). I listened to furious arguments among the IWW crew
members, and they were split right down the middle as to the
nature of what really went on in old Russia. The great works of
Lenin were yet to be circulated in the US so quite naturally, we
were in the dark as far as authentic information was concerned.
Oh yes, the bosses newspapers were full of news about "That Red
Butcher, Lenin", but us Wobblies knew from sad past experience
about the authenticity of such sources.</p>
<a id="1" name="1"></a>
<p>In the meantime the IWW started a decline after the Russian
Evolution, and the split widened on the question of political
action. In the early 20s the split was finalized and for a time
there were two groups, each claiming to be the real IWW. Workers
were quitting the organization right and left and the political
action wing finally wound up in the new American Communist Party.
By 1923 I was out of the IWW and was in NOTHING until 1928 when I
ran into Bill Foster's TUUL in the form of the National Lumber
Workers Union. I found therein scores of my former "Fellow
Workers" of the Wobblies. This union was affiliated with the
RILU, which was the "Red International of Labor Unions.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[1]</a></p>
<a id="2" name="2"></a>
<p>At one meeting in Seattle we were electing a delegate from the
Washington Lumber Locals to attend this RILU which was to meet in
the Moscow, USSR. I had inquired around and found that they
ALWAYS met in Moscow or Leningrad.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[2]</a></p>
<p>I raised a point of information from the floor as to "why we
always had to meet in Russia, and why not a New York conference
some time?" This of course brought a big horse laugh from most of
the guys and the chairman then explained that in such a case the
International delegates from Russia, France, Germany, Poland,
England, etc would be promptly thrown into the bucket and
deported! So much for "Free Democratic America!"</p>
<p>I went to work in the new union side by side with members of
the then new Communist Party and found them to be the best union
men I had ever seen. This pretty much sold me on the Communist
Party, so I joined them in 1929. We are all aware of what
happened in 1929-and the Communist Party certainly didn't cause
that depression! What they DID do was to organize some three
million American workers into a huge employment organization.
Also we raised such a fuss thru unemployed demonstrations that
the much despised Communist Party DID get unemployment
compensation, they DID get Social Security. They DID get aid to
dependent children. These measures did not come automatically,
they came into being by way of a hard struggle-led by the
Communist Party!</p>
<a id="3" name="3"></a>
<p>This much despised party also played a leading role in the
organization of the big CIO unions in auto, steal, lumber,
rubber, longshore, electrical, and mine, mill, and smelter
industries.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[3]</a> Regardless of what the
communist haters say-I've "seen the movie and read the book" as
the saying goes. Many an American family survived the depression
ONLY, and yes, ONLY because of the Communist activity that was
struggling against great odds, AGAINST public apathy, and against
the big wheels in both major parties.</p>
<p>We took the lead in the anti-war and anti-fascist movements of
the day. We picketed scarp iron going to Japan. We fought
actively against evictions. I was jailed as the result of
picketing scrap iron going to Japan, and jailed because of
picketing in the agricultural strike when the pay was ten cents
per hour, and we asked for 35 cents per. [I] was also jailed
because of participating in the demonstrations against war and
fascism.</p>
<p>Now: If you are a worker, ask yourself, "which side SHOULD I
have been on? Should I have laid still for ten cents per hour and
let my family starve? When you see a family being evicted into
the street, would you help the family, or would you help the
"law" to evict them?</p>
<p>I see nothing horrendous at all about Communism. It is merely
a system of Public ownership of the factories, mines, mills,
power, telegraph, etc. Under PIVATE ownership we are forever
having depressions or wars. People CAN function in co-ops, and
they surely DO co-operate in baseball teams. Why not in industry?
We boast about our private enterprise economy, but a public
enterprise economy possibly would have done much better. Anyway,
most Americans are convinced that the world Communist movement is
a flat failure-so why all the worry about it?</p>
<p>One thing that is for sure: the Communist movement is being
led by the most oppressed and exploited sections of the populace.
So: to the Communist haters I would say, "get busy and fight
against war. Fight against poverty and insecurity. These are the
breeding grounds of Communism."</p>
<p>If the so-called "Free World" can produce a better and more
secure living standard for these "most oppressed" sections of the
populace-then there is absolutely nothing to worry about. If they
can't do this, then they properly should worry, and do you know
something? They ARE worried and with good reason.</p>
<a id="4" name="4"></a>
<p>In "prosperous" US some 2% of the populace control some 98% of
the wealth.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[4]</a> Such is the "Free" World. The
big wheels, naturally want freedom. Freedom to ride roughshod
over the working class. "Freedom" to exploit the workers in Latin
America, Africa, and Asia.</p>
<a id="5" name="5"></a>
<p>While I had joined the "party" in 1929, by 1936 I was having
some second thoughts about it. They were more and more becoming a
mere appendage of the "establishment". They were beginning to
support "progressive" candidates in both old parties. They began
to worship the "great Roosevelt-AFTER THEY MADE HIM INSTITUTE
Unemployment Compensation, Social Security, and the like. This
was NOT a revolutionary position, and I objected to this policy.
I believed in Socialism-not "reformed" Capitalism. However the
revisionists of Marxist-Leninism had their way, and the decline
of the Communist Party had begun. From a peak of over 100,000
members it has declined today, in 1966 to less than 5,000.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[5]</a></p>
<a id="6" name="6"></a>
<p>The first bad mistake was the setting up of a dual Federation
of Labor, the TUUL.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[6]</a> This was contrary to
the teaching of Lenin. This move removed the militants from the
AFL thereby making certain the continued rule of well known
"labor fakirs" within that federation. Then came 1935, the year
of the lumber strike.</p>
<p>The "Party" had dissolved the TUUL by that time and it was a
worse mistake to dissolve it at that time than it was to set it
up in the 1920s. By that time, 1935, the industrial workers were
screaming for an industrial union federation, which later led to
the organization of the CIO.</p>
<a id="7" name="7"></a>
<p>After the dissolving of the National Lumber Workers Union of
the TUUL the Party instructed us to join the big "Lumber and
Sawmill Workers Union." AFL-which we did. We were then instructed
to "gain rank-and-file control of this union. We were able to do
this by exposing the sell-out of the leadership in that strike.
Rank and File rule prevailed so the Carpenters (the Parent Union)
simply jerked the charters of most locals in Washington, Oregon,
and some in Canada. Now, had we retained our rank-and-file dyed
in the wool National Labor Union the history of the lumberjacks
since 1935 would be entirely different. Next, the Party
instructed us to set up a new union of lumber workers-which we
did. It was the International Woodworkers of America, CIO.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Communist Party led this union for the most part for a
time. Then came ANOTHER fatal blow from the revisionist party
leadership under Earl Browder. That decision came in 1937. It was
to "dissolve the party fraction." Still later came the Browder
decision to dissolve the party itself! Due to the many phoney
decisions of the party leadership the influences of the party
continued to decline. Came the build-up for World War Two,
business picked up, business UNIONISM prevailed, and the present
phoney "prosperity" began. Time will of course "take care" of
this false prosperity with another world shaking depression which
is on the way. Then begins ANOTHER chapter of militant struggle
on the part of the American working class.</p>
<a id="8" name="8"></a>
<p>Within my lifetime as a lumberjack, I saw the rise and then
the decline of the IWW and the Communist Party. Both of these
organizations, (in spite of their mistakes) did much to improve
the lot of the lumberjack. By 1917 loggers had the highest pay
rate of any other industrial workers, due to the IWW struggles.
What's holding up improvements in the lot of lumberjacks today is
the fact that there are two competing unions in the industry, and
the fact that there are over a million woodworkers-and only a bit
over 150,000 organized! This is why common labor in construction
for instance, gets about $3,72 per hour with common labor in
lumber receiving from Federal minimum wage to $2.50 per hour.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[8]</a></p>
<p>I remained in the Communist Party until 1945, until "rear
ending the Democratic donkey" got [to be] too much for me. In
1948 I was for a time a member of the "West Coast Committee to
re-construct the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party" until it
failed because it simply was not historically timed.</p>
<p>After the failure of the "West Coast Committee" in 1949. I was
out of the revolutionary movement and held membership only in
both lumber unions. This period lasted until 1957 when I wound up
at Fort Seward, Humboldt County, California. The experiences
there come in a later portion of this book.</p>
<a id="9" name="9"></a>
<p>Now for a few personal notes we will go back to 1927 when I
was a scaler and log deck man in a Columbia River sawmill. I got
married at that time. Later in the same year the mill went
bankrupt, so I wound up at Buster Creek on the Columbia River
bucking logs. That was the first time I had read a <i>Daily
Worker</i>, official organ of the Communist Party.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#note">[9]</a> It was illegal at that time and was printed
on thin onion skin paper and mailed out in a long envelope. It
was printed in Chicago. This issue, (in 1927) carried an article
by Joe Stalin telling how the whole Capitalist world was in for a
very severe economic crisis. Two years later this came about, and
how!</p>
<p>After Buster Creek shut down , I wound up on a "splash drive"
on Wind River, near Carson, Washington. When that was done got on
the first log drive on the Clearwater River for the Potlatch
Lumber Company of Lewiston Idaho. (This is my last experience as
a river pig.) On this drive I met many former river pigs that I
knew from Minnesota. Came 1929 and I was spare setter and dogger
at Snoqualamie Falls, Washington, east of Seattle-and then came
the "Hoover Boom." The world went to hell, or so it seemed, with
seventeen million unemployed in 1932. Followed a lot of
"Bullwash" about how the country was "over-populated"-and now
with the approach of another Hoover Boom, we are hearing the same
old baloney! (1966)</p>
<p>The depression years, I hate to remember. From 1930 until 1937
I was on and off of WPA. A logging camp job would open and they
would put on only a rigging crew, deck logs at a spar tree, then
after a week, shut down, lay off the rigging crew, put on a
loading crew and load out-as they had orders. So-back to town,
apply for WPA-get turned down because of too many ahead of
you-get a committee and go after the welfare set-up. Stay on
until a job opened, and repeat the process. (Three cheers for the
Private Enterprise System!)</p>
<p>During this time there were anti-eviction fights, unemployed
demonstrations demanding "Unemployment Compensation." "We demand
Social Security." "Down with war and Fascism." "boycott the
aggressors," and the like. There were periods in jail, a time to
get beat up for being so brash as to want to live. A period that
saw a tremendous glut of everything on the market-and a period
when the 17 million unemployed and millions of poor farmers,
millions of part time workers, and millions of small business men
could buy nothing! Widespread starvation-in the midst of plenty.
If you were in that category, which side would you choose? The
Communists who were advocating change, or the Big Hoosiers who
were against change?? I, for one, made my choice and it was
Communism! No rich, no poor, a workers' commonwealth. Let the
"brainy ones" and the greedy guts compete all they want to in
sports, literature, and the arts-but let the bread and butter
alone! Let THAT be the business of the commonwealth Those were my
sentiments in 1914-and they still are today.</p>
<p>In 1937 I heard of a few pine outfits starting up in eastern
Washington around Chelan. Threw the cork shoes in the old Model
T. Pack what clothes you need, drive over and have a look. ONE
good thing was that the wife and kids would get my $1.20 per week
ration. That's what it was: $1.20 per week per person! SO: you
take off in a cloud of smoke with the old T Model, no license, no
drivers license, no lights, no brake pedal, and no money. I wound
up in a logging camp near Pateros, Washington, above Chelan and
got on falling and bucking pine and piling brush for a small
apple box outfit. [I] worked a few months and moved over
there.</p>
<p>Second year there and the Comrade Wife died with a strep
throat. I have at that time, four children, youngest, a girl aged
two, and the oldest of three boys aged 9. Hire house keepers.
Next it was rumored that a bunch of local women were seeking a
court order to take the children away from me as they deemed it
impossible for me to raise them. I thought otherwise, so I loaded
them up at night and drove them to Seattle, Washington, placed
them in a children's home so I could get them out "If and when".
The Real reason for the move on the part of the women was because
of my activity in trying to get the camp organize into the IWA
union CIO.</p>
<p>Hung around Seattle, cutting wood, carrying wood into
basements, logging when I could until 1939. Went to Bend, Oregon
"home" where Dad was still employed as an edgerman. No work
there, so [I] went to Sisters, Oregon. Arrived just in time to
see two men lead the dogger away. He had got his arm sliced with
the hook dog, so I got the job. He came back 10 days later but
the pond job was open so I got that and worked there four years.
They moved the mill to Redmond, Oregon and I worked three years
there. Had bought a lot and built a shack at Sisters, had got
married again and had the kids home and had a major share of
organizing the outfit into the International Woodworkers
Union.</p>
<p>Settled down to work at the new mill in Redmond and the boys
had elected me Vice President of the local as well as shop
steward, or "Jaw Smith" as the Wobblies called it. The following
might be called "mill town politics". The war was on by that
time, and the CIO had a policy of electing a PAC (Political
Action Committee) in all locals. The policy of the Communist
Party was similar, so I made the motion on the floor of one of
our meetings that a PAC be formed. It passes and a three man
committee was elected. I was one of them, so following the union
meeting, the new PAC met and decided to visit the AFL Carpenters
and AL Painters. They gave us floor time and we proposed a joint
effort-a combined PAC. Both Unions agreed, so we set up a thing
called the "Redmond Union Council". We tried to get the Grange in
but they declined. One of our members had the bright idea of
organizing a local of the "Farmers Union" and damned if we didn't
do that! (it's still in operation today in 1966). As most of the
new Farmers Union members were also Grangers, it was a simple
matter then to get them both affiliated into the Union Council.
The Union Council put up four candidates for City Council-and we
elected them all giving Redmond a pro-labor city Government that
pledged, among other things, city-financed post-war projects to
take up the slack in unemployment. The projects would pay Union
rates of pay.</p>
<p>After the election we tried to keep the Union Council going
but the Carpenters headquarters at Salem, Oregon forced the
withdrawal of the Carpenters from the Council. Same thing
happened with the Painters, though the rank-and-file pledged
continuing support. I was known as the "only Communist in town"
so the red-baiters didn't have a chance. I was also known as a
"damn good union man". Later on, some one turned the Redmond
Local in to the International, as "Communist dominated" and the
whole executive board came down from Portland to purge the local
of "Communists in official positions" in the local.</p>
<p>After a lot of red baiting speeches from the visiting
Brothers-to a cram packed local meeting, I offered to resign
official position in the union by a roaring voice vote they
refused to accept my resignation, and that was that. Every member
of that local knew I was the only Communist there! We had merged
with the Bend Local of IWA-CIO so on that same year (1944) I was
elected as delegate to their convention at Vancouver, BC. Later,
in same year was elected as delegate to State of Oregon CIO
convention at Roseburg, Oregon.</p>
<p>Of course, this political activity was coupled with economic
activity, or job action. We get the wages up, the hours down, we
defeated racism in the local, we got paid vacations plus fringe
benefits, but the employers-as usual-got the lion's share, as
they will continue to do until they are dispossessed. Labor has
created all, and this we must never forget. The more Communist
activity there is-the better conditions become for labor. This is
a simple fact of life: "It's the squeaky wheel that gets the
grease." The Wobblies had a good word for it: "To fan the flames
of discontent." To be contented is to INVITE wage cuts! So much
for "mill town politics".</p>
<p>My generation of "Timber Beasts" was the generation
historically slated to see the city of Cloquet, Minnesota lose
the title of "Lumber Capitol of the World". By 1914, Everett,
Washington had the title. I came from Cloquet, Minnesota to
Everett, Washington in 1916 the year of the "Verona Affair" when
some five members of the IWW were fired on and killed on the deck
of the tug Verona. There were 100 wounded. Why? They were coming
from Seattle, to Everett to "speak on the street" when free
speech was banned. There had been a joint strike by the Shingle
Weavers and the IWW. Martial law prevailed, so speech was banned.
The IWW and the Shingle Weavers finally prevailed and free speech
was restored. This was at a terrific cost with five men dead, and
over 100 wounded, plus nobody knows how many jailed, and for
what? Merely to enforce a constitutional provision guaranteeing
"freedom of speech"! So much for reliance on the Constitution, or
on anything else except on labor organization! Free Speech has
been muzzled many times in the US. But for the intervention of
the downtrodden as mentioned above, it is conceivable that
"Freedom of Speech, Press, and Assembly" could have been lost for
good and all time. "Eternal vigilance is the price"</p>
<p>Yes, it was old Thomas Jefferson, third President of US who
made that Statement, "Eternal Vigilance is the price of
Liberty."</p>
<p>The next "lumber Capitol" after Everett was Tacoma, then in
rapid succession, Gray's Harbor, Portland, Eugene, Roseburg, and
lastly and finally, Eureka &amp; Arcata California. I seen the
heyday of them all except Saginaw &amp; Bay City Michigan and
Bangor Maine.</p>
<p>While on the subject of the "Communist Era let us put in a
word or two about WHY communism? Why not "Democratic Socialism,
or "reformed Capitalism"? IN the first place there is no such
animal as Democratic Socialism. Socialism is the public ownership
of means of production. To the boss class and their lackeys, this
is NOT democratic, and they will have no part of it/ As to any
chance of "reforming" Capitalism, if you could so that it would
not be Capitalism! Why? Simply because Capital and Labor have
nothing in common. There is a continual struggle going on.
Capital wants Labor as cheap as it can be had. Labor, having only
their muscle to sell, wants all it can get. This struggle goes
on, either on picket lines, over [the] bargaining table, in the
courts, and on the job and it is not to be reconciled.</p>
<p>There will come a time in the affairs of Americans when Labor
MUST have more in order to exist, and at the same time private
capital will have to have more in order to keep going. At this
time unemployment will be rife. Possibly "rifer" than it ever was
before! This is the collision point! Isn't it reasonable to
assume that this will bring on the long-overdue Social
revolution? Isn't it also reasonable to assume that once the
forces of Labor are triumphant and they arrive in power that they
will set up their own "Dictatorship"? It will just mean that
Capitalist dictatorship will be replaced by Labor dictatorship,
which means that the MAJORITY will dictate to the MINORITY. This
Labor, or Communist Dictatorship will "wither away" after this
former boss class and their stooges get educated out of their
sticky fingered ways! This is my understanding of this horrible
thing called Communism!</p>

<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#1">[1]</a>Scribner is referring to William Z Foster,
a former IWW member who quit the organization in the 1910s due to
strategic differences with the IWW. Foster wrote a book called
Syndicalism which advocated that workers join the AFL and bore
from within. Later Foster became a Communist and moved steadily
rightward as he grew older. By the 1950s. Foster was solidly
pro-Capitalist and supported conservative trade union
bureaucrats. The IWW's refusal to align itself with the RILU is
discussed in chapter two.</p>

the AFL-CIO.</p>
<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner13a/#4">[4]</a> This figure is inaccurate. The figures in
the 1960s were closer to 5% of the populace controlling 40% of
the wealth, which is STILL an outrageous figure, but hardly what
Tom Scribner describes.</p>
