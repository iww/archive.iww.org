<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p><i>The following article was written by myself for the</i>
Forum <i>of Humboldt State in Arcata, California in 1960.</i></p>
<p>There has been a tremendous misunderstanding of Socialism in
the minds of people the world over due in part to a
misunderstanding of the meaning of the "Dictatorship of the
Proletariat". This has in turn given the Socialists of other
countries a "field day" so to speak, in competition with the
militant Leninist Communists, on the question of gaining
Socialism by means of peaceful Democratic persuasion rather than
by a forceful seizure of power, and then holding their gains by
the exercise of force.</p>
<p><a id="return" name="return"></a> A good example of this
"peaceful Democratic" brand of Socialism is, as it happened in
Germany. The German Kaiser was overthrown by the then Social
Democratic Party of Germany in 1918. Because of their failure to
impose a dictatorship of labor over the former exploiting
classes, the revolution failed, giving rise to Hitler Fascism,
which made World War II inevitable. This titanic conflict could
have been avoided had the German Socialists set up their
dictatorship over the former masters, thereby saving millions of
human lives not to mention the Billions of wasted dollars.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#note">[1]</a></p>
<p>Lenin points out that "The state in any country is merely the
instrument of the class in power". In the US for instance the
State is the instrument of the Capitalist class. In the Socialist
countries the state is the instrument of the working class.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#note">[2]</a> Communist theory calls for the "withering
away" of the state power after, and ONLY after the completion of
building of the Communist society.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#note">[3]</a></p>
<p>There are several irreconcilable contradictions that are
wracking the "free world" today, with inevitable victory of
Socialism as a consequence.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#note">[4]</a> First is the
contradiction between capital and labor, with capital seeking the
most it can get from the toil of labor, and the worker waging a
struggle against capital for the best wage possible. This
struggle goes on in Congress, on picket lines, across bargaining
tables, and in the courts.</p>
<p>Second contradiction is between the capitalists themselves and
between the capitalists of all "Free World" countries. There is
their eternal rivalry for world markets and for sources of raw
materials. For instance , there is the rivalry between the US and
British Commonwealth with the European Market countries,
Scandinavian countries, etc. Last contradiction is between the
"Free World" and the Socialist countries with their planned
economies. None of the foregoing contradictions are operative in
the Socialist countries as they have solved them by
revolution.</p>
<p>The present composition of congress and the Cabinet
overwhelmingly pro-Capitalist will deny enough social progress to
prevent the outbreak of more serious struggle of the workers. So
this can only mean that there is, and will remain, a class
struggle. The workers will be forced to wage an ever more serious
struggle merely for the right to live. The degree of violence
used during these struggles will depend on how violently the
capitalist class oppose us in this struggle for our right to
live.</p>
<p>As the onrushing Depression deepens, the class struggle will
grow in intensity, and the issues will clarify in the winds of
the people in the lower brackets, which in turn will elevate the
struggle to higher and higher levels. As the struggle mounts, so
will mount repressive action against us. The class in power will
most certainly seek to maintain its position of power. This is
only natural, and so it will be when Socialism is born. That is
to say, "the class in power will try and maintain its position by
any means available to it-or retreat from Socialist power.</p>

<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#return">[1]</a> This is a gross oversimplification
of history. "Militant Leninist Communists" were willing to
sacrifice the far greater militancy of the Trotskyist POUM
Militia, Anarcho Syndicalist CNT, and Anarchist FAI and Friends
of Durutti in the Spanish Revolution of 1936. They went as far as
collaboration with Capitalist powers, such as the USA, British,
and French who were also trading with the Franco-led Fascists as
well as Mussolini and Hitler in the 1930s. Scribner overlooks
alternative radical tendencies, including anarchism, syndicalism,
and industrial unionism, ALL of which differed in both theory and
practice from Leninist Communism.</p>
<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#return">[2]</a> This is also debatable. Some would
argue that what Scribner ACTUALLY means is that the government
REPRESENTS the working class. However leftist critics of Leninism
argue that this merely represents a bureaucratic form of state
run capitalism, because represents doesn't equal "is". In other
words, the state and its bureaucracy represent the ruling class
in a "socialist" state (since they make all the decisions), and
the workers are still exploited, since they have no more decision
making ability than they would in a capitalist state.</p>
<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#return">[3]</a> Contrast this theory with that held
by libertarian-communists, that the state must be abolished in
order to complete the communist society. At times, even Lenin
espoused this view (or at least claimed he did).</p>
<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner28/#return">[4]</a> History has, thus far, not borne
this out. Socialists of various stripes have failed to account
for Capitalism's ability to reinvent itself and create artificial
needs, even in times of plenty, such that artificial scarcities
are created. For example, the invention of the credit card has
allowed many in the working class to spend more money for
creature comforts, such as televisions, stereo systems, household
appliances, and so forth. The price paid, however, is debt and
interest payments. Capitalists are creating more and more ways
for individual working people to practice personal deficit
spending at greater and greater rates of cost. As long as working
people keep falling for it, the Capitalist System will keep on
winning the battle.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
