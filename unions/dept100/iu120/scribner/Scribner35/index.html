<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>In the year of 1912 I heard Eugene V. Debs predict the victory
of Socialism over the forces of Capitalism. I believed it
then-and I believe it now (in 1966)-more than ever before.</p>
<p>Radicals generally, have given up the fight for Socialism
mainly because of a lot of false notions as to the invincibility
of Capitalism. They see the continuing almost uninterrupted boom
conditions prevailing since [World] War II. Some of them seem to
think that the theory of Marx-Lenin is outdated. Events will soon
prove them wrong, and Marx-Lenin correct.</p>
<p>The system of world capitalism collapsed in the 1930s and the
fake nostrums of Mr. Franklin D Roosevelt was able only to
partially revive it. Yet, in spite of the expenditure of billions
of dollars for relief, relief work, unemployment compensation,
Social Security, and the like, the US still had ten million
unemployed at the outset of World War II.</p>
<p>Hitler became the "fair haired boy" who was to "save the world
from Bolshevism" in the 1930s. He was allowed to rearm Germany
and was given all possible assistance by the ruling class of the
whole world. Then came the formation of the Axis of
Germany-Italy-Japan. The Capitalist world gave them every
assistance in their struggle "against Communism".</p>
<p>We all know the rest, but what we don't seem to realize is the
fact that the US has now stepped into the shoes of the defeated
Axis powers and is now attempting to lead the "Free World" (the
Capitalist Class) in the struggle "against Communism" and it will
meet the same fate as did Adolph Hitler.</p>
<a id="1" name="1"></a>
<p>The German working class was a more or less bribed working
class getting fairly good pay as a result of the German seizure
of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other conquered territory.
Today-the American working class is a more or less bribed working
class which is also living off the plunder of US imperialism
abroad. This is why Mr. George Meany<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner35/#notes">[1]</a>, Mr.
Walter Ruether, and their cohorts are in favor of the present
administration policy of the Cold War, the arms race, the Vietnam
War, and the rest. This proves another basic tenet of
Marxist-Leninists that the leaders of organized labor are "agents
of the capitalist class within the ranks of labor."<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner35/#notes">[2]</a></p>
<p>On the continuing economic boom in the "Free World" there is
one simple logical reason. At the close of [World] War II with
the whole of Europe and Japan bombed out of existence there was
bound to be an economic upsurge given a "banker" country to foot
the needed loans. That was the US with its means of production
intact. The Marshall plan did the chore. Then we saw emerge the
so-called "economic miracle" of West Germany. There was an
immense pick-up in Japan, Italy, England, and France. Naturally,
business boomed over here too. Things began to slump in 1950
which was a main reason for the Korean War. In order to sustain
the pick-up, a re-arming program was begun, and the US supplied
tanks, planes, and modern weapons to the whole world.</p>
<p>This has had the effect of dampening down the world
revolutionary movement, but at the same time laying the basis for
a real upsurge later on. The peoples of the world are getting
tired of being targets for imperialism merely to keep business
booming in imperialist countries and working people of the world
around are getting tired of this eternal cycle of "boom, bust,
depression, and war."</p>
<a id="3" name="3"></a>
<p>So-we will soon see a vast revival of Marxist-Leninist
activity throughout the whole world.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner35/#notes">[3]</a> This
is inevitable, simply because an economic depression is
inevitable, and history records that struggle always increases
during an economic letdown. Each boom generates its
opposite-depression. The up-coming depression bids fair to make
all others look like a pink tea social by comparison, a "little
dandy"!</p>
<p>The Socialist world will be exempt from the ravages of
depression as they are well on the road of solutions of economic
problems. Those people have HAD their slowdown with the master
class. Unemployment has been eliminated, production steadily
increases, and hunger has been banished. What an example,
especially when once more the workers of the "Free World" hunt
non-existent jobs, wage cuts, high prices, diminishing pensions
and the like! Just as surely as we have done many times in the
past-we will face this same situation again!</p>
<p>The times demand that the US workers organize a genuine
Marxist-Leninist movement that will be capable of organizing the
American workers into an organization strong enough to resist
this imperialist offensive against their living standards. Our
group in the Eureka, California vicinity in 1957-62 through our
activities did not exactly evolve any new contribution to the
theory of Marxism-Leninism but we DID prove that the old
discarded theory (discarded by many "Marxist-Leninists") was
still valid.</p>
<p>It took 30% unemployment of the labor force in Humboldt,
Mendocino, and Del Norte Counties to get a struggle going for
unemployed organization. Local Communist party members said we
were "outdated", "behind the times", "living in the past", etc.
And yet, when the chips were down-struggle was born out of which
came many gains for unemployed. When the sawmills resumed in 1959
our group, mostly lumberjacks transferred our movement into
another field which had been discarded by the
pinkos-rank-and-file activity within the lumber locals of AFL and
CIO woodworkers. This worked every bit as good as it ever did in
the "old days". So, to sum up in a few words, we invented no new
theory, but we merely reaffirmed the validity of Marxist-Leninist
theory of "united front from below", that is, rank-and-file
activity within reactionary led unions and independent
organization of the unemployed. This is of course, part of the
drive to "organize the unorganized". There are only a trifle over
20 million organized workers in the US out of some 70 million in
the labor force!</p>
<p>These more than fifty million workers that are unorganized
today constitute the main body of the proletariat; the
propertyless individuals whose historic task is the overthrow of
capitalism. Let us proceed forthwith in a vast attempt to
organize these people into some sort of catch-all organization
perhaps similar to the old Workers Alliance. It could be called
an "all workers union'. This could become a decisive force for
peace and against imperialism in present day US.</p>
<p>Before any great success can be achieved in this line there
must be some kind of Marxist-Leninist unity accomplished first.
Most of the Marxist-Leninist groups now in existence today agree
on the nature of the State. Most of them agree that US
imperialism is the main source of wars and the worst enemy of the
people. Their other differences are mainly over tactics. First
order of business it would seem to me, would be a unity
conference of these groups to see what might be done towards a
new start on the road of Revolution.</p>
<a id="4" name="4"></a>
<p>Millions of Americans already know that war and imperialism
are "gold dust twins". To really assure peace in the world, you
simply have to remove imperialism, the source of war! When this
great historic task is finished we can get where the next main
enemy, hunger and want can be eliminated forever. I arrive at
this view of the world situation after more than fifty years
experience in the American revolutionary movement, including the
IWW, the Communist Party, the West Coast Committee, and the
Provisional Organizing Committee. Poor health has got me out of
all this at the moment, but I would still take part in a unity
conference of the left if one could be arranged.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner35/#notes">[4]</a></p>
<p>Goodbye, and don't let the middle of the road extremists get
you down!</p>
