<p><b>And also from the pages of <i>Lumberjack News</i>, located
at that time in Eureka, California.</b></p>
<p>There is a hell of an uproar in the nations press about the
giant roaming the hills of Humboldt and Del Norte County. He
makes footprints 16 inches long and seven inches wide! They all
try and make out that it's a big mystery but it's no mystery at
all to us old time lumberjacks, especially to those among us who
were logging in the vicinity years ago. We knowed him as Bigfoot
Wallace, and I got to know the gent quite well back in 1919.</p>
<p>One of our periodic depressions were on in that year and most
camps and sawmills were shut down around Seattle so I took a wild
lonesome down California way and wound up setting chokers in a
new logging camp near Blue Lake in Humboldt County.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/agitators/classic/BlackCat1.jpg" align="right" />This Bigfoot was also a big Hoosier and he had no
time for us Wobblies as he had tendencies towards becoming stump
rancher. He finally got hold of 160 acres of logged off land and
hit upon the idea of buying up bull calves and raising them on
this land. He done all right for a while as he would use these
half grown bulls to pull a stump puller arrangement in order to
clear hay land. Then he would ship these bulls to market. He kept
buying up bulls and shipping them until we got to calling him the
"Big Bull Shipper"</p>
<p>Finally, as the depression deepened it seemed that the more
bulls he shipped, the less money he made although at that time he
was the biggest bullshipper in Humboldt County! And then hard
times caught up with the logging camp and they shut down. The Big
bull shipper kept right on shipping bulls until he was plump
brokeand mad clear thru. He finally got made enough that we could
sign him up in the IWW and then when he found out what was going
on in the world he was a new man entirely!</p>
<p>After the outfit shut down I got a job of pearl diving in a
restaurant. Some of the other loggers were cutting wood and doing
other odd jobs. We had a little poker game going on there in town
and we got the bullshipper in it. He had lost his place by then
and had finished up with the bullshipping, and he was a red hot
wobbly by then.</p>
<p>One night in the poker game the boys had cleaned him complete
and entire, so one of the guys said, "Hell, Bigfoot, put in your
cork shoes, as they will make a good conversation piece
anyway."</p>
<p>Another says, "put in your rain suit, as they will make a good
tarp."</p>
<p>Well, we literally stripped the bullshipper that night so when
the game was over he stood up and announced: "Boys, I'm a gonna
go into the woods, live on fruit, nuts, roots, and berries, and I
ain't coming back until the Wobblies has taken over!"</p>
<p>Thats the last any of us ever seen of him. Now here it is away
up in 1960, and people traveling the roads up in Humboldt and Del
Norte are seeing a big hairy monster in their headlights and
wondering what it is. I can tell them. Its just the big
bullshipper came back to see if the Wobblies have taken over!
