<p>On Pearl Harbor Day, yours truly was employed as a pond monkey
at a sawmill in the little town of Sisters, Oregon, near Bend and
Redmond. Had been there since 1939. I had seen World War II
coming ever since the Spanish Revolution. US Governmental policy
had been to passively aid Franco and his pals Hitler and
Mussolini. I had made the bucket<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner19/#note">[1]</a> up in
Seattle for being on the picket line trying to prevent scrap iron
from going to Japan. Prior to that, had been pinched in Seattle
for participating in demonstration against war and fascism. Oh
yes, it was plain that war was coming all right. British, French,
and American policy at that time was to aid and abet the struggle
of the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) in their efforts
to "abolish Bolshevism".</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/agitators/modern/R_T_Meyers/iww_in_timber_country2.jpg" align="right" /> Hitler took a long hard look at the Russian Red
Army and he decided that the safest bet was to attack France,
Britain, and the Low Countries<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner19/#note">[2]</a>, which he
did. It was at this point that the British, French, and American
Governments fell out of Hitler's bed.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner19/#note">[3]</a> The
US began in earnest to help the British and French, instead of
Herr Hitler. The French were betrayed by their own high command
which was Pro-Hitler and they left the town of Sedan undefended
thus allowing the Germans to outflank the Maginot line.</p>
<p>The Hitler made the granddaddy of ALL mistakes by attacking
the Red Army, thereby sealing his doom as he now had a two front
war, with practically the whole world lined up against the
Axis.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner19/#note">[4]</a> I can plainly recall being the only
man in the town of Sisters who saw defeat for Hitler at that time
(1940). They were all listening to military "experts" who had it
that "Hitler would be in Moscow in 30 days."</p>
<p>And then-Pearl Harbor! The little town of Sisters was, like
the rest of the world, electrified by the news. The sawmill shut
down on Monday as several of the crew wanted to go over to Salem
and volunteer for the army. Two of us of [World] War I vintage
went over together to volunteer. The recruiter took one look at
us and rejected us because of age, as "too old" My partner says,
"Hell Scrib, let's go on over and join the German army as they
ain't so particular."</p>
<p>The recruiter yells, "You guys get the hell out of here as we
got a war to fight."</p>
<p>Old Whitey tells him, "well, from the looks of guys fighting
it we're gonna lose it for sure as hell."</p>
<p>So-we go back to Sisters to work in the mill. A few days
later, Oregon State begins to beef up its State Guard, so a
meeting is held at Bend, Oregon to organize a battalion of
Infantry for Central Oregon in order to "defend the two mountain
passes in case of Japanese invasion". There is to be a Company
each at Bend, Redmond, and Sisters.</p>
<p>The meeting at Bend was a "riot". There was a big discussion
about ways and means of organizing the battalion, [and] about the
possibility of a Japanese attack on Oregon and Washington. Then
one 'wise guy' from up Sisters way says, "What the hell are you
guys worrying about? Let the damn Japanese come if they want to,
as we'll just put 'em to work in these sawmills and starve 'em to
death!"</p>
<p>Then another guy chimes in and says, "Hell no, shut the mills
down and put 'em on unemployment compensation, and that WILL get
'em!"</p>
<p>After this bit of levity we got down to business and organized
the three companies. Myself and the man who went over to Salem to
volunteer were made Lieutenants and we drilled the company on
weekends on the school grounds. And what a company! Half of them
drunk and none of them taking it too seriously (the drill, that
is). I had them at what passed for "attention", then gave them a
"right face" and a "forward march" then a bit later, "halt", then
a "left face". There they were, scattered like a lot of damned
geese so I says, "Well boys, looks like we'll have to shut her
down until we get more men to fill up these holes."</p>
<p>The drill WAS stupid, as our main plan of defense was based on
bulldozers and dynamite, plus power saws to block the passes,
with our company acting as guerillas in the brush. You didn't
have to know how to march in cadence for THAT. We drilled the men
until they were drafted, then we would get new recruits in.
Finally the war came to a screeching halt and thus ended the
Sisters company of the Guard.</p>
