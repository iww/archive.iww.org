<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p><i>Here is an excerpt from the</i> Redwood Ripsaw <i>that I
wrote in May 1965. The next chapter contains a quote from the
works of Major general Smedley Butler, former Commandant of the
US Marines.</i></p>
<p>There is a lot of talk these days of American Imperialism,
Freedom, Democracy, Socialism, Free Enterprise, etc.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/agitators/classic/suits.jpg" align="right" />The shortest and best definition of imperialism
that I know of is that it is "the export of capital to the
sources of raw material." In effect this means that Yankee money
goes to, for instance, Santo Lomingo in the form of investments
in sugar plantations, refineries, etc. As labor is just another
cost item, anyplace in the "free world", it must be obtained as
cheaply as possible. This policy, "Cheap labor" brings on labor
unrest, so, the US Government grants "aid" to, for instance, the
Dominican Government. This puppet government then uses the aid
money to hire more police, increase its army in order to suppress
the unrest. This aid money is really paid by the US taxpayer-for
the greater glory of the private enterprizer involved. Should, by
any chance, the Dominican Government stand up for its own people
it is promptly labeled "Communist" and the US marines are ordered
in, in order to "defend Freedom against Communist
aggression."</p>
<p>And now we have the "Johnson Doctrine" as given out by
President [Lyndon] Johnson that, "we will not allow any Communist
governments in this hemisphere (or any OTHER hemispheres judging
from events in Vietnam). The "Ripsaw" believes in the right of
"self determination for all the people in the world". If they
wish to set up Communist governments they have every right to do
so. We Americans also have that inherent right-or have we? I am
afraid that property rights have superceded human rights a long
time ago in this country.</p>
<p>Websters definition of Communism and Socialism merely implies
that they mean, "producing property held in common" that is
Public property, rather than Private property.</p>
<p>Democracy would seem to mean that the people have the right to
a say-but do we? I was once employed at the sawmill of the
Shevlin-Hixon Company at Bend, Oregon. They sold their mill to
the Brooks-Scanlan Company throwing 2,000 men out of work. The
crew was not consulted as it was "none of their business", and it
wasn't! So much for Democracy!</p>
<p>If the general public owned the means of production, it would
not be considered "democratic" by the big shots!</p>
<p>The various brands of Socialists the world around seem to
think we can "peacefully evolve" into a Socialist society, that
is by means of moral persuasion. "Not so," say the 'way out
cats', the Marxist-Leninists. They say that it will require a
complete social revolution by a revolt of the workers, and their
allies to not only take over the means of production, but to also
set up a dictatorship of labor to replace the present
dictatorship of capital. To date, history has more or less
confirmed the correctness of this theory. This editor remembers
trying to put a skunk out of a bunk house with moral
persuasion-but it backfired. Well-so much for terms and the
meaning of all this present day ruction in this world.</p>
<p>As I said before, that system that produces the best living
standard for the most people will prevail in spite of hell and
high water, and in spite of the hysterical shenanigans of a
frightened master class. I welcome this competition, as I think
we all should, and let the best one win, or would you rather have
the WORST one win? Most Americans don't seem to realize that we
have a big business Government in the US. Sure, you have "free"
elections and you are free to vote for one or the other parties
of big business. Then, too, the news media (owned by this same
big bizz) helps you make up their mind.</p>
<p>If this all sounds a bit strong, remember this: it is so, but
most newspapers, (owned by big bizz) approach the matter more or
less like a cat tackles a bowl of hot porridge. Yours for
clarity!</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
