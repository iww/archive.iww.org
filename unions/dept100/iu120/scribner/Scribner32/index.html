<p class="redbar"></p>
<p><i>And now for a few excerpts from the</i> Redwood Ripsaw
<i>originated by the author in Davenport, California. This paper
started with 200 copies monthly and one year later had reached a
circulation of 1,700 copies.</i></p>
<p><b>Auto Billiards</b></p>
<p>On Sunday PM there was a minor traffic accident on Ocean St in
Davenport. The driver of the car that did the damage was one
Raphael Gonzalez. He turned in on Ocean Street from Cabrillo
Highway just a bit too fast, struck a Porsche car owned by a
couple named Kliegal, damaged a rear fender, ruined a tail and
turning light and then zoomed off across the street in a perfect
"billiard shot" and ran into the rear end of a "Merc" station
wagon. Damage was all minor, no one hurt.</p>
<p>I got what information I could from the "bull", but as I
suffer from the "bull horrors" when I get near those birds-like
once back in 1915 when we were on strike for twenty cents per
hour instead of the lousy fifteen cents we were getting, and the
bulls locked up some ten of us in the bucket, and dang it, all we
did was to lay out a couple of scabs with two by fours! Anyway, I
still get the bull horrors. When we asked him, what are you
holding us on, he said, "I dunno, but we'll think of something."
They did too, and we drew 30 days in the bucket-well, it's a free
country, ain't it?</p>
<p><b>Log Rolling Contest</b></p>
<p>It was partly the doings of this writer that the old logging
contest events will be staged again this year at Boulder Creek. I
had filed for the log rolling contest and the hand bucking
contest, and it created quite a stir simply because a man aged 65
would still be agile enough for this caper. (maybe I ain't)!
Anyway, come up and join the fun. Watch me get dunked, or dunk
someone else.</p>
<p>Friday there will be fun and games in the fire hall, a play,
"The Miner's Daughter" (Valley Players). Saturday will be the log
sawing contest, games for the kids, firemen's ballgame, log
rolling contest (watch it boy). Then comes noon parade, fashion
show, barbecue and then teenage dance. On Sunday is the chuck
wagon breakfast, whiskerino contest, horse show and parade. See
Jack Hays at Country store about entering the contest, (And bring
me some dry cigarettes)!</p>
<p><b>On the Economy</b></p>
<p>Big argument going on these days among the Wall Street
economists. Some say there is a slowdown in the pickup. On the
other hand others say there is a pickup in the slowdown. If there
is a slowdown in the pickup, this may lead to a pickup in the
slowdown, in which case it might do to grind the valves, or turn
it in on a later model.</p>
<p><b>Special Announcement</b></p>
<p>This issue of the Ripsaw (July 1965) will be the last for at
least a period of two or three months while ye editor goes on a
summer "vacation" up in the timber country.</p>
<p>The "vacation" will consist of hunting up a pond monkey job at
a sawmill (if one can be fond at my age). In case I do find one,
will stay with it-if health and strength permits.</p>
<p>If such a job is found, will write, and publish a book in
letter size, mimeo form and THAT will require a year or so. The
Ripsaw wishes to take this opportunity to thank its advertisers,
supporters, and readers very much for their kind support which
has enabled it to reach a circulation of 1,700 from its modest
start of 200 copies a year ago. 1,700 is really SOME circulation
for a town of 300 people!</p>
<a id="1" name="1"></a>
<p>We will leave you with some predictions of things to come, and
you might check on these predictions later. Number one: The
American Imperialist forces will be defeated in Asia.<a href="#notes">[1]</a> THE PEOPLE, not modern arms are the
deciding factor, and the people over there are against our
present imperialist policy of "breaking and entering, and armed
robbery". This war, which I being escalated in Asia for the long
range purpose of "stopping Communism". will by its effect on the
people of Asia increase their hatred of the money class and will
also create more misery, which will hasten the growth of
communism.</p>
<a id="2" name="2"></a>
<p>Prediction number two: with the American economy running at
almost full capacity to supply war needs, there are already many
straws in the wind showing signs of an approaching economic
crisis. Regardless of what the "experts" say, this could be
another 1929-or worse type of let down. (Any high school student
can tell of the "business cycle") <a href="#notes">[2]</a></p>
<a id="3" name="3"></a>
<p>Here are some factual "hair raisers" to conjure with: The
Federal Deposits and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has guaranteed
deposits to the tune of 192 BILLION dollars, while its reserves
amount to only ONE BILLION 200 million dollars! Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) has guaranteed debts to a
total of 88 billion dollars and its reserves are only one
billion, one-hundred million dollars. If this isn't enough,
consider the fact that there is more Federal, State, County, and
individual debts than ever before in history.<a href="#notes">[3]</a></p>
<p>Let's look at a few of these "props" that are supposed to
shore up the economy in case of a let-down. Social Security is
one mentioned. This money comes from payroll deductions, and
employer contributions. A serious let down is bound to slow up
this revenue. Tax collections will also fall off. Unemployment
compensation is another "prop". If it's so good in this respect,
how come the employers fight it so much? This fund can, and does
run out in a lot down.</p>
<p>By stopping the present stupidity in Vietnam the Government
could put that over two million bucks per day towards retiring
Federal Debt and build much needed hospitals, schools, highways,
etc. OVER HERE, but no-we have to "stop communism" by increasing
misery-and hence more communism OVER THERE!</p>

<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner32/#1">[1]</a> True, but not without great cost to
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.</p>
<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner32/#2">[2]</a> True; in 1973 the ruling classes of the
United States, Germany, and Japan dismantled the Bretton Woods
economic system. Real wages have decreased since then. Up until
that time, most families consisted of one working adult. After
1973, a great many families consisted of two working adults, but
real household wealth did not increase appreciably.</p>
<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner32/#3">[3]</a> And in 1985, thanks to Reagan
Administration-led deregulation, the FSLCI defaulted on over Five
Billion Dollars of Savings and Loan Debts, all to be paid by
taxpayers. Furthermore, $1.6 billion of these dollars were the
responsibility of MAXXAM owner Charles Hurwitz.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
