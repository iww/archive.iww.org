<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>The Working Class and the Employing Class have nothing in
common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are
found among the millions of working people, and the few, who make
up the Employing Class, have all the good things of life.</p>
<p>Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the
workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the
earth and the machinery of production, and abolish the wage
system. . . .It is the historic mission of the working class to
do away with capitalism.</p>
<p>So states, in part, the <i>Preamble to the Constitution of the
IWW</i>. Right now it must be stated that this organization made
more gains for lumber workers than any other organization ever
did to date.</p>
<p>Among these gains: Wages, hours, and working conditions. The
most outstanding were: Clean bunk houses., shower baths, company
furnished bedding, elimination of the old "muzzle loading" double
decked bunks, later on the limitation of 8 men to a bunk house.
In the winter of 1914-15 I saw some 150 men living in one bunk
house in Northern Minnesota. Shower baths were unheard of. Can
you imagine the stench of 150 pair of socks hung up to dry around
the bunk house stove! Those bunk houses were vermin infested and
the 'Jacks would boil up their clothes on Sunday, and if the
weather was fit, would burn sulphur in the bunk house to kill the
vermin. When your clothes were dry you would "read" your shirt to
get rid of the vermin. By Monday night the knits would hatch, and
you were jut as lousy as ever!</p>
<p>The wages for swampers was some twenty six buck per month for
a sixty hour week. These were the kind f conditions that brought
on the big strike of the IWW in the Lake States timber region in
1914-15. The strike was defeated mainly because the 'jacks were
leaving the Lake states for the newer timber regions of the
Pacific Northwest. (Ye author joined the trek in 1916). I had
just come in with the spring log drive on the Big Fork River, and
bought a ticket on passenger train for Everett, Washington. Was
arrested at the depot in Everett, thrown in the bucket, and when
they saw my Wobbly card I was beaten up, and next morning ran out
of town. This was because of the Verona affair, the famous
"Everett Massacre."</p>
<p>The Shingle Weavers, and the IWW were on strike and Martial
law had been proclaimed in Everett. Speaking on the street was
banned. Wobblies were arrested for trying to speak, so footloose
wobblies came from near and far to speak on the streetand were
promptly arrested. Soon the jails were full and as every wobbly
demanded a jury trial, the authorities were plenty worried. Then
the "Wobs" chartered a tug boat in Seattle and 300 of them came
to Everett on the boat just to speak on the street. They were met
by machine gun fire from some trigger happy guardsman, and four
were killed outright, and scored wounded. The wobs were unarmed.
Public opinion, plus continued wobbly efforts finally won the
free speech fight, as well as the strike. These events gave a
tremendous boost to the IWW and they grew, and thrived. By 1917
the Pacific coast logger was the best paid, best fed, and best
housed worker in the United States.</p>
<p>The IWW was a tough, militant labor organization that believed
in only job action. Their tactics got results, not only in lumber
but in all other industries. The best tactic, I believe, was the
"strike on the job" caper. When an open strike was defeated by
the employer, we "struck on the job" by slowing down production
until the employer finally gave in. If the employer would get
disgusted enough to can the whole crew, the new crew would
continue the strike. Word was passed in the employment offices in
town that the strike was on. A good many strikes were won in this
way.</p>
<p>When we launched a campaign to make the employers furnish
bedding in the camps we had another tactic that worked, rough as
it was. We had five man committees to meet the trains, boats, and
busses. The five man committees would ask the workers to give up
their blankets and they would explain why. Most of the members
would gladly comply, but "Mr. William Shears" (Scissor Bill)
would object. The committee would collect his blankets
regardless. The blankets would be heaped up in large piles and
burned on the streets. It wasnt very long until the signs at the
employment offices asking for "One choker setter, one bucker,
must have blankets" completely disappeared simply because there
were no more men with their own blankets.</p>
<p>We also had one hell of a time getting the employers to
furnish clean sheets, and shower baths, as well as decent food.
Moral persuasion never got us a damned thing! I well remember one
boss logger hollering at the committee, "who ever heard of a
logger wanting a shower bath?" Well he heard of THAT crew wanting
oneand we got it too! Meantime the "fever" was spreading.</p>
<p>Getting the 8 hour day was another tough one, but we finally
did that too, in the camps, that is. Most of the mills had crews
of stump ranchers, Scissor Bills, and "Big Hoosiers" so the 10
hour day remained for some time. There were many "quicky" or
sporadic strikes for the 8 hour day, and finally a general strike
in 1917, In one of the isolated quicky strikes in a Columbia
River logging camp I became a spokesman in a sort of odd way. I
was a "whistle punk" in this camp and the rigger crew put me up
to blowing the quit whistle at 4 PM in case the engineer didn't.
Well, he didn't, so I did and the whole crew, sniper, rigging
men, chasers, loaders, and buckers and fallers assembled at the
spar tree to go in on the crummy.</p>
<p>The hook tender asked me why I blew the whistle so I told him
8 hours was enough. He canned me right there, so most of the crew
told him, all right Jack, you can get a whole new crew then if
you can that Goddam kid! Well, the hooker called headquarters for
instructions, we are all reinstated, and we have the 8 hour day.
It wasnt always that easy though.</p>
<a id="1" name="1"></a>
<p>There was another bitter struggle getting rid of the upper
bunks in the bunk houses. The bosses figured that 8 men in a bunk
house was OK but we wanted four men bunk houses. When other
methods failed we brought in hack saws sawed off the top bunks
and put them outside. Soon it became customary to have single
bunks. These were all big victories that were won by the once
great IWW. The Industrial Workers of the World. What is left of
that once great organization has now degenerated into just
another anti-Communist group and has very few active members who
have more or less forgotten the great day of Big Bill Haywood,
and Joe Hill.<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner2/#note">[1]</a></p>
<p>The IWW and the left wing Socialists were very much opposed to
American entry into World War One. As a result, hundreds of IWW
and Socialists were jailed. For the IWW the charge was criminal
syndicalism.</p>
<p>The IWW was very active in the lumber industry in 1917 and we
were making gains in wages, hours, and working conditions. As
deplorable as wages and conditions were, there was much room for
improvement. Then the employers, and their Government hatched up
a scheme to beat the IWW. They set up a new "Patriotic Union"
called the 4-L (Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen). This was
a pure and simple Company Union and in most locals, the
Superintendent of the mill would be "President" of the Local. The
company would furnish beer and other refreshments at the
meetings. Many times the boys would vote to cut their own wagesat
a time when lumber sold for a fantastic price. Naturally, there
were no "dues" in this phony union.</p>
<p>During this period the Spruce Division was formed in order to
get out spruce for airplanes. In some cases the "Spruce" that
turned out to be hemlock, a heavy wood of weak tensile strength
certainly not suitable for planes. Then too, lumberjacks were
drafted into the Spruce Divisionat army paywhile the employers
made a killing from this slave labor, and fat Government
contracts. To the undying glory of the IWW, they fought this
unholy conspiracy tooth and nail, and many of them went to
jail.</p>

<li>While in the Cook County Jail, (Chicago) Ralph Chaplin wrote
<a href="../Scribner-Chaplin1/" target="_blank">The Red
Feast</a>.</li>
<li>The perception of Joe Hill, the IWW songbird is shown by the
following song, written by him before 1915 <a href="../Scribner-JoeHill1/" target="_blank">The Commonwealth
of Toil</a>.</li>
<li>Along in 1916-17 the IWW had a song going the rounds about
the practice of carrying ones own blankets - <a href="../Scribner-50K/" target="_blank">50,000
Lumberjacks</a>.</li>
<li>One verse of "The Portland Revolution" by Dublin Dan:</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<p>The Revolution started, so the judge informed the Mayor<br />
Now Baker paces back and forth, and raves and pulls his
hair<br />
The waterfront is tied up tight, the Portland newsboy howls<br />
And not a thing is moving, only Mayor Bakers bowels.</p>
</li>
<li>Attesting to the "popularity" of the "Wobblies" we reprint
the following song by T-Bone Slim - <a href="../Scribner-TBone1/" target="_blank">The Popular
Wobbly</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were only a few of the songs of the "Wobblies" and we
may run a few more in order to show the stand of the Wobblies
towards organized religion. In the early days that is, in my time
in the organization, 1914-23 we often stated our non-political
stand and yetwe used political action many times. Once, for
instance, when some five thousand members of the IWW stood
shoulder to shoulder in Seattle Washington and lined up on both
sides of a street wearing huge buttons on which was inscribed
"Free Tom Mooney". This was on the occasion of a visit of
President Woodrow Wilson in 1919 to Seattle when he was on a
Nationwide tour to drum up support for the League of Nations.
Judging from the look on his face when he saw the big line-up of
working men with those buttons I would say that he got the
message.</p>
<p>Along with thousands of other members, I was confused by the
big event of the October Revolution in Russia. When the
organization split in the early twenties our membership started a
rapid decline.</p>
<p>Whatever else may be said of the Wobblies, it must be admitted
that they blazed the trail for the big industrial unions that
were to follow, such as the CIO unions.</p>
<p>The world was young, theory of Communism was almost unknown
when the Wobblies "walked the woods with seven league boots". Our
enemies called us "Pro-German" because Karl Marx was German. Then
came the Russian Revolution with a new birth of revolutionary
theory, Many Wobblies said, "Hell, these Russkies DID it, and
beat us to it". Even at this late date (1966) wealthy retired
lumbermen (Boss Loggers) still get the jitters at the mere
mention of the Wobblies!</p>
<ul>
<li>Herewith is another song from the "Little Red Songbook" - <a href="../Scribner-Brill1/" target="_blank">Dump the Bosses Off
Your Back</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Space limitations force me to leave the "Wobbly Era" and
proceed with the rest of this book, but to sum up: The IWW made
more concrete gains for lumberjacks than any other union ever
did. We were short on theory, true enough, and we died as an
organization as a result, but let no man say that we didnt make
great and lasting gains for labor. Briefly they were: the 8 hour
day; clean camps; eliminated the practice of carrying one's own
bedding; obtained shower baths in camps; Gave the loggers the
highest pay in the US than any other industrial workers.</p>
<p>It took an awful lot of struggle to do these things and many a
Wobbly paid with his life. Lots of us were blacklisted, jailed,
ran out of towns, and otherwise persecuted.</p>
<p>There are still some members left of the once gallant IWW but
they are a shadow of their former self. Most of us of the Big
Bill Haywood, Joe Hill era are dead and gone, or have defected to
the Communist camp. Such is the order of the day. With this
thought I leave the "Fellow Workers" of the IWW and proceed with
the rest of the book.</p>

<p class="blackbar"><a id="note" name="note">Footnote</a></p>
<p><a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner2/#1">[1]</a> This is not true. In the early 1920s, the
General Executive Board of the IWW voted against aligning the IWW
with the Red Trade Union International in Moscow, which is
exactly what is mandated by the IWW Constitution. Tom Scribner
(and many others) supported an alliance with the Red Trade Union
International since the Russian Revolution and the Bolshevism
were (erroneously, as it now turns out) considered by many to
represent the natural evolution of Industrial Unionism.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
