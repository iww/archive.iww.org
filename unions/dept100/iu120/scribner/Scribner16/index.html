<p>It seems to me that Big George told me that it happened up in
Portland on the skidroad, but I won't vouch for the exact spot,
but dad gum it, he told me anyway, so I will try and set it down.
Also, Big George and I were lapping up a beer or two up in
Aberdeen on the Harbor when he told me.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/agitators/classic/londonscabsm.jpg" align="right" />"Dang it," he says, "I was just about broke, down
to about three shackles, it was snowing and raining, and no jobs
on the boards, and I had just begun to" Some big Hoosier grabs
George from behind and spins him around at this point and George
says, "well, I'll be damned; Tanker Jack!" Then he introduces me
to Jack so I jerk a nod in his direction as he looks like timber,
and just to be polite, I says,</p>
<p>"Hi Tanker, how's the stem end of your gizzard?"</p>
<p>Big George cuts in and says, "What's on your mind Tanker, as
if I didn't know?"</p>
<p>"Now George," says the Tank, "are you gonna set 'em up just
for old time sake?"</p>
<p>"OK Jack, but just one because I ain't too flush at the
moment." George yells at the bartender, "give Tank a beer."</p>
<p>George says to me, "come on Pop, lets go down the bar a ways
and git away from Tanker on account of when the old fool gets a
drink or two he generally gits noisy as hell, and we just might
wind up in the bucket for ten days."</p>
<p>"So, we move down the bar a ways so George can tell me what he
started to when old Tanker cut in.</p>
<p>"Well, it was up to Portland that I was and no jobs on the
boards. I was just beginning to think that I hadn't ought to have
quit my last job, but on the other hand I had enough of that
damned job."</p>
<p>Another interruption now, as the bartender bangs a glass down
on the bar and hollers, "All right Tanker, you are flat gonna
have to cut down on your language a bit as there are ladies in
here."</p>
<p>Old Tanker hollers back, "what the hell barkeep, them ain't
ladies, them's lumberjacks wives!" Everybody gets a kick out of
that, even the ladies, so the barkeep subsides and says,</p>
<p>"OK, jack but watch it a little or out you go."</p>
<p>"Well George," I says, "Just where in hell was we at when all
this foolishness started?"</p>
<p>"Well, I was going to tell you why I quit that job. In the
first place it was nonunion, payed under the scale, ran 9 hours
straight time, a windshield broken out of the damned Ape Wagon,
and what with a thirty mile ride they liked to freeze us to
death."</p>
<p>"Just a Goddam minute George, what in tophet is an `Ape
Wagon'? I ain't never heard of the like of that in my time in the
timber. Of course I quit the brush in 1935 and they ain't no
tellin' what you young bucks do these days."</p>
<p>"Poor old Pop," says George, "you sure are behind the times a
bit. Well, the Ape Wagon is what you guys called a `Crummy' and
it's just a station wagon that we ride to work in. We call it an
Ape Wagon because we are just 'trained apes' or `brush apes',
hence Ape Wagon. Now, do you get the drift or do I have to snow
again? Then, too, I had other troubles. I had taken a hell of a
dislike to the cat skinner, as that log hungry son-of-a-bitch of
a gyppo was really on us to get out the logs. I blew a gasket one
day and flat told the ink slinger to mix me up a hike, and I
proceeds to get the hell away from there."</p>
<p>"Well George," I says, "How come you didn't organize a union
local there and GET some conditions? Dammitt, that's the trouble
with you guys, you try to FIND conditions instead of MAKING
them!"</p>
<p>"Damn it Pop, we TRIED to organize a union but the guys are
disgusted on account of the two unions fighting each other,
instead of the boss, so there wasn't but a few of us tried. When
they turned down the union deal I made up my mind to slope. As
usual, I'm broke after a few days on the skidroad so I mosey
around town keeping the eyes and ears open for a job on the
rigging, bucking, falling, or what have you. Figured I might as
well have a beer or two, so I enter a bar and squeeze in between
a few gents who look like timber and I orders up a beer. He
begins telling me how he had been working for an outfit down in
California that was on strike, so I begins to think, here I am
buying beer for a dad gummed scab! I fixed him right up though! I
waited till he tipped the bottle up for a snort, then I gave him
the edge of my hand right on his throat, and he goes down on the
floor gasping for breath! I knowed I was bull bait then, so I
took off up the street to another bar. This bar has a sort of
cubby hole coffee joint right in the front part of the bar, so I
gets a cup and waits.</p>
<p>"Sure enough, here comes Mr. Scab, and just as soon as he
pokes his beak into the joint, I floors him with a clip on the
jaw, and I take off again. Then I goes into another bar and this
time I go away down to the back end. Pretty soon Mr. Scab comes
in there TOO. Boy he sure is a durable bastard! He comes in and
starts walking down towards the back end looking at everyone till
he gets right by me and then the barkeep says, "what'll it be
friend" I figures now's my chance so I clout him over the head
with the bottle and down he goes, this time for the count, I
betcha!</p>
<p>"Well, I hurried to get out of there, but a couple bulls came
in and held me up long enough to find out I was the guilty guy,
so I draws ten days in the bucket. Anyway when I gets out the
weather is better, so I did manage to get back to work. Only
thing I regret is that I didn't make some man tracks on that
damned scab when he was down!</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
