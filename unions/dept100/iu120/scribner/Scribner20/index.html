<p>'Short Log Gabriel' and yours truly had just unloaded off a
manifest freight train in the yards at Eugene, Oregon along about
June f 1957. She was going a pretty good clatter, and when we
unloaded old Short Log had to go and stub his tow on the end of a
tie on the roadbed, In the first place he is kinda short coupled
and sway backed, like one of them percheron horses, and his feet
ain't able to keep up, so he comes a cropper.</p>
<p>Well, old Short Log, he ain't like most loggers, not him. He
is sort of a genteel type, so about all he does is to dig the
ground in dirt and rocks out of his mangled hands; feels himself
over a bit for broken bones and says to me, "Jumpin' Christ Pop!
I must be getting' more old and stove than what you are."</p>
<p>"I agree, Short Log, on account of you won't lay off the
stupid juice, so what do you expect? Hell man, you are about as
graceful as a bull elephant out in the brush! And what's more, if
you had behaved yourself on that rafting job up on the Columbia
River, why chances are we could still be working instead of out
here on the bum!"</p>
<p>"Hold up there a goddam minute Pop. You know damn well they
went to strapping the loads and they fired the whole bunch of
rafters there just two days after we left, as they don't NEED 'em
any more."</p>
<p>"Just the same," I says, "if you hadn't come to work drunk
that day and fell in the river, we could have been still working
as they MIGHT have transferred us some place else."</p>
<p>"Like WHERE?" says old Short Log, "when they are strapping the
loads now all over!"</p>
<p>"And another thing Short Log. You wasn't satisfied just
falling in, you had to go and sing one of them damn Wobbly songs
and I could hear you clear up on the other raft, 'Work and pray,
live on hay, you'll get pie in the sky when you die."</p>
<p>"About the time you hit the second chorus, here comes old
Andy, and you know damn well that he is a preacher in his spare
time, and he don't go for that. You also should have knowed them
Oklahoma Nationals and them second growth Swedes don't go along
with that either! It did kinda tickle me when you told old Andy,
'All right Andy, you can take this here pike pole and shove it,
and if you can't do it, just stoop over and by God I'll do it for
you!'"</p>
<p>"Anyhow," says old Short Log, "being as how we are down here
in Eugene, let's go on over town and talk to some of the natives
and get lined up on the job situation."</p>
<a name="1"></a>
<p>"OK, I says, but I kinda got my doubts on account of we are
going into another Hoover Boom<a href="../unions/iu120/scribner/Scribner20/#notel">[1]</a> and this
one ain't gonna be a damn bit funny."</p>
<p>"Well Pop, maybe you are right and I only hope that if we are
gonna have one she will be a little dandy, and then maybe we can
DO something about it. By cripes Pop, do you see what I see? Most
of these burners are cold."</p>
<p>"That's what I been telling you; we are going into another
Hoover Boom and the lumber market is shot now, and that's only
the start."</p>
<p>"Hold it," says old Short Log, "there's a hell of a smoke
coming from over behind that old dead burner, so let's amble over
a look. Goddlemighty! They must be sawin', lumber like crazy from
the looks of that smoke. Black smoke would mean pine, but they
don't have pine in this country." We get a bit closer and see a
long low factory building all painted white and there is a lot of
smoke coming from a tall brick chimney.</p>
<p>Old Short Log says, "Pop, that sure as hell ain't a silver
factory, so just what in hell is it anyway?"</p>
<p>"I dunno Short Log, but here comes one of the slaves out so we
can ask him." The guy is all dressed in white, so he sure as hell
ain't a lumberjack, that's for sure.</p>
<p>He gets close enough to where we can talk to him, and Short
Log says, "Hi Mack! Just what in hell goes on in that building
you just came out of?"</p>
<p>"Kinda behind the times ain't you buster? That there is the
Drowzy Dawn Tranquilizer company, and it just so happens that my
name ain't Mack, and this factory runs three shifts, but they are
full handed, so no need to ask for a job."</p>
<p>Well, old Short Log is a kind of a dumbell so he asks the guy,
"Just what is them tranquilizers you are roaring about? Are they
some kind of new teleyphone crossarms, or what?"</p>
<p>"Hell no", says the Jerk, "they are a new kind of pill you
take to make you go to sleep."</p>
<p>"That wouldn't worry you any would it Short Log, as you can
always rustle a jug and then you don't give a damn whether you
sleep or not."</p>
<p>"Well Pop," says old Short Log, "Just what do you do if you
can't go off to sleep, or does it bother you any?"</p>
<p>"Sure it does, and I remember once when the mill I was workin'
in had cut down to three days a week, and I couldn't make my car
payment, rent, and the like, and I just flat could not sleep for
worrying about it. One guy on the job says, 'why don't you count
sheep?' Well sir, I tried that one night so I sort of dreamed up
a corral and had the sheep jumping over a fence, and I counted
them as they jumped. It worked pretty well until it seemed one of
'em got stuck between the two top poles of the corral and went to
blatting his fool head off. That done it! I got wide awake, and
mad at the whole deal, so mebbe we do need some pills."</p>
<p>"Now then," says 'Mack'. "You guys are sure old enough to
realize that if the working class owned the means of production
you wouldn't need to worry about all these things."</p>
<p>"There you go Short Log! That is exactly what we preached back
in the rip snorting days of the IWW back in 1914 but they wasn't
enough guys would join to make it stick. Now they got this new
fangled Comynist deal, and whilst it don't seem to get very far
over here, it's flat goin' to town in the rest of the world."</p>
<p>"Well Pop," says old Short Log, what do we do now?"</p>
<p>"Why don't just go on over town, look at the employment boards
and if there's nothing there, let's head back to Portland on the
soup line, sleep at the "Sally" and get busy on trying to set up
unemployed organization."</p>
<p>"Guess that's about all there is too do, Pop, so then we catch
the night manifest back to Portland and try to get these stiffs
organized."</p>
