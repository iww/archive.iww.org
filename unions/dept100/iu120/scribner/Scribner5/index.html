<p><b>Not all of my life in the timber has been confined to the
logging end of it as this article will show. I wrote this
following article which was printed in the <i>Lumbermans
Magazine</i> of Portland, Oregon in August of 1957.</b></p>
<p>The "Fast Rig" is a sawmill carriage. To be specific, this
fast rig is most generally found in the pine timber country. The
whole question of "fast" is relative, as nearly every sawmill
town from the Lake States to Seattle, Washington has the "fastest
rig" either real, or imagined.</p>
<p>These fast rigs are driven by a steam cylinder 12 to 14 inches
in diameter, and some 40 to 50 feet long, which lays on the floor
under the rig. It has a piston 6 to 8 inches in diameter which is
fastened on to the rig. That is the well known "shotgun feed",
and mister, those rigs (minus all the air and electric dogs, and
power setworks that clutter up the modern rig)really used to get
up and dangle!</p>
<p>In pine lumber production, as in fir, logs are dumped into the
pond and brought up the bull chain into the mill for cutting into
lumber.</p>
<p>At this point similarity between pine and fir ends as most of
the cutting in pine is done on the rig in order to cut for grade.
Standard length of pine lumber is 16 feet and thickness rarely
over two inches, so the HAVE to be fast in order to get a cut.
Other reasons for their high speed are that pine is softer, and
smaller.</p>
<p>Classics among the fast ones from any place were the "Cannon
Ball" in the sawmill of the International Lumber Company at
International Falls, Minnesota; the "Blue Streak" in the
Crookston Lumber Company mill at Bemidji, Minnesota, (A two block
rig); and the "Kitchen Rig" (another two block rig) in the mill
of the Cloquet Lumber Company at Cloquet, Minnesota. It was named
Kitchen Rig because when it was added on to the main mill a
kitchen type, or shanty rood was put over it.</p>
<p>Some western fast ones were the five rigs of the Shevlin-Hixon
Company at Bend, Oregon (14 inch shotguns) and there was the rig
in the Fandango mill of the Willow Ranch Lumber Company, Willow
Ranch, California. That one was a 14 inch gun that was plenty
lively. Then there was the Pony Rig in the mill of the Seattle
Cedar Lumber Company, at Seattle, Washington, a 12 inch shotgun
sawing cants from the headrig. No grass grew under it either!
However, none of these western rigs were in the Cannonball class
for speed.</p>
<p>Now let's go South for a look at the Long Leaf Pine. These was
the famous old mill of the Great Southern Lumber Company at
Bogalusa, Louisiana, at that time the biggest mill on earth with
four bands (14 inch shotguns) five resaws, two gangs and a twin
badLively!</p>
<p>The fastest cutting mill Ive ever seen was the mill of the
J.J. White Lumber Company at Columbia, Mississippi. It was only
an average speed rig but had more power than usual on the
circular saw and could cut faster as a result, I might also
mention here the mill of the Williams Yellow Pine Company, Wilco,
Mississippi; Long Bell Lumber Company, Woodworth, Louisiana; and
the Turner Pine Company, Uniform Alabama. All of these were fast
rigs, but not in the class of the Cannon Ball.</p>
<p>Just in case someone may ask, "How do you know about these
fast rigs?" I was employed as a dogger on them, as well as on
many more, with the exception of the J.J. White mill at Columbia,
Mississippi. Someone may also want to know WHY I went to the
trouble to work on them. Thats a GOOD question, but I guess the
answer was that I really wanted to know just WHICH one was the
fastest and the only way to know was to work on them. It took
several years starting in 1914 and working in seven states, plus
a province in Canada to find out.</p>
<p>After working on all these rigs I came to the conclusion that
the Cannon Ball was really the fastest rig ever built. The "Ball"
had a special boiler in order to have hot, dry steam and was a
light pole rig with a 12 inch rebored "gun" hand set works, and
boss dogs. This rig got the pick of long, straight Norway pine
for dimension. That is two weeks of my life I will never forget!
Seattle cedar clocked their rig at 13,500 feet per minute.
According to this the old Cannon Ball must have made 15,000 feet
per minute, and they gain this speed from a dead stop and do it
within one foot. Now try standing up on this and hand dogging the
logs on the carriage!</p>
<p>Another reason for my extensive ravels was to find that
Bunyanesque rig that was "So fast the dogger was tied on" There
is simply no such animal, but I DID see several I wouldn't mind
being tied OFF of. However the myth still persists.</p>
<p>At the time I was dogging on the "Ball" at International Falls
Minnesota. I used to cross the river to Fort Frances, Ontario
Canada where my older brother was a sawyer and would be a "guest
dogger" for an hour or so. That rig would cant for a gang saw and
put out 2,500 logs in a ten hour shift.</p>
<p>All of these statements can be verified, but I find it hard to
convince western lumbermen of these facts, and as I am now a man
of age 66 I grow weary of trying.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
