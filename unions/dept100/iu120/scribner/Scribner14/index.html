<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p><i>I (Tom Scribner) wrote this last summer (1965) especially
for this book.</i></p>
<p>So you get tired of running a dinky old newspaper, the Redwood
Ripsaw, and you figure you need a "vacation" away from the
coastal fog and other frustrations too numerous to mention. So,
it came to pass that I wrote a letter to Douglas Lumber
Corporation up at Truckee, California for a pond monkey job. The
"super", Nate Topal answered by saying, "Come up and go to work."
Arrived in Truckee in the midst of a spell of hot weather as its
thunder shower time in the Sierra</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../graphics/IU120/headwaters/logpon.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="179" width="230" />Monday, 8 AM comes the
moment of truth, so grabbing the old "bait can" and cork shoes we
head for the mill. Nate showed me the job and says, "Feed the
bull chain, break jackpots at the landing so the trucks have room
to dump."</p>
<p>"Just a minute Nate," I says, "what do you pay for all this
foolishness these days?" (I've been retired for 2 years); and the
man said,</p>
<p>"$2.38 per hour, starting." Well, I "started" 50 years ago and
this job was possibly, finishing, but I let that go, for the time
being, as I went to accumulate $400 in order to publish my book,
"Lumberjack", comes winter.</p>
<p>Well, first thing's first, so I better go break that jam at
the landing, and she's a lulu with about five or six truck loads
piled up and extending about 20 feet out into the pond, and piled
half way up the landing. Soyou go out to the face of the jam and
look 'er over. Looks easy: Take the old "fool killer" (Peavey)
and you get hold of the underwater log out front, twist 'er tail,
and the jam gives way, and how! By the Holy old Mackinaw the
whole works comes alive under your feet, and starts for the
middle of the pond with logs rolling, and under water logs
bursting to the surface and the whole thing sounds and feels like
an earthquake! This is a time to watch your step boy, or you
could fall in between them and became mincemeat!</p>
<p>The last of the logs has rumbled down from the landing so
hurry back before they get too far out in the pond, so you can
run back over these still rolling logs so you can jump off 'em
dry land. About then a glance at the bull chain shows you that
the log hungry son-of-a-gun has to be fed, so skip over there and
send up some logs. They are running piss fir, and it takes over
100,000 feet per day to keep them going, so it keeps you pretty
damn well occupied.</p>
<p>You have a block of wood to sit on, "when you have time". The
block is on a big stationary float next to the bull chain. You
make out fine and dandy in the AM as the wind doesn't get up
until afternoon. The logs just lay in close, and lazy like. The
whistle blows so you go up town for dinner. After dinner you come
back and discover that the wind has changed and the logs have all
drifted across the pond. (Note: the wind ALWAYS blows the wrong
way at EVERY sawmill. Seems like they PLAN it that way!)</p>
<p>So grab the old "idiot stick" (16 foot long aluminum pike
pole) walk around the edge of the pond until you can get out on
some timber. Line up a bunch of these "pecker poles" and then
start prying them over to the bull chain. You pry them over by
sticking the pike pole down to the bottom of the pond, and then
pry them over in the general direction of the bull chain. You
better have them lined up evenly, or you can't steer them. Not
only that, but the turn could break up, and you would have to
line them all up againif you had time. Nothing to it: just watch
your step or you will find out the hard way about that old adage,
"easy as falling off a log" and the guy that made THAT one up
wasn't just bumping his gums, by gum.</p>
<p>You have lots of time to think while you are poling logs
across the pond so you remember how it was in 1914. You got 26
bucks per MONTH for a 60 hour week as a swamper in the Minnesota
woods for Weyerhauser Timber Company. Way up bear Cloquet.
Sawyers and teamsters got a bit more. NOW look: you get near 20
bucks per day, and it's STILL only a living! Well, as the old
teamster told me one day, "we don't make MONEY, we make LUMBER.
Weyerhauser makes the MONEY!" That is still true!</p>
<p>Well, to hell with that; remember some of those old songs? "We
paid our debt to Lafayette, now who in hell do we owe?" "She's
true to me, and true to youand true to the rest of the army too,
Hinky dinky parley voo." Then there was that damned depression
song, "Wolf don't bother any more, he starved to death right by
my door." Cops, you know something else you old devil! These here
pecker poles gets smaller every year, meaning you have to be more
catty on 'em and at the same time you are getting older, and
slower, and by God you had better for sure or drown your fool
self! Well, I wasn't always a damn pond monkey. Before 1935 I
used to be a faller, and bucker, but then I had to go and buck a
log from the downhill side like a big Hoosiers, and the log
rolled over me and squeezed me out like when you step on a
toothpaste tube! God! That was over 30 years ago and you have
been a rafter and pond monkey ever since!</p>
<p>Just in case any of you renders should ever want to be a pond
monkey, here are a few fool proof rules to go by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never ride a lone log out beyond reach of other logs as you
just might run aground on a sinkerand have to swim back.</li>
<li>Always run zig-zag over the logs, and never, never zig when
you ought to zag!</li>
<li>Keep loose chunks of bark out of your corks, and watch for
loose bark on the logs.</li>
<li>Always wear wool underwear because no matter how cold and wet
you get, you are always warm and dry!</li>
<li>Watch your step when a load of logs is dumped into the
pondwaves! (Best time to break up a floating jam)</li>
<li>If you do fall in, don't try to climb out on the SIDE of a
log, as it just keeps turning. Climb out on the END of a
log.</li>
<li>If you are on nights, don't EVER light a cigarette while on a
log as the flash will blind you and you will fall in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on, and on, but why bother? Automation is doing
away with pond monkeys, just like it done away with rafters and
doggers and setters, and God knows WHAT they will do away with
next!</p>
<p>Bringing in a turn the other day, I just got to thinking about
my miserable social security. Lemme see now, I worked fifty years
in the timber so that's good for $80 per month. If I work ANOTHER
fifty years I should get $160. Oh no, hold on a bit there! Even
if you DID work another fifty you would only draw the tops which
is $127 per month! There MUST be a better way!</p>
<p>On the other hand there was my old dad. He worked 70 years in
the timberand died broke. Frustrating, ain't it?</p>
<p>Well, such is life on a Sierra Log Pond!</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
