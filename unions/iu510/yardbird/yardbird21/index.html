<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>What is the mark of a system out of control? Could it be when it takes
a suicidal direction? The dictionary defines suicide as "intentional
self-destruction." As you read this article I believe that you will agree
that "intentional self -destruction" clearly describes today's fishing
industry.</p>
<p>Not all that long ago the fishing fleet of the northwest would fish the
northern waters and then bring their catch into ports like Dutch Harbor,
Alaska for processing. Then the greedy bosses hit upon a new idea to
increase their profits, and to break the unions in the plants. That idea
was to put the processing factory on the ships. This idea led to the
fishing ships being built even larger than they had been before. In other
words they became floating factories. Seattle alone has a fleet of over 55
factory trawlers.</p>
<p>The owners of these ships are no longer small time operators, rather
they are owned by mega-corporations like Tyson, the giant Arkansas chicken
company, which owns 11 factory trawlers. This new fleet, in a matter of a
few years increased over-fishing from 39 over-fished stocks to the current
82% of all managed fished stocks which are fully or over-exploited, as
determined by the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>
<p>Now the capitalists realize that their "pot of gold" will run out if
they continue to fish at this rate, but capitalism being what it is,
rather than doing something to preserve and rebuild the fish stocks, they
are trying to increase the amount of the fish catch. Instead of building
even larger ships that will become obsolete in a few years, they are now
converting old freighters into factory trawlers. So, now, old "rust
buckets" are roving the seas sweeping them clean of sea life.</p>

<p>To make matters even worse, one company, All Alaskan Seafoods, took
this idea one step further. They are buying up old Russian freighters very
cheap and converting them into factories only, where a fleet of fishing
ships will bring them their catch and the factory ship will process the
fish and off load the "product" to another ship that takes it to port.
These ships will stay at sea up to six months at a time and will service
up to 125 fishing ships each.</p>
<p>This is where I come into the story. I have spent over 20 years working
on ships as a pipefitter, but, since Reagan let most of the U.S. merchant
marine reflag itself to get around environmental, health and safety laws,
and rid itself of union workers, the shipyards have not provided steady
work. About all that is left for people like me to work on are fishing
ships and ferryboats. So, not long ago I found myself working on two of
these converted freighters. One ship was called the <i>Ocean
Phoenix</i>.</p>
<p>"When the fish are coming in we are working 16 plus hours a day.
Throwing fish down shoots, casting back unwanted fish, and what we keep
are sliced and diced into everything from fish meal to the packaged fish
you buy in the store," my Chicano firewatch tells me. He went on to say
that the workers on the ship sign an 80-day contract and are paid a
percentage of the catch.</p>
<p>The <i>Ocean Phoenix</i> is the largest factory trawler in the U.S.
fishing fleet. It is over twice the size of the regular factory trawlers,
and like on other factory trawlers, the decks below main deck are working
factories, in the case of this ship some of the factory is even out on the
main deck. There you will find; cramped assembly lines of workers, long
conveyors, fish tanks, refrigeration compartments and a hell of a lot of
machines doing this, that and something else. Trawlers will lay out a net
as wide as a circumference of two miles and catch as much as 550,000 fish
a day. Once the catch is aboard, small fish and other sea life that is not
profitable - wrong sex, size or species - is thrown back into the ocean
dead. In 1994, the Seattle fleet dumped over 569 million pounds of dead
fish and over 15 million crabs. That comes out to one in every three fish
caught.</p>
<p>Back on the <i>Ocean Phoenix</i>, the firewatch continues to tell me
about the make-up of the crew and of the working conditions, as we have
some time to kill waiting for the welder to finish a weld so that I can
make the next fit up on the firemain. He spoke of coming up to Seattle
from East LA. a few years back and finding work on trawlers. These ships
are like microcosms of the overall racist society; the officers, engineers
and pushers are all white; the folks who do the real work are made up of
Hispanics, Filipinos, Blacks from the Caribbean and East Africa, Native
Americans and some poor whites (many of whom are biker types).</p>
<p>The ship carries a crew of around 300 people when it is at sea. When
the ship is at port waiting for the next season to open, it has a small
crew to do light maintenance, repair nets and work as fire watches for
workers like me who come aboard to repair the ship or put in new systems.
Living conditions on the ship start off with cramped living quarters that
make overcrowded prison cells look like luxury suites. The working
conditions are very dangerous, with speed-ups, long hours, and having to
do your factory work while the ship is rockin' and a rollin' in high seas.
I heard and saw numerous cases of physical abuse, and racial and sexual
harassment. Few workers on land would put up with the disrespectful and
degrading way the officers and pushers talk to the crew.</p>
<p>Few of these ships go into the shipyards for work, unless they have to
go into drydock. Most of the work on them is done by contractors who work
the ship wherever it is docked. Contractors bid on different work and the
contractor who is able to pay their workers the least amount of money and
cut the most comers (quality, safety and what not) gets the work. Those
who work for the contractors are really nothing more than skilled temp
workers. The contractor may only have a few days of work, or maybe a few
weeks or months; once the work is completed for one contractor, then it is
on to the next one that has work.</p>
<p>These are small companies with few full-time workers and no benefits.
They lack safety equipment and follow few health and safety laws. Unlike
the shipyards, where workers only work within their trade, the contractors
expect their workers to be able to do most everything. On the <i>Ocean
Phoenix</i>, I not only repiped the aft firemain, and put in a new fish
oil piping system, but I also put in a deck extension, a tank top and two
new bulkheads, all of which was shipfitter work.</p>
<p>Contract workers are forced to work long hours and then sometimes fared
with long lay offs. Work on the <i>Ocean Phoenix</i> started off at 10
hours a day, five days a week, but by the time the job was done we were up
to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. Though I made a few good contacts on
the <i>Ocean Phoenix</i>, I was not sorry to see that ship sail.</p>
<p>After taking a few days off, I worked a few weeks on a sternwheeler.
Then I was sent to a ship the likes of which I had never seen before. By
name it was called the <i>MN Rybak Chukotai</i>; the first of the Russian
ships that All Alaskan Seafoods was bringing over to the U.S. Four more
will be coming in to Seattle, and four will be going down to Louisiana. I
have worked all kinds of ships, from tramp steamers of nearly ever flag of
the world, to banana boats, and most every type of fishing ship there is,
but none of these ships came close to being as foul as the
<i>Rybak</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Rybak</i> was built in Gdansk, Poland in 1980. I have only
worked on a few ships built in Eastern Europe when it was a "workers'
paradise," and my general impression has been that these ships are far
inferior to other ships built around the world. The <i>Rybak</i> was the
first such ship that I was able to get a good look at (maybe too good of a
look at). Things that were standardized throughout the world in
shipbuilding do not apply to the <i>Rybak</i>. Primary, secondary and sub
structures are not square to each other, flanges not two holed, pipes not
uniform with each other or square to the structure. This makes the work of
pipefitters and shipfitters very hard. Though a ship is not a square,
everything upon that ship is built as if it were a series of squares, and
all angles are figured as degrees off square. Even with something that is
round in shape, the circumference is figured off what is square.</p>
<p>I have no idea how you could build a ship as poorly as the
<i>Rybak</i>. It was often commented by workers, that it must have taken a
lot of work to make things as fucked-up as they were on that ship. It
seemed as if the builders of this ship had neither the knowledge nor the
skills to build a proper ship.</p>
<p>Before the <i>Rybak</i> made its way to Seattle, it spent six years
unused at anchor in a port in Siberia. It seems that when Marxism fell in
Russia their maritime industry collapsed, and their merchant marine fleet
got mothballed. As one Russian crewmember told me, freedom came to mean
the lack of work, thus, the maritime workers also got mothballed. So
Russian maritime workers are forced to take any work they can find, no
matter how bad the conditions are.</p>
<p>When the <i>Rybak</i> first came into Seattle it was so foul that you
could smell the ship before you could see it. At first sight you would
have to ask yourself how something so rusted out could still float? It
looked as if it were a large bowl of light brown soup that had been
overfilled and the soup was spilling over its sides. Rust just poured out
of that ship. The closer you got to the ship the greater the smell got. If
you were one of the unlucky ones who had to go aboard the <i>Rybak</i> you
soon realized that it was not just one foul smell, but many different
disgusting odors. Nowhere on the ship could you get away from the smell.
Imagine, if you can, the combined smell of rotting fish and crabs, dead
rats and a sewage system that was completely backed up with human shit and
other foul things. The smell was so bad you could taste it, and the odor
would get into your hair and clothes. I had to burn incense in my car to
keep the smell out of it.</p>
<p>The ship was overrun with large rats. One crewmember told me that at
night you could hear them in the ductwork and the bulkheads. They tried to
bring on cats to deal with the problem, but they underestimated the rats.
The rats killed all of the cats. You had to be careful where you put your
hands for there were rattraps all over the place. I almost put my hand in
one when I was tracing out a pipe. About the most disgusting thing I have
ever seen was a rat that had chewed into a power line in one of the aft
compartments and there it was all rotting with the top of its head burned
off.</p>
<p>The <i>Rybak</i> was full of wild stories as different mysterious
things were found. Like the large compartment on the factory deck that had
bars welded across the portholes, as if that space was used to imprison
people. Then there were the bones found inside of a false wall that some
thought were human.</p>
<p>These once proud seamen had to live in these conditions. They also had
to endure the cold because the steam heating system did not work (that was
the system I worked on the most). All they had were small electric space
heaters. Even while the ship was in Seattle they had to live on it just to
make their small wages to send back to families they had not seen in over
a year.</p>
<p>The working conditions of us contract workers were almost as bad; be it
the smell, the live and dead rats, oily bilges, asbestos dust and so on.
At one point OSHA came in to test for asbestos in the air after they had
gotten a complaint. Unfortunately they did their test before work started
one morning and the dust had settled overnight. At the next so-called
safety meeting, we were told not to talk to OSHA or the fire marshals, and
that if we had a problem with something to come to them, the bosses.
Anyone dumb enough to do that would find themselves out of a job.</p>
<p>Being that the so-called unions don't want anything to do with contract
workers, we had to either put up with all this or move on to another job,
if we could find one. In one case that I know of that happened; a
pipefitter was sent down to an area with rotting crabs in it, after
smelling it he picked up his tools and walked off the job without telling
anyone. They sent another one down there and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>Jobs like this are dangerous because you have people working outside of
their trade and they use people with no experience to perform jobs that
only skilled people should be doing. Twice I was nearly hit because people
who were rigging did not know what they were doing and they gave no
warning when moving loads. I saved one young kid from braining himself
with a steel plate when he lost control of it because of bad rigging. One
worker got electrocuted because a lockout was not place on a system that
was being worked on.</p>
<p>Fire was a bad problem on the <i>Rybak</i>. We had three major fires
that forced us to evacuate the ship. One of these fires took four hours to
put out; while I was on the dock I counted 14 fire engines brought in to
fight it. The first problem was that the ship was a mess. Flammable
liquids stored any old place without warning signs, oxidizers next to
flammable, oily rags piled up in corners, and soon. Then there was the
foam which is used on most fishing ships as insulation, and it has a lower
flashpoint than gasoline, and when it bums it gives off cyanide gas. When
we had to do hotwork on bulkheads we were not allowed to strip off all the
foam first, only about a foot around the area of the work was taken off.
The bilges were so oily that when I had to bum out a pipe in them I could
only bum about an inch at a time before the firewatch had to put out the
fire.</p>
<p>Then there were the firewatches. Since there were between 400 to 500
contract workers on the <i>Rybak</i>, and only a few crewmembers could
speak English, All Alaskan had to hire a large number of firewatches. The
job of a firewatch is maybe one of the most boring jobs one could have,
yet it is one of the most important jobs on a ship.
Federal and state regulations state that when doing hotwork we must have
"competent" firewatches. Since all laws are written by liars and fools, no
one really knows what "competent" means. To All Alaskan it means hiring
people off the street, at minimum wage and not giving them any training.
To me it means realizing the importance of their work, paying them a real
wage, and training them so that they know the difference between the
classes of fire, how to put the fires out and a number of other
things.</p>
<p>The worst firewatches are those who know nothing about their job, but
are enthusiastic about doing it. They will shoot water onto power lines
and electrical boxes, not understanding that they could electrocute
someone or damage equipment. One time I was burning a hole in a deck and
no sooner had I finished the firewatch shot water up through the hole,
across the red-hot steel turning it into steam and burning my face. When
asked why he had done that he stated that the deck was red hot and he
wanted to cool it off.</p>
<p>After one inspection by the fire marshal in which All Alaskan was cited
for improper fire extinguishers, they realized that they could be held
responsible if something happened. Rather than train their firewatches
they passed the buck to us contract workers and made us responsible for
the firewatches, their equipment and their actions.
After the meeting in which they told us that, I checked out the fire
extinguisher of my firewatch. Every fire extinguisher states what class of
fire it is for and it has a rating, plus it is to be sealed. The rating
was lower than it should have been and it was not sealed. I asked him to
take it back and get another one, but he was told to use it anyway for
there were no more to be had. I told my boss and he said to keep on
working. Had something happened I would be the one blamed. There is that
old capitalist story again, always blame the workers when in fact the
blame lies in capitalist greed.</p>
<p>I was able to talk with one crewmember for a good while one day, and he
spoke rather depressing. words about the <i>Rybak</i> being 'the end of
the line' for workers like him. In his view, there was no lower point that
humans could fall to than to work on such a ship. In thinking about it, he
was not only speaking for the Russian seamen, but for all the workers upon
that ship. Of all the talk of the Marxists and Capitalists, of the
bleeding-heart liberals and other such liars and con artists, the fact is
that all current social/economic systems are dominated by a few on top,
issuing commands to those down the social/economic ladder. These systems
exist only for the self-interest of those on top.</p>
<p>The only gains we have made have come through the use of force, and any
time we let up on that force upon our masters we lose what little we have.
Because of the weakness of the modern resistance to exploitation, a
reactionary tide is sweeping over us, and for the working class this has
meant a freefall downwards.</p>
<p>As for the exploitation of the oceans, it is but another example of the
wrong direction humanity has taken. Whatever words influence you, be it
those of the scientists who warn of the rapid extinction of life, be it
the working-class militants who speak of the increased exploitation of
working people and of the world's resources, or be it the spiritual
warnings of the original people of this land, all of them have reached the
same conclusions; human society is heading in a suicidal direction.</p>
<p>Ten years ago I went out to Dineh and Hopi land with a group to
videotape elders on the issues surrounding the struggle at Big Mountain.
The elder woman of one family set up, in a traditional way, an interview
with Thomas Banyacya, a Hopi spiritual elder. After we completed that
interview he asked if we would return the next day. Nothing in my life
prepared me for what I heard that day. There is a kiva within an old
village where the three eldest Hopi spiritual people met each day. Sitting
upon the ladder going down into the kiva, where I could keep an eye out
for the police of the Mormon-controlled tribal council who would arrest us
if they found us there, I listened intently. They spoke of Hopi prophecies
that go back thousands of years, and of the wrong path that human society
has taken. They gave warning that if we did not return to the right path
that grave consequences would befall us all; and they explained in detail
what would happen. I could clearly see that they spoke the truth. For me
no other words are needed to explain what is going on and what we must do
about it.</p>
<p>But for those of you who need more, just last week there was an article
in the paper that put their words into scientific terms. A study compiled
by 1,500 scientists worldwide gave warning of extinction to the world.
These scientists, the engineers of the industrial monster, have come to
realize what the Hopi have known for thousands of years; that if we
continue as we are extinction will be the result. Within that study the
over fishing of the seas was one of the things they pointed out.</p>
<p>The work on the <i>Rybak</i> was not completed before it had to set
sail. Because I was not willing to sail that death ship to Siberia I was
laid off. Back when I was working on the <i>Ocean Phoenix</i> I issued a
flyer from the Industrial Transportation Project of the I.W.W. That flyer
explained the destruction of the oceans because of over fishing, and about
working conditions, and the need of working class solidarity to deal with
these problems. It also, explained that we need to stop blaming
environmentalists and Indian fishing treaty rights for the decline of the
fishing industry and that we should place the blame where it belonged, on
the greedy master class. I placed that flyer throughout both ships and one
Russia crewmember asked for copies to take back to Siberia with him. I
gave him 500 of them. My Chicano friend took another 500 copies to Dutch
Harbor with him.</p>
<p>The Eurocentric mind tends to isolate problems. Rather than see the
whole problem they divide it up into competing "issues." When looking at
the dangers that humanity faces, some point to environmental abuses as the
danger that may destroy us, others point to the weapons of mass
destruction, still others point to the way we treat each other. What the
Eurocentric minds fails to understand is that it is our society and its
wrong direction that will destroy us all. At the center of most Native
traditional beliefs is that all things are connected. Working those two
ships, for me, clearly showed the truth in that; the environmental abuse,
the exploitation of working people, racism, sexism and the overwhelming
greed of the capitalist class, are all symptoms of our rush to
extinction.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the way the capitalist treat working
people and the way they, treat Mother Earth. The capitalists feel they
have the right to exploit both. They will net the last fish, fall the last
tree, foul the last breath of clean air, and exploit working people to the
fullest extent possible in their madness driven by their lust for wealth
and power. It is for this reason that this system cannot be reformed. It
must be driven from the body of humanity, every aspect of it, every
thought pattern that justifies it, must be ground into dust so that it can
never again raise its evil head upon our world. Then we can rebuild our
world based upon the well being of all. But first we must come to realize
that our struggle of today is not just about better conditions or a more
humane economic system, it is also about the survival of all of us.</p>
