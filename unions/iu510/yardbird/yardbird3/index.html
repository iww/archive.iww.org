<p>Fate has always played strange games with me, putting me in places
where it seems I am meant to be. I had never planned on stopping in
Houston; I was on my way to Louisiana. But fate had other plans for me. As
it turned out, Houston was essential to my development as a pipefitter, a
rebel worker and as a person. After I was laid-off in Riverside, I found
out that a shipyard in Louisiana, called Avondale Shipyard, was recruiting
workers from all around the country. I called Avondale and asked about
work, and made a point of explaining what experience I had. They told me
to come on down, and they would give me a job. I had a little bit of money
saved, for I knew the importance of having a stake built up. With a
trailer hooked to the back of our '55 Chevy, we loaded up all that we
owned, three dogs, our baby daughter Val, my wife and me, and headed down
the road to Louisiana. The trip was going well until the ball joint
snapped on the driver's side front wheel. The wheel turned sideways and I
believe that the trailer was all that kept us from flipping over.</p>
<p>There we were, a pitiful sight, broken down and plum out of luck, 50
miles west of Houston. We got the old Chevy towed to the nearest garage.
The folks there were very understanding when they found that we did not
have enough money to fix the car. They let us store the car there until we
were able to come up with the needed cash. Then we made our way to
Houston.</p>
<p>In Houston two local old-time Wobblies, Gilbert Mers and Blackie
Vaughan helped us out. Damn, no wonder the bosses hated Wobblies, a union
that truly cares about its members.</p>
<p>Gilbert was a retired longshoreman, who had spent his life involved in
waterfront struggles of the Gulf Coast. He was one hell of a writer and
working-class thinker. One of the things that most impressed me about him
was how open he was to people who were different from him. Even though he
looked like someone's straight-laced grandfather, he wrote for the local
underground newspaper in the '60s. In later years he was the most
consistent writer for the publication I published called <i>Bayou La
Rose</i>.</p>
<p>His book, <u>Working The Waterfront: The Ups and Downs of a Rebel
Longshoreman</u> is, in my opinion, one of the best labor books ever
written. From the first page on you can tell the man knew what he was
writing about, for he had lived the words that he put upon paper. He was
wise beyond my understanding at that time, could analyze any given
situation and come up with a practical solution to whatever problems there
might be.</p>
<p>Gilbert encouraged me to take up writing about my labor experiences and
ideas. He told me to write about what I knew and experienced and to draw
my radical conclusions out of that. Most working stiffs, he said, don't
give a rat's ass about the line of talk from people who ain't never
experienced what they write about. The books of labor intellectuals are
mostly written for other labor intellectuals. If you want to speak to real
working stiffs then get down into their reality. Because of Gilbert I have
gone on to write numerous job related articles and pamphlets, and it would
be a true statement to say that without Gilbert's influence these words
you read may never have been written.</p>
<p>Blackie was a long-time seaman, many would say he was the rebel spirit
of the Gulf Coast Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union 510 (MTW) of
the IWW. He was a man of action, and few words. When I landed in Houston
he was in his 80s and still tending bar at a seamen's dive. He walked with
a limp from an old gunshot wound in his hip, but he could still bounce a
drunk, ill-mannered seaman out the door if needed. That did not happen
often, for there were few seamen who did not have a lot of respect for
Blackie.</p>
<p>Among seamen Blackie was a living legend. Many tales are still told
among Gulf Coast seamen of that defiant Wobbly who always stood up to the
employers and the union bosses anytime a worker had been wronged. But no
matter how tough he may have seemed, he always had a kind heart and a
helping hand for any worker in need. Though seamen loved him, the
employers and the union bosses feared him as if he were Lucifer himself.
His days as a seaman ended when the seamen's union blacklisted him and he
was unable to ship out anymore. That's when he started to tend bar. He
continued his Wobbly activities as the MTW Houston delegate. Even though
the Wobblies had fallen on hard times, seamen continued to pay dues to
him, out of their great respect for him, until he died.</p>
<p>Blackie let us use an extra room he had until we could get back on our
feet. He also hooked us up with another Wobbly who worked in the machine
shop at a nearby ship repair company.</p>
<p>As in many ship repair companies in the south, only a few workers had
fulltime jobs: the rest of the workers showed up at the beginning of the
shift for what is called a "shape-up", and the foreman would pick the
number of workers he needed on that day. For the first few weeks I got all
the work I could handle. I was able to get the old Chevy repaired and back
to Houston. When work slacked off we moved just outside of Houston to
Green's Bayou, which was close to Todd Shipyard where I landed a job.</p>
<p>It may seem a bit of a strange statement to make, but busting that ball
joint was one of the luckiest things to ever happen to me. First off, it
turned out that the shipyard that I was heading for, Avondale, was one of
the worst shitholes in the country to work at, and staying in Houston
became a great learning experience for me -- I was able to learn what true
labor struggles were all about from Gilbert, Blackie and another old time
Wobbly seaman, Fred Hanson; and I was able to learn my trade at Todd
Shipyard.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
