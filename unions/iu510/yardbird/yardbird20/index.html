<p>Steel constructed nightmares sailing the oceans of the world. Death
ships, the birth child of the "new global economy". Oil spills, running
around, sinking of rust buckets, crews forced to work at low wages that is
when they are paid at all, long hours, death and injury at sea, and
sometimes abandoned without food or water, are we talking about the modern
world here? Yes we are! The nightmare is called "Flag Of Convenience.
(FOC) ships. A growing form of greed upon the oceans that few people
outside of the maritime industry know little about.</p>
<p>Though FOC ships have been around for a while, but in the new wave of
global capitalist expansionism the increase of FOC ships has greatly
increased. Like the landslide global capitalist onslaught of exploitation,
the environment, human rights, organized labor and common dignity have
been cast aside by the greed of but a few worthless parasites upon the
seas as well. They are grinding our world in to the dust in order to
produce profit. The once proud maritime fleets of the world are becoming
an object of shame. When viewed as a whole and seeing the effects
Lindsay's Maritime Law seems to speak of the direction the maritime
industry is heading; "When your draft exceeds the water's depth, you are
most assuredly aground". The maritime industry and the health of the
oceans are being run aground upon the shallow waters of industrial
greed.</p>
<p>I first became aware of FOC ships while working ship repair. These were
the ships that we had to work on that all of us would have rather not ever
board. They were all rust buckets that were not maintained and the only
work done on them was what had to be done out of necessity.</p>
<p>I have worked on FOC ships of all kinds; tankers, general cargo ships,
bulk carriers and cruise ships to name a few. I have seen first hand the
terrible conditions these ships are really in and I have talked to many
crewmembers and heard their stories that seem like tales from a different
era.</p>
<p>When I found that few outside of the maritime industry knew little
about FOC ships, that is when I decided to do some research on them and
write about what I found. Though I was able to find some information in
the newspapers, the bulk of the information I found came from the
International Transport Workers Federation (ITF). My first exposure to ITF
came when the ITF ship <i>Global Mariner</i> came to Tacoma. The <i>Global
Mariner</i> is a floating exhibition on FOC ships and the plight of their
crews.</p>
<p>I found out that the ITF has a global campaign on the issue of FOC
ships that includes; inspections and advocacy of the improved condition of
seafarers on FOC ships that even includes international days of action.
The following information will give you a limited view of the problems
that FOC have created in the maritime industry. Still there is enough
information here to get a good understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>A "Flag Of Convenience" (FOC) ship is a ship where the nationality of
the owner is different from the country in which the ship is registered.
Countries that offer registration of ships owned by foreign interests are
considered to have what is called an "open register". Foreign owned ships
dominate the flags of "open register" countries.</p>
<p>The modern origin of open registries can be traced back to the 1920s,
when the United Fruit Company created the Honduran open registry to ensure
the cheap and reliable transport of its bananas. The Panamanian open
registry came about soon after that because U.S. flagged passenger ships
wanted to serve liquor during Prohibition. The Liberian open register came
about during the "Cold War" because the U.S. wanted a fleet of "neutral"
ships to haul its cargo, mostly oil.</p>
<p>Some times it is even hard to trace down the real owners a FOC ship.
Often in the register country the address for the ship owners will only be
a Post Office Box. From there you must follow a series of front companies,
often in different countries, before you end up finding the real owners of
a FOC ship.</p>
<p>Many large American shipping lines like the American President Lines
are leaving U.S. flags and are becoming FOC ships. In 1998 there were 28
open register countries of FOC ships and 19,270 vessels over 100 GT, which
comes to 22.5% of the world's fleet and in that year there was a 8.5%
increases in FOC ships.</p>
<p>Of the top 35 maritime countries based on real ownership of vessels not
one of them is an open register country. For example, the true nationality
of ownership of ships from Greece that are part of open register fleets
(percentage of open register fleets) are as follows: Liberia 12.4%, Panama
11.1 %, Cyprus 72.6%, Bahamas 19.0% and Malta 56.3%.</p>
<p>Of the top six fleets of gross tonnage in 1998, five of them are open
registers for FOC ships; Panama (6,188 vessels), Liberia (1,697 vessels),
Bahamas (1,221 vessels), Cyprus (1,650) and Malta (1,378). The U.S. fleet
ranks 11th in gross tonnage. Of the top six fastest growing fleets in
percentage of gross tonnage, includes four other open registers of FOC
ships; Cayman Islands, Cambodia, Belize, and Antigua/Barbuda. This comes
to 51.3% of the world's gross tonnage carried on FOC ships.</p>
<p>Each year the numbers above keep growing at an alarming rate. The
reason for this is that there is greater profit in sailing FOC ships for
the ship-owners. The following are the reasons for this: Easy entry to and
exit from open registers; low taxes or no taxes levied on shipping; the
governments of open registered countries lack the power or willingness to
impose national or international standards which allows FOC ships to avoid
health, safety, environmental and ship maintenance regulations; avoid
union ship crews; hire ship crews from the most economically depressed
nations; helps suppress ship crews grievances; and in some cases allows
for true ship-owners to avoid economic responsibility for such things as
environmental damage, shipping accidents, and payment of ship crew's
wages.</p>
<p>FOC ships make up two-thirds of all ocean pollution case sited by the
U.S. Coast Guard. In one year the U.S. Coast Guard sited 78 cases of ship
pollution from Panama FOC ships; only 18 were investigated by Panama and
10 were fined.</p>
<p>Of the top 20 flags of lost vessels at sea in 1998 the top five were
open registered, 10 out of 20 were also open registered, 53 ships lost out
of 74 were FOC ships. Between 1992 and 1995 Panamanian open register lost
a total of 89 ships at sea.</p>
<p>The ITF says that at least 2,200 seafarers die each year at sea and
that crews on FOC ships are more than twice as likely to get killed on the
job. The families of seafarers that die on FOC ships most of the time do
not receive a penny in compensation from the ship-owners, The
International Maritime Organization reported that the top ten flags
detained after port state control inspections throughout the world include
8 open registries, and of that top ten 1,196 detained ships out of
1,479.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard in Lake Charles found 32 major deficiencies on two
small Belizean freighters -- the <i>Velda</i> and the <i>Marwil</i> --
alone in the same month. Those two ships were issued pollution prevention
and vessel safety certifications by the International Shipping Bureau of
Miami, even though there were wasted cargo-hold frames on the
<i>Marwil</i> and holes in the <i>Velda's</i> superstructure. The Coast
Guard believes that many FOC ships are being certified without inspections
and that they are just being sold without ever having even seen the
ships.</p>
<p>In just one year the FOC ships registered in Malta had 207 detained
ships which included the numbers of deficiencies sited of: safety in
general, 135; fire fighting appliances, 133; life saving appliances, 129;
navigation, 92; marine pollution, 70; load lines, 64; propulsion, 52; crew
accommodations, 38; radio, 36; operational deficiencies, 18.</p>
<p>The consequences of ships maintained so poorly are seen in the papers
all the time with accidents and oil spills. One such accident that got
worldwide publicity happened on the Mississippi River down in New
Orleans.</p>
<p>On Dec. 15, 1996, the Liberian FOC ship 70,000-ton freighter <i>Bright
Field</i> lost power and much of its ability to steer rammed into a busy
shopping mall on the New Orleans riverfront, gouging up 200 feet of steel
and concrete. There were 116 people who were injured. Because of the
actions of the crew and the river pilot the ship just missed, by 70 feet,
a floating casino packet with people. They did that by dropping the anchor
and had they not been able to do that hundreds of people would have been
killed.</p>
<p>Ironically when I lived down in New Orleans another Liberian FOC ship
lost steering and plowed into the New Orleans waterfront on its way up
river. After it was repaired and loaded up river, on its way down river it
again lost steering a collided with a sternwheeler in which after that I
worked on the repair crew.</p>
<p>The <i>M/V Jahan</i> (Belize FOC registered) was reported sunk in the
South Atlantic Ocean in good weather, and all 28 crewmembers were reported
lost. A distress call reported, "uncontrollable flooding" and that the
crew, mostly Bangladeshi citizens, would be forced to abandon ship. The
distress call was not a general call but rather was a normal telex sent to
the ship-owners. The ship had an Inmarsat C system that was not used.
Australian Marine Rescue, the South African Air Force and three bulk
carriers searched for the ship and found nothing. Later the ship
resurfaced in Tema, Ghana displaying a different name. It seems that the
ship had a lean on it and it sought to fake its own sinking.</p>
<p>In 1998 the top 20 flags that ITF Actions Unit handled crew complaints
included 11 open registers of which there were 1,197 out of 1,597
complaints. These complaints included: abandonment of seafarers,
substandard living conditions, substandard ships, victimization, unfair
dismissals, medical treatment, overtime and delayed wages.
Wages paid to seafarers is a major reason for FOC ships; for example the
estimated monthly cost of a 24-member crew (officers and unlicensed
seafarers) of Europeans is $80,100, and for a Chinese crew $21,900. 18% of
FOC crews get paid less than $500 a month. 68% are paid less than $1,200 a
month and 6% of all FOC crews are owned back wages. On most FOC ships
stowaways (often escaping political repression or for economic reasons)
are used as slave labor and do not receive any wages.</p>
<p>The following is one good example of the conditions of FOC ships. The
Coast Guard detained the Greek-owned FOC bulk carrier the <i>Fontini</i>
after they found no working pump for fighting fires, lifeboat space for
only 26 of the 40 men aboard and the crew complained of kidney and lower
back pains from having to drink foul water.</p>
<p>Ships are very complex workplaces and the level of alertness is very
important. For it has been shown that human factors were a critical part
in at least 80% of shipping accidents. With the general reduction of the
size of ship crews, the increase number of hours they work, and the
increase length of tours away from home (many in the excess of a year)
fatigue has become a dangerous increasing factor. The physical and
psychological effects of fatigue include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of concentration and diminished decision making ability.</li>
<li>Loss of alertness and extended reaction time.</li>
<li>Impaired coordination of control skills.</li>
<li>Tiredness, depression and irritability.</li>
<li>Poor sleep quality and disrupted sleep patterns.</li>
<li>Loss of appetite, gastro-intestinal problems.</li>
<li>Increased risk of infection.</li>
<li>Higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.</li>
<li>Increased accident and mortally rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers have found that long hours worked are similar to the effect
of blood-alcohol leaves higher than those allowed in the operation of any
vehicles. But on FOC ships there are no standards of length of hours
worked though there are for blood-alcohol leaves even though they both
pose the same danger.</p>
<p>Sleep time is also limited by other factors: noise, cargo working,
alarms, safety drills, vibration, machinery, PA announcements; call-outs
while off -watch and poor weather. The working patterns of many seafarers
run against the bodies natural rhythms and along with the other factors
listed about, leave many seafarers with almost permanent 'jet lag' type
symptoms.</p>
<p>The following are two examples of where fatigue was the major factor in
accidents:</p>
<ul>
<li>From a report of a shipmaster; "During port operations, I was serving
as chief officer and had worked continuously for 48 hours. I contributed
to a chemical overflow in which serious injury occurred by not
concentrating on the loading operation. Acrylonitrile overflowed and
covered two men when I hot-washed an adjacent tank."</li>
<br />
<li>A cargo ship that collided with an oil tanker after the officer
keeping watch - who had obtained only 2.5 hours sleep in the preceding 33
hours - fell asleep. Many FOC ships are nothing more than rust buckets
that are run as cheaply as possible. That means little maintenance of the
ships. When these ships are detained for the purpose of repairs, pollution
responsibility and different forms of liability, it has become a common
practice of the FOC ship-owners to abandon ships. This leaves the ship's
crew stranded in a foreign port, many times without food, drinking water,
medicine, heat and owed wages, often for many months on end.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1998 the ITF handled 66 cases (1997 - 78 cases and 1996 - 110 cases)
of abandonment of seafarers. ITF recorded 199 cases of different ships
where their crews were abandoned. Of the cases reported to the ITF 54% in
1998 and 70% in 1997 were FOC ships. In 1998 this amounted to 371
seafarers abandoned by FOC ships in 1998. The worst offending open
registers were Malta, Panama, St. Vincent, Cyprus and Honduras. The two
worst non-open register flags were Singapore and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of abandon FOC ships in 1999:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FOC Maltese flagged <i>MN Verona</i> was left stranded in the port
of Hamburg, Germany after it was detained for technical deficiencies. The
Polish and Filipino crew was left without food or water, and the Swedish
owners had not paid the crew for over 5 months.</li>
<br />
<li>The crew of the <i>MN Terpsichore</i> (Maltese FOC flag) were abandon
in the Port of Mongla, Bangladesh without food, clean drinking water and
electricity. Because of the appalling conditions crewmembers were in poor
health and there was an outbreak of hepatitis. Because the crew had not
been paid in 10 months they were forced to sell their belongings to buy
food.</li>
<br />
<li>The crew of the <i>Queen of Vevey</i> (Panamanian FOC flag), made up
of Russian and Ukrainian seafarers, was abandon at anchorage at Port
Stanley in the Falkland Islands in unsanitary conditions. The ship was
said to be "unseaworthy". The crew remained unpaid and a local Seamen's
Mission was supplying them with food and water. The ship was sold and
changed its name to the <i>Maimad</i> and reflagged to the FOC St. Vincent
register. The authorities of the Falkland Islands did little to help
because, as they stated "it is only too likely that unscrupulous
ship-owners would be encouraged to abandon their vessels there..."</li>
<br />
<li>The Burmese crew of the <i>Brahm</i> (Maltese FOC flag) was abandoned
off the coast of Lagos, Nigeria for almost six months. They were forced to
cook and clean with river water and became stricken with tropical
diseases. Several crewmembers became so ill that they had to be
transported to a hospital. The crew also had not been paid.</li>
<br />
<li>The Ukranian crew of the <i>Alcor</i> (Maltese FOC flag) was abandoned
in the St. Lawrence River off of Quebec City, Canada after it ran aground.
The reason it ran around was that it suffered a rudder breakdown. The
vessel had vertical crack in the hull running from deck to water level.
The crew had not been paid in months.</li>
<br />
<li>The Sri Lankan, Ukrainian and Romanian crew of the <i>Elijeanne</i>
(Panamanian FOC flag) were abandoned in Port Au Prince, Haiti. The crew
was forced to sleep in alleyways and on hatch covers. The vessel was
infested with mosquitoes that led to an outbreak of malaria. The crew also
had not been paid.</li>
<br />
<li>The crew of the <i>MN Endurance</i> (Belizean FOC flag) was abandoned
in the Port of Maputo, Mozambique. The captain left the ship without food,
water or fuel for electricity. The crew had not been paid wages in
months.</li>
<br />
<li>The crew of mixed nationality from Central America and Asia of the
<i>MN Ocean Wave</i> (Panamanian FOC flag) were abandoned in Mongla,
Bangladesh after the ship went aground. Because of serious structural
deficiencies and the likelihood of the ship breaking up, the crew left the
ship and were placed in custody by Bangladesh authorities. There they
waited for their wages.</li>
<br /><li>The Pakistani crew of the <i>Normar Pride</i> (Panamanian FOC
flag) was abandoned in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles without food, water
and their wages.</li>
<br /><li>The crews of the sister ships oil tankers <i>Luigi S</i> and
<i>Zagara</i> were abandoned after another sister ship the <i>Erika</i>
(all three are Maltese FOC flagged) broke up and sank in the Bay Biscay,
polluting the Brittany beaches with heavy fuel oil. The crew of the
<i>Luigi S</i> was abandoned in Montenegro, and the crew of the
<i>Zagara</i> was abandoned in Sicily. The crews had not been paid in over
a year. The abandonment came about out of the ship-owners wanting to cut
their assists and avoid responsibility for the costs of the pollution of
the <i>Erika</i>.</li>
<br />
<li>The crew of the <i>Karteria</i> (Maltese FOC flag) was abandoned in
the Port of Antwerp, Azores after a horrific explosion that left two dead
and another with a broken back with 30% burns. That crewmember was left in
a hospital that could not treat him until the ITF intervened. The rest of
the crew was abandon with an unstable cargo that continued to emit
explosive quantities of hydrogen gas.</li>
<br />
<li>The Pakistani crew of the <i>Delta Pride</i> (Maltese FOC flag) was
abandoned off the coast of South Padre Island, Texas for over 10 months.
The ship had its papers and the seafarer's passports confiscated after the
owner skipped out of dues by going bankrupt. The SOS calls from the crew
were ignored and they ran out of fuel, thus not power for lights and
cooking. They had to save rainwater, for they had run out of fresh water
and they had to fish in order to eat. The crew became malnourished and
sick from having to drink dirty water.</li>
</ul>
<p>86% of the personal injury and loss of life claims handled by ITF in
1998 were from FOC ships.</p>
Most seafarers on FOC ships are recruited by shipping agents (job sharks)
and are forced to sign over their first month's wages to these employment
agents. If any of them express any grievance or speak of unions they
become blacklisted for future employment at sea.<p></p>
<p>Having worked on FOC cruise ships I have often wondered if those well
off passengers have any understanding of the reality of these ships. The
passengers see an American owned cruise ship company and falsely believe
that U.S. maritime laws protect them. But if the ship is registered in an
open register country, then it is the standards of that country that ship
follows. When some type of accident happens the liability that ship faces
is found in the country of register and not the country of ownership.</p>
<p>In 1998, 59% of cruise ship passengers were American and 26% were
European. Two open registers made up 52.5% of capacity of passengers;
Liberia ((28.5%) and Panama (24%). Other open registers have the bulk of
the rest of the passengers with only two non-FOC flags included in the top
8.</p>
<p>Kathy Lee Gifford became very upset when the public found out that she
clothing line was produced in sweatshops. She shed her crocodile tears and
pretended to try to make emends. While at the same time she promoted
floating sweatshops in her "If you could see me now..." Carnival Cruise
Line commercials that fail to point out that those ships are all FOC
registered (Bahamas, Panama and Liberia). Carnival Cruise Lines is the
Kathy Lee Fashions of the maritime industry.</p>
<p>The following are some examples are of some of the troubles FOC cruise
ships have run into:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FOC Bahamian registered <i>Starward</i> ran aground while drifting
offshore awaiting to arrive in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. It
suffered damage to the propellers and spilled hydraulic oil into the sea.
The ship ran aground at the base of a 150-foot cliff. How could they have
not have seen it? Because of the unprofessionally of the bridge watch that
depended upon their global positioning system (GPS) only.</li>
<br />
<li>The Canard-owned (FOC) <i>Royal Viking Sun</i> ran aground on a coral
reef off of Egypt and was seized to pay for damages. A few months before
that the Owned-owned (FOC) <i>Saga Fjord</i> was destroyed by fire in the
Philippines.</li>
<br />
<li>The Panamanian (FOC registered) <i>Royal Majesty</i> ran aground 10
miles off Nantucket Island because the bridge watch had the ship on
autopilot guided by a GPS that had failed.</li>
<br />
<li>The Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world's second largest cruise line
and FOC registered, pleaded guilty to routinely dumping oil and hazardous
chemicals from nine of it's ships in U.S. waters. The company admitted it
had dumped toxic solvents in New York Harbor; had dumped oil and toxic
chemicals in Miami, the Virgin Islands, Los Angeles and the Inside Passage
in Alaska; and had repeatedly lied to the Coast Guard. This guilty plea
came just one month after the company had be found guilty of other dumping
charges and had promised to stop polluting, and two years after pleading
guilty in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Miami to obstruction of justice, a
fleet wide conspiracy to dump oil and lying to the Coast Guard. After all
of this the company issued a press statement saying all the dumping was
just a "mistake."</li>
<br />
<li>The FOC registered cruise ship <i>Discovery</i> had a major engine
room fire while returning to Port Everglades, Fl. Though there was never
an alarm sounded, the passengers found themselves enveloped in smoke.
Engine room workers had reported a fuel-line leak to their supervisor
hours before the fire but they did not have it repaired. The leak got so
bad that they had to use large buckets to catch the streams of oil.
Guatemalan crewmembers that told the truth about the leak were fired.</li>
<br />
<li>Another Discovery Cruise Line ship caught fire off Freeport, Texas
only six days after failing a Coast Guard fire drill. Again the fire was
the result of a fuel line leak that had been reported and not repaired and
again those crewmembers that spoke the truth were fired.</li>
<br />
<li>The <i>Scandinavian Star</i> (Bahamian FOC) catches on fire 60 miles
north of Cancun, Mexico and sustained $3.5 million in damages. The NTSB's
report criticized the firefighting equipment, engine-room maintain and
that a lack of common language among the crew hindered their ability to
communicate with each other and the passengers in the emergency situation.
Two years later the same ship catch on fire in the North Sea in which
flames and toxic fumes killed 158 people. 99 people died in their cabins.
Escape routes were hard to follow and some corridors led to dead ends. In
two such dead ends 20 bodies were found.</li>
<br />
<li>The Carnival owned <i>Celebration</i> (Liberian FOC ship) 733-foot
cruise ship rammed the <i>Capitan San Luis</i>, a 352 foot Cuban bulk
carrier off the coast of Cuba. It sliced the Cuban ship in two, killing
three crewmembers and injuring 13. The "accident" happened in good
visibility and the cruise ship had the most modern, automatic radar
system, but no one was monitoring the radar. A federal judge in Miami
quashed the investigation after deciding that the NTSB had no authority
over the foreign registered ship. Later when the same ship caught on fire
near San Salvador Island in the Bahamas, the cause was mechanical
failure.</li>
<br />
<li>The <i>Golden Princess</i> (Bahamian FOC ship) caught on fire bounded
for Vancouver, B.C. from San Francisco. The ship had to be towed to
Victoria, B.C. * The Universe Explorer (Panamanian FOC ship), en route
from Juneau to Glacier Bay, Alaska caught on fire. Five crewmembers died
and 76 passengers were injured.</li>
<br />
<li>The 30,000-ton <i>Sun Vista</i> caught fire in the main engine room
and sunk off the coast of Malaysia. It was two hours after the fire broke
out that the first distress signal was sounded. All power went out and the
emergency lights never came on. Smoke flowed through the air-conditioning
vents into cabins and passageways. The passengers and crew were all
covered with soot as left the ship in 18 lifeboats and 4 rafts. As they
watched the ship sink below the waters they sung the theme song from the
1998 movie "Titanic."</li>
<br />
<li>The Carnival Cruise Lines ship <i>Ecstasy</i> caught fire shortly
after it leaving the Port of Miami, generating huge clouds of dark smoke.
60 people were reported injured, most for smoke inhalation. The fire was
contained to the aft section of the ship as the crew closed fire doors to
keep it from spreading. Had the ship been on the high seas rather than
just two miles out of port the situation would have been far worse than it
had been. Many passengers stated that they smelled smoke long before any
alarm was sounded. The owners at a press conference tried to put the blame
on two welders, but the facts came out that they had not yet begun to work
when the fire started. The was not the first major fire aboard this ship,
an electrical fire broke out in the engine room forcing the shut down of
one of its engines, as it was returning to Miami on an earlier
voyage.</li>
<br />
<li>Royal Caribbean (Liberian FOC) ship the <i>Legend of the Seas</i>, ran
aground off Catalina Island, The Dominican Republic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cruise ship industry is working to repeal the U.S. Passenger
Services Act that prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying passengers
between U.S. ports. The repeal of this law would mean that an industry
that pays not taxes in the U.S., has underpaid workers from other
countries, gets around health, safety and environmental laws and are
floating union busters would then be able to sail from U.S. ports to other
U.S. ports. The main backer of the repeal campaign is Sen. Strom
Thurmond.</p>
<p>Some may read what I have written and think; "This sounds terrible, but
FOC ships do not affect me personally, so why should I try to do something
about it?" Maybe if you never go out on the seas and have to worry about
the condition of the ship your on or if another ship rams into it. Maybe
if you do not live by the oceans and oil spills and the intentional
dumping of hazardous chemicals may not directly affect you. Maybe you view
the protection of the environment as someone else's problem. Maybe you
feel that the rights of working people to organize, have safe jobs and to
better their conditions has no bearing on your economic conditions.</p>
<p>Maybe you do not see that gaining basic human rights for all is
directly connected to your human rights. Maybe as a taxpayer you do not
care if others who make great wealth pay no taxes. Maybe you live in a
bubble, isolated from humanity and the environment that the rest of us
depend upon for survival. Then maybe FOC ships are not your concern.</p>
<p>In the real world we do not live in isolation unaffected by what
happens to others and what happens to the environment. In the real world
all things are connected. When the basic human rights of some are threaten
then the basic human rights of all are threaten. How far the forces of
greed are willing to go for the accumulation of their wealth is a direct
indication of how great a threat they are to all of us. The new wave of
global corporate expansionism and domination affects every one of us no
matter where we live.</p>
<p>When the environment is damaged, that damage does not stop and
recognize political borders. The waters of the oceans flow pass the
imaginary lines in the waters declaring national boundaries. The health of
our world's oceans is directly tied into the environmental health of our
planet.</p>
<p>Each of us is directly tired into FOC ships because we consume the
goods that are transported upon those ships. That gives each of us a
responsibility for what is going on, and it gives each of us a source of
power to do something about it. We should not just boycott FOC ships and
state that all ships should sail the flag of the "better" countries,
because those seafarers upon those ships have a right to work as much as
any seafarer of any country.</p>
<p>What is needed is a declaration of the rights of all seafarers that
includes the rights of all to a clean and safe environment. That
declaration should be the basis of the unionization of all seafarers.</p>
<p>Those ship-owners who do not abided to that declaration should have
their ships boycotted along with the goods transported upon them. That
means as workers we do not handle boycotted ships; they would not be
loaded or unloaded, they would not be serviced or repaired. The goods from
these ships would not be handled in anyway by working people, in
transportation or in any production use of those goods. As consumers we
would not consume any products by companies that use FOC ships to
transport their cargo.</p>
<p>There is also a need of a massive public campaign to educate the public
about FOC ships. Those who live in port towns should make it known that
FOC ships are not welcomed in their port. While at the same time make it
clear that they are also there to support the seafarers that are
victimized by those ships.</p>
<p>The rich corrupt employers recognize no limitations on what they see as
their right to exploit all that is exploitable. They are organized
internationally in their own interests and they control most all
governments. We, the working people of the world must come to understand
that we must also organize in our own self-interests on an international
level and stand in universal solidarity with each other. This is the only
way we will ever be able to turn the tide away from the exploitation of
all to the well-being of all.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
