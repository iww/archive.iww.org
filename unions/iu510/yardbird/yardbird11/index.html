<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>After settling into New Orleans, I went to work at a small yard for a
while, but this did not last very long because the yard was full of with
"good old boys" who treated those outside of their clique as something
less than they were. I was rather vocal about this treatment and was let
go after three months. I then went to work as a burner in a scrap yard for
a few months.</p>
<p>Not knowing anyone in New Orleans I looked up the few local Wobblies,
and I found that there was a small community of radicals that included
Wobblies, an assortment of anarchists, a few MNSers (Movement for a New
Society), and other radicals. I also found out that a few of the Wobblies
and anarchists worked at a place called Dixie Machine.</p>
<p>Dixie, along with two other companies did direct ship repair. They had
daily hire and fire with a shape-up at the beginning of every shift. From
the shape-up they would pick the number of workers that were needed for
each shift; so I started to show up at the night shift shape-up. It took a
while before I was able to get much work because they did not know what I
could do. Once they found out that I knew how to fit pipe I was able to
get all the work that I wanted.</p>
<p>Most of the work at Dixie was out on the Mississippi River from Venice
(Venice is as far down the river as you can get by road) all the way up to
Baton Rouge (which is as far up the river as ships can go). Within this
area we would be sent out to work on ships that need some type of repair
done. This included general cargo docks (mostly in New Orleans), the
container terminal (again in New Orleans), grain terminals (that were
scattered on the river from just south of New Orleans to just south of
Baton Rouge), the coal terminal in Port Sulphur, chemical plants (they
lined the river from Norco to south of Baton Rouge - an area known as
cancer ally), the Exxon refinery (in Baton Rouge) and an assortment of
little terminals and docks. Often we would go down to a place called Nine
Mile Point where non-U.S. flag ships anchored waiting for either dock
space or to be inspected by Coast Guard. We got a good deal of work
because of the Coast Guard inspections, for a ship could not move if the
Coast Guard found violations and we were sent there to fix those
violations.</p>
<p>Often we would catch a ship going up or down the river. We would get
out to the ship by riding the launches, small boats that transport people
and supplies to ships that were not docked. Getting from the launch to the
ship was always an interesting experience. For reasons unknown to me
foreign flagships would, most of the time, lower their gangway and we
would struggle up it with our tools and material, but U.S. ships would not
do this. They would lower down a Jacob's ladder. A Jacobs's ladder is two
ropes with wooden ruts tied in between them. You cannot carry anything
with you up a Jacob's ladder, for it is all you can do to hold on and
climb the damn thing.</p>
<p>The worst situation was when you were trying to board a ship that was
sailing up river in rough water. The launch would be trying to match the
ship's speed while bouncing up and down in the rough water and trying not
to run into the ship. As this was going on you had to grab onto the
Jacob's ladder without going for a swim. The ruts of the ladder were only
six inches wide so your footing was always a bit treacherous. Now image
doing all this in the middle of a heavy rainstorm with the wind seemingly
trying to blow you off the hull of the ship. While I worked at Dixie we
never lost anyone, but I heard stories of river pilots boarding ships
going up river at Pilots Town, and falling in the river never to be seen
again.</p>
<p>The process of making the needed repairs accrued in the following
manner. Either the day shift or the night shift would go out to the ship
and remove the pipes that needed to be replaced and bring them into the
shop. There they would be placed into a target where the old pipe would be
removed and the new pipe would be built in the target. If the pipe was off
a foreign ship we would have to cut the flanges off and reuse them,
because foreign ships use metric measurements and the U.S. ships do not.
The flanges would be sent over to be sandblasted and then the machine shop
would bore them out to fit U.S. pipe.</p>
<p>Dixie was a very old company that started in the ship repair business
before the Civil War. This meant that they still did some things the
old-fashion way. One example of this was that they had no pipebenders;
instead they bent pipe the old way. This meant you first had to fill up
the pipe to be bent with sand. Then a worker would take a mallet and beat
on the pipe until the sand was packed in very tightly. On titanium pipe it
would take many hours of beating on the pipe before the sand was compacted
enough for the pipe to be bent. Then the pipe would be dogged down on a
slab and heated up until it was red-hot, then it would be bent. On larger
pipe a big blow torch and a wench would be used.</p>
<p>Once the pipes were done the next shift would take them out to the ship
to be installed. Given that the ship was out on the river somewhere, we
had to make sure that we had everything we needed. We would always bring
extra hardware (nuts and bolts) because you are bound to lose a few down
in the bilge. We called that "feeding the bilge Gods".</p>
<p>Sometimes we were unable to bring the pipes that needed to be replaced
to the shop; for example, when the ship was on the way and we did not have
the time needed to return to the shop, or there was so much work on the
ship that it was not practical to bring in each pipe. In these cases we
would bring enough new pipe, a portable welding machine, oxygen and
acetylene bottles for burning, chain falls and come-alongs, and everything
else we needed to do the work out on the ship itself.</p>
<p>The hours we would work would vary a great deal. Basically, we would
work until the job was done or we were relieved by the next shift. Our
hours would begin at the shape-up at the shop and would end when we
returned to the shop. Sometimes this meant just a few hours; other times
it meant working very long hours. If the job was up in Baton Rouge or way
down river, the shifts would overlap because it might take a few hours for
the next shift to relieve us. Then we had to travel back to the shop.
Twelve-hour shifts were very common because there were only two shifts.
When we had to travel far from the shop it was easy to rack up 14, 15, or
16 hours. Sometimes we had to ride the ship up or down the river, mostly
on Exxon tankers, until we got the job done; then we had to wait for the
ship to reach a place where a launch could pick us up. The most hours I
ever worked was 23 hours. This happened when we caught a launch out of
Belle Chasse to an Exxon tanker and were not done before we passed the
last launch on the river (Pilot Town). We had to get off the ship when a
boat came from an offshore oilrig. We then took a helicopter from the rig
to Venice where the company picked us up.</p>
<p>In my opinion the worst place to be sent to was the coal terminal in
Port Sulphur. Coal ships, for the most part, have the deepest holes of any
ship. Then you add to that the weight of the coal, the dock has to be
extended out into the river because the ship's draft would exceed the
water's depth. This meant we had to climb up the ladder to the catwalk
along side of the conveyer that loaded coal on the ship, and then back
down another ladder to the other side of the dock. This was a real pain in
the ass when you consider we had to carry our tools, material and pipe
with us. Often the work on coal ships was repairing steam pipes to the
fuel oil tanks. That required us to climb down a 100-foot ladder down into
the pipe tunnel.</p>
<p>Tankers were always fun because we could not do any hot work on them.
Even in breaking lose flanges we had to make sure that we created no
sparks. This meant we could not burn, chisel or use a nutbuster to get the
bolts off. Tankers are a very messy place to work, particularity if you
have to work in the pumproom or in the cargo holes. It does not matter how
much protective clothing you wear, that damned oil always seemed to make
its way to your skin.
Protective outerwear was miserable in the hot and humid Louisiana summer,
because protective clothing is designed to keep substances from
penetrating it (though it did not seem to keep all that much oil out).
This meant that your body heat stayed in your clothing and you would sweat
like you were in a sauna; your inner clothes would be soaking wet.</p>
<p>The worst job on a tanker was working on the heating pipes in the cargo
holes. First you had to put an air test on the pipes to find where the
leaks were. There was always six inches of oil or more at the bottom of
the hole and you had to slosh around in that oil inspecting every inch of
the pipes. Then, when the pipes were repaired, you had to retest the
system. If the system still would not hold the right PSI, you had to go
back down there and inspect the pipes again.</p>
<p>Grain ships are also dangerous because grain dust is extremely
explosive. You may recall reading in the newspaper from time to time about
some grain silo blowing up; now you know the reason behind the explosion.
But what I liked least about grain ships are the rats on many of them.
Marine rats tend to be large and sometimes aggressive.
Once, when we were replacing many steam pipes in the pipe tunnel I was
sitting at an opening that we had cut in the deck to get long sections of
pipe in. I was turning a pipe for the welder and a big old rat comes up to
the hole and just stood there looking at me. It did not take long to find
out that staring down the rat would not work, nor did yelling at it have
any effect. I grabbed a pipe wench and threw it at the rat, which then ran
off. Needless to say that made me a bit nervous and I kept an eye out for
that badass rat with its nice shiny teeth.</p>
<p>Dixie leased a small dock from the Port of New Orleans for jobs that
would take longer than a ship could stay at the other docks. They could
get two general cargo ships tired up along the dock or one tanker or grain
ship. Most of the work down there was on Lykes Brothers' ships, which
Dixie had a contact with.</p>
<p>Periodically each Lykes' general cargo ship had to go through a general
shutdown for inspection and repairs that they had held off on.</p>
<p>Among the many things we had to do was open up all the overboard
clapper valves (this is a stop check valve to control the direction of
flow) to make sure they were not stuck open or closed. Most of these were
located in the cargo holes; one was located in the forepeak tank. Along
with opening up the one clapper valve there were two gate valves in the
forepeak that had to be removed every time. These valves were part of the
ballast system and were located lower down in the tank. The first one was
not so bad, but the second one was difficult to get to. In the middle of
the forepeak is the bulkhead for the chain locker. To get to the second
valve you had to climb to the bottom of the tank, go passed the chain
locker and then up two levels to the valve. When a tank is opened up a
marine chemist must check the atmosphere for toxic or explosive flumes and
for oxygen deficiency. They would stay at the top of the tank and lower
down their sniffer to the bottom and if the atmosphere was safe they would
certify the tank as "safe for workers" and whether or not it was "safe for
hot work". In the old days they use to put a canary in a cage and lower it
to the bottom of the tank. If the bird was still alive when they pulled it
out then they would let workers into the tank. The problem with the
forepeak tank was that, with the chain locker in the middle of it, testing
the atmosphere straight down from the hole would not give you a reading of
the atmosphere on the other side of the chain locker.</p>
<p>Once when I had to go down into the forepeak tank to get the second
valve out, I hit a pocket of dead air on the other side of the chain
locker. I could feel myself getting dizzy and I had started to climb back
down when I passed out. After I hit the bottom the other pipefitter pulled
me over directly under the hole, where they lifted me out with a cherry
picker onto the dock. I regained consciousness out on the deck of the
ship. Had that been more than just a pocket of dead air I could have
died.</p>
<p>Often when the ship was in for its inspection we would have to go down
into the pipe tunnel and inspect steam pipes, replacing sections that
leaked. It is very tight at the point where you go into the pipe tunnel
from the engine room - you cannot sit up and it is hard to turn around.
Some tunnels are so tight that the only way to get through them is to lie
down on the bean and pull yourself through the tunnel sideways, for there
is not even enough room to lie flat. In tunnels where there was more room
we would ride the bean down on something that looked like a
skateboard.</p>
<p>When Dixie could not get enough workers from the shape up they would
call the union hall and however many workers were needed would be
dispatched. The hall workers were mostly land workers who many of them had
never been on a ship before. On one occasion I had cutout all the bad pipe
from the pipe tunnel, and had fitted up the new pipe and was ready for a
welder. The welder that I had been given was a hall welder who had never
been in a ship's pipe tunnel before. (I might add that a pipe tunnel is
not a place for someone who is claustrophobic.) The welder had to go down
into the tunnel first so he was crawling in front of me. Being a bit of a
joker at times, and knowing that he had never been down in a tunnel
before, I was telling him about all the critters we supposedly had found
down there. First I talked about rats, and then I brought up snakes and so
on. When I am joking around like this I start off with what may be
possible and then gradually get so ridiculous that the person should know
that I am feeding them a line of bull. Being a person who loves dramatics,
I then grabbed his leg and yelled, "Something has got you!" Well, I did
not know that I had been getting to him. He shot ahead like a rocket,
turned around (I don't see how he did it), passed me by and flew out of
that tunnel like his ass was on fire. He passed by the toolpusher saying
he quit and we never saw him again. Oops, I guess I got a little carried
away there.</p>
<p>I came out of the tunnel to find out if he was ok and to let him know
that I was just bull-shitting him. The toolpusher came up to me and asked
me what had happened, so I told him the story. As he was laughing he
commented that I should take it easier on the next welder or we might not
get the job done.
High on the list of undesirable jobs in ship repair is working on steam
pipes on top of the boilers. Most of the time we would work up there while
the boiler was still lit. More often than not, a steam joint had blown out
and we had to go up there to replace the gasket.</p>
<p>Steam lines are one-way systems with globe valves (globe valves are
one-way valves). We would close the valve upflow from the blown joint. If
the blown joint is on the downflow side of a valve, we would close that
valve. Then we would bleed off the pressure on the downflow side of the
value. This meant that we might be replacing a gasket on one side of a
valve, while the other side of the valve would be fully pressurize with
steam. Depending on which steam system it was and the boiler itself, the
system could be pressurize at between 1,500 to 2,500 PSI. As you could
image it was extremely hot up there. On one side of the flange we would
have to take out all the bolts for the flexitalic gasket to come out; on
the other side we just had to loosen the bolts. Once the gasket was out we
would slide in the new gasket then hammer the flange tight. Not all valves
would hold completely which meant that we had to keep our body parts away
from the joint.</p>
<p>Because of the heat we could only work for about five minutes at a
time, so we did the work in shifts. One time the "stupidintendent" came
over to the boiler and was watching us work. He asked us why both
pipefitters were not up there? We told him that we were working in shifts
because of the heat. Well this fool must of had some inner desire to prove
why we called him a "stupidintendent", because he climbed up there to show
us how a real man could do the job. After about 7 or 8 minutes up there he
quickly climbed down and ran over to the bilge and puked his guts out,
then disappeared without saying a word; proving the point that common
sense ain't all that common.
Dixie was an interesting place to work because you never knew where you
would end up each shift. I must admit that after finishing a job on a ship
under way, spending the rest of our time out on the fantail watching the
country side go by was something that I enjoyed.</p>
<p>Dixie was also an interesting place to work because of the people that
worked there. They all were real characters. Within our basic crew there
were people from many different backgrounds. The foreman of the pipe
department was Greek, and was really a nice guy; I never heard him yell at
anyone. The night shift foreman was a young guy from Cincinnati who was
taking a few College classes during the day. He got the foreman job for
two reasons, first he was good with paper work (on this type of job most
of the foreman's job was paper work) and because he showed up all the
time. unlike the rest of us who would layup from time to time.</p>
<p>The toolpusher for the shop had lived all his life in New Orleans. In
small companies like Dixie the toolpushers also worked. I like this guy a
lot and he was a good example of what a toolpusher should be. Anytime you
had a question about how to do something, he was always willing to teach
you.</p>
<p>Among the working crew, who was to be the toolpushers depended on the
job itself, where it was located, how many different jobs we were working
and who showed up. Most everyone in our crew played the role of toolpusher
at some time or another. Out at the repair dock an interesting fellow
named Dead Eye was the toolpusher most of the time (that is when he showed
up). He also had lived all his life in New Orleans, and was a good example
of the fact that not all people with long hair were hippies. He had spent
a number of years in Angloa State Prison for killing some guy in a bar
fight. Dead Eye's younger brother was also a part of the crew.</p>
<p>There was one Black pipefitter, also of New Orleans' origin. It seemed
no matter what the situation was or how long we had worked he was always
smiling and joking around, but one should not be fooled by his easy going
nature, because he was one of the hardest workers on the crew. He also did
time in Angloa.</p>
<p>Then there was Ray who was a hillbilly from West Virginia who always
had a good story to tell. Then there was an old drunk from Texas who would
only work on those days that he was sober. There were two brothers who
would work from time to time who were New Orleans' French (New Orleans'
French are not the same as Cajuns); one of which had also done time in
Angloa for manslaughter. The other members of the New Orleans' radical
community worked with the machinists, so I did not directly work with any
of them.</p>
<p>Also on the crew was a Cajun by the name of Joe. He was both a
pipefitter and a welder, and on most jobs that he worked, he was the
toolpusher. Old Joe would not work jobs that he knew would include
overtime hours. I never heard him raise his voice to another person, but
he had one hell of a temper and beat the shit out of tools and pipe. That
man could run off a line of cuss words faster and longer than anyone could
image. The interesting thing was that he was once a schoolteacher. In
listening to him talk about Cajuns, I became fascinated by their culture
and history.
Cajuns were run out of Acadia (what is now Nova Scotia) by the English.
Some of them, the English sold into slavery in Virginia, others scattered,
and many came down to Louisiana. They did not settle in New Orleans for
two reasons; they were poor farmers and fishermen and liked to live in the
country. and also, the New Orleans French of that period did not much like
them. The area that they first settled was north and west of New Orleans.
Later plantation owners who wanted to expand their holdings forced them
off their land north of New Orleans. The plantation owners viewed the
Cajuns as inferiors and did not like the fact that most of them were
opposed to slavery. The Cajuns were victimized by nightriders (vigilantes)
and later by the KKK, their homes were burned down and many of them were
lynched. This forced them further into the swamps and bayous of southern
Louisiana.</p>
<p>The social and cultural make up of Cajuns is very similar to the Dineh
(Navajos) of the southwest. They both live in expended family groups call
clans, which are basically matriarchal. They both have a high respect for
nature and they both base much of the healing practices on the local herbs
they would gather. They are both oral people whose history, culture and
stories are passed down by the Elders.</p>
<p>The last member of the regular crew was an old time seaman named
Whitie. When he got too old to go to sea anymore he started working at
Dixie. He was a radical working stiff, and though he never joined the IWW
he was very sympathetic to Wobblies. He knew many stories about Blackie
Vaughan, and you could tell Blackie was somewhat of a hero to him. I spent
many hours out on the fantail of some ship riding the river and listening
to his stories. People like Whitie, in my view, are living treasures of
the working class because they can tell stories of the working class that
you will never find in any books. I really wish I had taken the time back
then to write down some of Whitie's stories. The same goes for many of the
other Elders of the labor movement, who I sought out and listen to and
learned from. Unfortunately, the radicals that came out of the "New Left"
did not care much for the Elders of the struggle, and far too few young
people ever heard their stories and most of them are lost as they died
off.
In the cargo holes of general cargo ships you will find graffiti from all
over the world. Most of it was like graffiti you find any place, someone's
name and where they are from. Occasionally you would find some radical
message. That gave me the idea of putting up my own radical messages. I
did not want to use my own name, thus Louisiana Jack was born. I used
Louisiana because that would tell the origin of the message, and Jack
because it just seem to sound right with Louisiana. So Jack's Wobbly
messages were seen around the world.</p>
<p>Later I expanded Jack's role to one-page fliers on different working
class issues that were all signed by Louisiana Jack. Among old Wobbly
pamphlets there were many that were written as dialog between a Wobbly and
some worker. They would talk about some important issue, and it seemed to
me that this was a good method of conveying ideas so some of these fliers
would do the same. Louisiana Jack would discuss issues with some worker;
this made Louisiana Jack both a pen name and a fictitious character. I
would place these fliers in different locations on ships from around the
world, and I would poster them on the waterfront.</p>
<p>After I started a publication called Bayou La Rose, all the articles
that I wrote about the maritime industry I would sign Louisiana Jack. The
parts of Yardbird Blues that were previously published in Bayou La Rose
were also signed by Jack. Later Louisiana Jack became a fictitious
character again in stories about the "Low Dive Cafe" along with Northend
Dill and Steele Street Moll. Years later some of these stories were put
together as a pamphlet called "Down At The Low Dive Cafe". I realize that
I may have broken some literary rules and created some confusion with
Louisiana Jack, for it must be written somewhere that one should not use a
pen name that is also a fictitious character in their writings, but what
the hell, I play by my own rules. If someone does not like it then they
can inform on me to the academic police.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
