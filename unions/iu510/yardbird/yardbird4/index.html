<p class="redbar"></p>
<p>There are many different types of ships, and the differences are mostly
based upon the type of cargo the ship transports. Most all ships have some
basic things in common. Generally the deck from which the gangway comes
off is the maindeck. The forward most compartment below the maindeck is
the forepeak tank used for ballast. Also forward will be found the chain
locker for the anchor chain which protrudes down into the forepeak tank.
If you spot the main stack and go directly down below the maindeck you
will find the engineroom. Going aft from the engineroom at the center of
the ship, if it only has one engine, or on both sides if it has two
engines, will be the shaft alley. On both sides of the shaft alley you
will generally find tanks. What type of tanks those are will depend on the
ship. They could be fuel oil, lube oil, fresh water and so on.</p>
<p>On most all general cargo ships, and on any number of other ships,
going forward from the engineroom to the end of number two hold will be a
pipe tunnel. In the pipe tunnel you will find steam pipes going to fuel
oil tanks. Most ships use bunker oil for fuel. Bunker oil is almost as
thick as tar and needs steam to heat it in order for it to be able to be
pumped. Some will burn the fuel directly in the engines, while others will
burn it in large boilers, and the steam created runs the engines, these
are called steamships.</p>
<p>Upon the stern of the ship you will find written the ship's homeport,
and the flag of the country in which the ship is registered. Upon the
stack you will find, in most cases, a design that identifies the shipping
line that owns the ship, If you see a red flag flying off the mast that
means that the ship is taking on fuel.
The following is a rundown of the major types of commercial ships:</p>
<br /><p><b>1). General cargo ships (sometimes called Breakbulk
Carriers).</b></p>
<p>These ships will mostly have four or five holds (a hold is the cargo
space in a ship), with one or, in a few cases, two holds aft of the
engineroom, and four to five holds generally forward of the engineroom.
They have long protruding rigging for winches by each hold. These winches
are used to load and unload the cargo. The cargo is usually packaged and
moved as single parcels, or assembled together on pallet boards.
Longshoremen go down into the holds to hook up the cargo to be lifted out.
Some general cargo ships may also have refrigerated spaces for perishable
cargo. The average general cargo ship is about 500 feet long.</p>
<br /><p><b>2). Bulk carriers.</b></p>
<p>Like general cargo ships bulk carriers will have large hydraulic
hatches covering the holds, but will not have any overhead rigging. Bulk
carriers are used for things such as grain, ore, wood chips, etc, that can
be poured down into a hold. They will load and off-load at special port
terminals for whatever cargo they may carry. Sometimes the holds must be
steamed cleaned by laborers when the ship is set to carry a different
cargo than the one that it unloaded. The average bulk carrier ship is
around 800 feet long.</p>
<br /><p><b>3). Container ships.</b></p>
<p>These ships are designed to carry large steel containers that are
usually 20 feet or 40 feet long, eight feet wide and eight feet tall.
These ships are loaded and off loaded by large cranes to and from trucks.
There are some that are also designed where the bow opens up and barges
are pulled in that have containers on them. Container ships are limited to
ports that have container terminals.</p>
<p>The advantage of using containers is that all the cargo in each
container will be destine for some location away from the port taken there
by either truck or rail. This does away with the warehouses that are
needed for general cargo ships where the cargo is divided up and loaded
into truck trailers or railcars. Container ships come in many different
sizes; some now are incredibly huge.</p>
<br /><p><b>4). Auto carriers.</b></p>
<p>These are huge ships that are nothing more than floating parking
garages. They can hold between 2,000 and 4,000 vehicles. Ramps are lowered
out of the side of the ship and the vehicles are driven off. The average
auto carrier is about 600 feet long, 100 feet wide, and over 100 feet
tall.</p>
<br /><p><b>5). Tankers.</b></p>
<p>These are little more than oil drums with an engine. Though the most
common tanker hauls oil, there are other tankers that haul many different
types of liquids and gases. You can spot a tanker by the large amount of
piping forward of the bridge on the main deck. The piping is for loading
and off loading the cargo. There will be no large hatch covers like there
is on general cargo ships and bulk carries, but there will be much smaller
manholes at each tank for workers who need to climb down into the holds to
work.</p>
<p>Just forward of the bridge is the pumproom, where the pumps for the
ballast system will be found. Tankers come in all sizes, with the largest
ones being supertankers that are nearly a quarter of a mile long and wider
than a football field. There are few ports that supertankers can enter and
thus they are mostly loaded and off-loaded from pumping stations off
shore.</p>
<br /><p><b>6). Fishing vessels.</b></p>
<p>Most people think of fishing vessels as being just boats, but in
today's industrial world many of these vessels are as large as some ships
and, in some cases, they are converted general cargo ships. The following
are different types of fishing vessels:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Fishing boats - These may be as long as 90 feet and will have
refrigerated holds.</li>
<li>B. Processors - These ships not only catch fish, but also within them
there is a factory to completely process the fish. The factory deck will
be right under the main deck and the fish come in and they are cleaned,
filleted and packaged.</li>
<li>C. Non-fishing processors - These are a rather new type of ship that a
few multinational corporations use. All that I have seen have been
converted general cargo ships that have huge factory decks	and
refrigerated holds.</li>
</ul>
<br /><p><b>7). Oil industry vessels.</b></p>
<p>These are the vessels that are used by the oil industry in offshore
drilling. These include work and living barges, supply boats, and pipeline
vessels. The pipeline vessels will have huge rolls of pipe that they roll
out into the water to connect the offshore oil well with an onshore
facility.</p>
<br /><p><b>8.) Passenger ships.</b></p>
<p>Today passenger ships are mostly used as cruise ships, but there are
still a few passenger ships that transport people from port to port for
the purpose of transportation, rather than sightseeing. I have worked on
only one such ship that took people from New Orleans to the Panama
Canal.</p>
<p>Some cargo ships will also include rooms for passengers, because if a
ship has passengers, in many ports, it is allowed to dock before other
ships. I have known a few people who have used this as a cheap means to
travel to different parts of the world.</p>
<br /><p><b>9). Ferryboats.</b></p>
<p>These are still in use in places where bridges cannot be built or are
not constructed, for one reason or another. Some cross short bodies of
water, while some sail long distances, like the Alaskan ferry. Ferries
come in all sizes; from small passenger only ferries to the huge ferries
the size of container ships that are used in northern Europe.</p>
<br /><p><b>10). Tow and tug boats.</b></p>
<p>These are small vessels that generally have two powerful engines.
Towboats are used for moving barges while tugboats are used to move ships,
in most cases to dock them.</p>
<br /><p><b>11). Barges.</b></p>
<p>These are unpowered vessels that require a towboat to move. Barges are
used to transport different cargoes of which there are three basic types:
there is the sunken hold type for such things as grain and ore, the flat
top type for such things as containers and the tanker barges for liquids
and gases. There are also barges for many other purposes; living barges,
work barges, crane barges to name a few.</p>
<br /><p><b>12). Specialized ships.</b></p>
<p>There are many ships that are constructed or converted for specialized
purposes, like dredging, exploration, offshore construction, work gang
ships (these are for housing workers in areas where there is no onshore
living quarters), or for specialized cargo. For example, banana boats that
are not much more than small general cargo ships. Banana boats are nasty
damn ships, for down in their holds one may come across very large
spiders.</p>
<p>As a pipefitter, there are few, if any, compartments, tanks, voids,
tunnels and holds that we do not, at some time, have to work in. Along
with shipfitters, marine pipefitters will have more direct experience in
all the parts of a ship than even the seamen who sail the ship.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
