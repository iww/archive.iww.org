<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/250x250xSCU.jpg.pagespeed.ic.sV1OVpEWf4/" width="300" height="300" align="right" alt="" />This past Friday, September 25, the National Labor Relations Board issued a new ruling regarding the struggle between the IWW Sisters&rsquo; Camelot Canvass Union and their former bosses at Sisters&rsquo; Camelot.</p>
<p>This new ruling reverses the 2013 ruling by an administrative law judge which stated the workers at Sisters&rsquo; Camelot were not protected under the National labor Relations Act because they were independent contractors. With this decision being reversed, Sisters&rsquo; Camelot is ruled to have violated labor law when they fired Canvass Union member shugE Mississippi while on strike in 2013 as part of their union-busting campaign.</p>
<p>This new ruling also uses the same argument to clarify that Sisters&rsquo; Camelot violated labor law when they refused to negotiate with their worker&rsquo;s union, and again when they offered concessions to workers if they were to abandon bargaining collectively as a union.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p><b><strong>By Dorsett IWW</strong></b><b> - <a href="https://dorsetiww.wordpress.com/2015/09/17/there-will-be-no-unpaid-workers-at-the-co-op/" target="_blank">Dorsett IWW</a>, September 17, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img width="400" height="250" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/coop1.jpg" alt="" />Dorset IWW General Members&rsquo; Branch is pleased to announce that our dispute with a Bournemouth outlet of the Co-operative has been settled amicably. We have a verbal assurance from local management who are USDAW members, that they have no wish to exploit unpaid workers on their premises, and that their connection with &lsquo;Prospects&rsquo; has been severed. We congratulate them on their principled decision and affirm our commitment to defeat the government&rsquo;s work programme and end unpaid labour. </p>
<p>Nationally however, the situation is less clear; we have had sight of a Co-op internal document that sets out the parameters of their unpaid work experience programme. Whilst it insists that placements must be voluntary and offer meaningful experience, we note that vulnerable adults are being conscripted who may not be fully aware of their rights. It&rsquo;s highly likely some of them will not be able to make an informed decision and/or will get browbeaten by jobcentre staff with targets to meet. Once they are on the scheme if they leave they may be deemed to have made themselves intentionally unemployed, and be sanctioned. Lastly of course, however you dress it up, it&rsquo;s unpaid labour. How long does it take to assess a person&rsquo;s suitability for working in a grocer&rsquo;s shop? A week, two? Why then should a national chain not speculate a fortnight&rsquo;s minimum wage to find out?</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 09/20/2015 - 3:18pm</p>
<p><b><strong>By Andrew Stewart</strong></b><b> - <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/18/friedrichs-v-cta-the-supreme-court-case-that-could-destroy-labor-unions-as-we-know-them/" target="_blank"><em>CounterPunch</em></a>, September 18, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/180x187xEWIU620.jpg.pagespeed.ic.fpDvhmbgjh/" alt="" />This Presidential campaign has become even more of a media spectacle than the last two were, which in and of itself proves our electoral system is broken because the voters treat governance like professional wrestling. The Republican field is so close to a Vince McMahon Slam-O-Rama match that we do not even need to come up with silly stage names for these doofuses.</p>
<p>But what stuns me most about the Democratic field is that, even in the midst of our kinda-sorta dialogue about democratic socialism brought about by the Sanders dog-and-pony show, not a single candidate has yet to talk about the cornerstone of a socialist society, our barely-breathing labor unions. We have heard news stories about everyone&rsquo;s favorite walrus, AFL-CIO President <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/afl-cio-endorsement-2016-democratic-primary-119701" target="_blank">Richard Trumka</a>, coming down from on high and reminding the masses that he, not they, get to choose whether the unions endorse Sanders or Clinton. But the elephant in the room which no one is talking about is the <em><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/friedrichs-v-california-teachers-association/" target="_blank">Friedrichs v. CTA</a>&nbsp;</em>Supreme Court case, which has seen the Petitioner Brief filed on September 4, 2015, followed by nineteen amicus curiae briefs on September 10 and. For those just tuning in, this is the case that will destroy labor unions as we know them in our country. This omission from our national dialogue is analogous to the three months before 9-11 when everyone was telling President Bush that something was going to happen but he was too busy farting around on his ranch to care.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 09/20/2015 - 3:09pm</p>
<p><b><strong>By Kasparkonsequent</strong></b><b> - <a href="https://wearetherabl.wordpress.com/2015/09/18/porn-sex-positivity-and-working-class-solidarity/" target="_blank"><em>Red and Black Leeds</em></a>, September 18, 2015<br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/212x322xwomenwobglobe.jpg.pagespeed.ic.1NtqxA-n45/" alt="" />The UK&rsquo;s gradually expanding porn law restrictions have been going on for years and eventually came to a climax the end of 2014, when previously existing <a target="_blank" href="http://mylesjackman.com.php/my-blog/106-the-following-content-is-not-acceptable">restrictions</a> were applied to all pornographic material made in the UK. Though I still see the occasional protest against this, and a few campaigners are still trying to overturn it, the flurry of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/12/face-sitting-protest-outside-parliament-against-new-porn-rules">outrage</a> has largely died down. My aim here is not to defend the ban, but to critique the way this has been discussed, so we might be able to distinguish in future between what some members of the public want the sex industry to be, and an expression of working class solidarity towards those of us who work in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious to most people that the list of banned acts represents pure moralising, and that the people who made this list seem to have a particular idea of what normal sex is and should be (part of which, as a number of people have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/02/uk-porn-law-sexist-female-ejaculation-ban_n_6254678.html">noted</a>, seems to be based on the idea that sex is something that women do for men). The legislation is clearly not about what should or shouldn&rsquo;t happen on a porn set, but is entirely about what should be depicted and how. This is no mistake, the changes are part of the Obscene Publications Act, designed to outlaw any material that &ldquo;tends to deprave and corrupt&rdquo;. The fact that some of the banned acts are also things that many workers will want to avoid at work is coincidental and not the purpose of the ban. This becomes apparent when we see that vomiting, for example from facefucking, is something that is acceptable &ldquo;if it is not performed as part of the sexual act, and is not visibly enjoyed by the participants&rdquo;. The important phrase is &ldquo;visibly enjoyed&rdquo;, as the issue is not whether or not the worker is actually enjoying having the back of their throat hit until they vomit, but whether or not they have the inclination or acting ability to portray someone who does enjoy it. And according to the OPA they should not appear to enjoy it as it might give people watching the idea that this could be fun. However if your work involves occasional uncontrolled vomiting and you look suitably unimpressed by it when it happens, then as far as this legislation is concerned that&rsquo;s fine and nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Whether consciously or not, a lot of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/11270359/Porn-laws-Banning-spanking-is-bonkers-and-downright-frightening.html">responses</a> to this have mirrored the same attitude in the sense that they&rsquo;ve not been about what the work is like for those people having sex on camera, but about what consumers think should or shouldn&rsquo;t be depicted, and how it should be represented, and what porn should look like to portray sex in a certain way to society. Progressives all over the UK have complained that they want female pleasure to be depicted and so are against the ban on female ejaculation, that they want women to be shown as empowered in sex and so are against the ban on face-sitting, that they want a variety of sexual acts to be represented so we aren&rsquo;t conditioned to masturbate only to the same tired misogynistic porn formula. This is fair enough. It&rsquo;s not only films and high art that influence our society and how we think, but all the media we consume. Even if all the porn actors on set were to be bored out of their minds, hate each other, and feel disgusted by the thought of having to get it on for the camera, if they produce a work of fiction that depicts the healthy negotiating of consent, where the people having sex are smiling at each other while on camera, where women are portrayed as having their own sexual desires, that could have a positive affect on people watching it.</p>
