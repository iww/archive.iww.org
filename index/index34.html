<a href="../content/i-am-tired-healthcare/" rel="bookmark">I Am Tired of Healthcare</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 08/09/2015 - 3:51pm</p>
<p><strong>By Luz Sierra - <a href="https://iwwmiami.wordpress.com/2015/08/05/i-am-tired-of-healthcare/" target="_blank">Miami IWW</a>, August 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/injuries.jpg" alt="" />Five years had passed since I first began working as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). A CNA is a health care provider that assists Registered Nurses (RN&rsquo;s). They are the ones considered to do the &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; in healthcare: changing, bathing, feeding, and providing any form of assistance to patients that RN&rsquo;s do not have the time or opportunity to provide in today&rsquo;s fast-paced and multi-tasking health care environment. Through providing care to patients, I have seen many of the atrocities of today&rsquo;s society, especially with mental health.</p>
<p>The past year I was offered a patient companion (sitter) position at a local hospital after being laid off at my previous workplace for organizing. It is a pretty chill job. Depending on the census, I either provide one-to-one care or one-to-two patients care who are at risk to fall and are under Baker Act (a Florida mental health law that forces a patient to remain in the facility and to be under supervision up to 72 hours because of potential harm to self or others), or high risk patients likely to be injured. Throughout the majority of my employment there, I have mostly seen patients with mental health disorders. Among them are the elderly that are diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. In my experience, they are not given enough or any treatment at all. They are only given medication that sedates them for hours or they are simply ignored by RN&rsquo;s. An individual with such an ailment could become very anxious, agitated, and disorientated which leads to many problems. For instance, they often attempt to get out of bed unsafely due to memory loss, they can remove their intravenous therapy (IV) if they are bothered by it, and they will sometimes attempt to physically hurt people they do not recognize as they become anxious and fearful of everyone. The list can go on. Mental health disorders are not easily treated, so there are moments when you will need help from CNA&rsquo;s, RN&rsquo;s, or even administration. Unfortunately such help is non-existent at times, like one day at work when I was assigned a patient that had Alzheimer&rsquo;s and was extremely confused.</p>
<p>On that day I received the patient in a difficult situation. The first moment I arrived to her room, she was already punching and kicking the CNA who was trying to prevent her from getting out of bed. The CNA warned me to be careful since she was very combatant; she wasn&rsquo;t lying. I spent the first two hours preventing her from getting out of bed while she attempted to repeatedly punch and kick me. Eventually a physical therapist stopped by and walked her to the bathroom and around the room. Afterwards, the nurse provided her medication that calmed and reoriented her. After taking her medication, the patient began to talk to me kindly, telling me about her life until she fell asleep for about thirty minutes. When she woke up, the medication was no longer effective so she was agitated and confused again. She wanted to leave her room, but wasn&rsquo;t allowed to, so she was pushing and hitting me, and screaming loudly for help. I wanted to back away from her since that&rsquo;s what you are taught when dealing with an aggravated patient, but I couldn&rsquo;t as she was trying to get up and placing herself at risk of falling. I called the nurse to tell her what was happening, but all she did was stop by and talk to the patient. When she left, the patient became aggressive again.</p>
<p>During the next three hours I called the nurse five times, but she didn&rsquo;t do anything other than try to calm the patient through talking to her. There&rsquo;s no problem with that but if the patient is hurting herself and trying to attack caregivers there should be a better alternative. I am not a big advocate of medication, but in my opinion, it&rsquo;s better to sedate a patient in order to prevent any further harm if the RN is not going to be there 24/7 and if a patient companion has limited options to prevent a patient from hurting anyone or herself. &nbsp;Luckily, another nurse stopped by and took the patient to visit her husband who was also hospitalized. I was ordered to stay with her as she visited her husband. She was calm for a while, but then became agitated and wanted to leave the room in order to search for her children who weren&rsquo;t there. I had to take her back to her room where she didn&rsquo;t want to stay, and spent another three hours walking back and forth from her room to her husband&rsquo;s room. Along the way she would hit and scream at me while the nursing staff were all watching and did nothing.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_930 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/miami-iww/" rel="tag" title="Miami IWW">Miami IWW</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_33 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/health-service-wor/" rel="tag" title="All workers employed in hospitals and health restoration services.">Health Service Workers Industrial Union 610</a></li></ul> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../content/i-am-tired-healthcare/" title="Read the rest of I Am Tired of Healthcare.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><strong>By members of the Merseyside IWW &ndash; <a target="_blank" href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/08/05/your-class-needs-you/">Liverpool IWW</a>, August 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p>About twenty people met in Liverpool Central Library&rsquo;s meeting room 2 last night, as part of IWW national secretary Dave Pike&rsquo;s speaking tour of England, Scotland and Wales. Dave&rsquo;s presentation &ndash; called &lsquo;Your Class Needs You&rsquo; &ndash; attracted a mixture of members, prospective new wobblies (or &lsquo;probblies&rsquo; in IWW lingo) and people who were just curious what the IWW they knew from tales of Joe Hill were up to nearly a century after his murder.</p>
<p>It was a lot less eventful than the last time Liverpool IWW met on William Brown Street. In 1921, scouse wobblies led by the writer George Garrett occupied the front of the Walker Art Gallery, and were met with a <a target="_blank" href="https://libcom.org/history/garrett-george-1896-1996">full scale police riot</a>.</p>
<p>For all us IWW members love the old stories, this was evening very much focused on the IWW of today, and how a new generation of relatively young, casualised workers are leading the way with some inspirational campaigns and struggles. We watched videos of workers from Starbucks, Jimmy Johns and London language schools fighting for improvements to their working lives.</p>
<p>The modern day Liverpool IWW are planning some big things over the next few months, and are thrilled to have settled into our new home of Liverpool Central Library.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/04/2015 - 8:07pm</p>
<p><strong>By Chelsea Harris - <a href="http://labornotes.org/blogs/2015/07/it-took-direct-action-make-boss-pay-seattles-new-minimum-wage" target="_blank"><em>Labor Notes</em></a>, July 23, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/bossgetsit.preview.gif" alt="" />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you people are!&rdquo; barked Joe Walker, the owner of Pandora&rsquo;s Adult Cabaret, a Seattle-area strip club, to the workers gathered in his office. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you all go flip burgers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But despite this confrontational language&mdash;typical of how he often spoke to employees&mdash;within hours Walker would give in to their demand for the back pay he owed them.</p>
<p>As a boss, Walker is abhorrent, showing no respect for or concern for the safety of his club&rsquo;s servers or dancers. Employees had horror stories of working around bodily fluids and other filth with no safety procedures, frequent illness with no health benefits or sick leave, and dancers being stalked and sexually assaulted at the club.</p>
<p>Add to this abusive language and shady bookkeeping. Managers had told bartenders and servers not to report tips. Instead, managers were reporting employee tips as $5 a week.</p>
<p>On April 1 the Seattle minimum wage went up to $11 per hour (the first step in <a href="http://labornotes.org/2014/06/seattle-15-minimum-signed-and-sealed-unpopular-loopholes">a process towards a $15 per hour minimum wage</a>, which won&rsquo;t go into effect for two to six years).</p>
<p>But two weeks later, Walker was still paying his servers the old minimum wage of $9.47. When Alyssa, a server at the club, asked when they could expect a wage increase, she was fired.</p>
<p>Lindsay, another server fed up with Walker&rsquo;s hostility whenever she asked about wages, put in her two weeks&rsquo; notice&mdash;but was promptly fired too. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beneath this job,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, Lindsay is in a union: the Seattle branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (the &ldquo;Wobblies&rdquo;), which anyone can join, except people with the power to hire and fire. After meeting with the union&rsquo;s Seattle general organizing committee, Lindsay and Alyssa began an escalation plan.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/04/2015 - 7:51pm</p>
<p><strong>FW Patrick, Press Secretary - <a href="http://kyiww.org/2015/08/04/ky-iww-now-accepting-dues-on-line/" target="_blank">Kentucky IWW</a>, August 4, 2015</strong></p>
<p>After much tinkering, the KY IWW GMB has developed a way to collect dues on-line. We feel this is an easy way for those members who are from far-off, or simply unable to attend certain meeting days, to remain part of the One Big Union.</p>
<p>You can follow the link through our &ldquo;Dues and Membership&rdquo; page to pay dues now or in the future. The link there will direct you to an external page where you can select your dues range and remain a member in good standing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also hopeful that we&rsquo;ll have more options through the page in the future, including ways to join the KY IWW on-line, donate to the branch, purchase branch stamps, and so on.</p>
<p>One (or two) final thing(s): notes from the July meeting&ndash;including a long think piece on movement music&ndash;are forthcoming. Stayed tuned for that. And finally, be sure to join us for the KY IWW GMB open house THIS SATURDAY,&nbsp;8:00 p.m., at our space in The Mammoth. Hope to see you all there!</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/04/2015 - 7:34pm</p>
<p><b>By The Houston IWW Solidarity Network - <a href="https://htowniwwsolnet.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/the-fight-against-felipe-serna-and-wage-theft-in-houston/" target="_blank">Houston IWW</a>, July 29, 2015</b></p>
<p>The Houston IWW is engaged in a fight with a local contractor, Felipe Serna, responsible for wage theft of three former employees: Hector, Pancho, and Mauricio.&nbsp; These three men were hired by Felipe Serna in May of 2015 for the remodeling of a house in Sweeny, Texas.&nbsp; They were offered $150/day each for their services and provided room and board at the house.&nbsp; Several days in Serna decides $150 is too much and instead wants to pay them $100/day instead.&nbsp; The men held their ground, stating $150 was the agreed upon wage, and Serna backed off.</p>
<p>While at work one day, Serna tells the men he is letting them go.&nbsp; The men ask for payment for the previous three days of labor and Serna refuses, accusing them of stealing equipment.&nbsp; To add insult to injury, Hector, Pancho, and Mauricio weren&rsquo;t driven back to Houston, but told to make their own way.&nbsp; It cost them $100 total for them to get transportation back to the city.</p>
<p>Serna and his actions are not an isolated event nor is he an employer that is merely a &ldquo;bad apple that spoils the bunch.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, Serna is representative of a social force that is exploiting immigrant labor in Houston and in this country.&nbsp; In fact, $750 million in wages are stolen each year in Houston alone!&nbsp; Despite a recent ordinance passed in Houston to curb wage theft, it hasn&rsquo;t stopped it nor could it.&nbsp; The reality is that Houston capitalists depend on wage theft to maintain existing profit rates and the social hierarchy.&nbsp; This exploitation is backed by a racist Sheriff&rsquo;s office run by Adrian Garcia that complies with 287g, Secure Communities, a program of collaboration between the police and ICE to deport and detain immigrants.</p>
<p>In the spirit of this perspective, on Friday, July 24th, the Houston IWW with Hector and Pancho marched to The Growing Tree Academy, a daycare facility in the Gulfton area of Houston to deliver demands to Serna, owned by his wife&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Because contractors often operate in the shadows, working from their homes and vehicles, they are difficult to track down.&nbsp; Hector read the demand letter in the presence of our union to the staff who kept interrupting him and declaring they have nothing to do with what happened.&nbsp; Serna wasn&rsquo;t there but showed up later when most of us had left to say he wanted to talk and he was instructed to follow up on the letter.</p>
<p><strong>We are demanding $1,450 in stolen wages including $100 for transportation.</strong></p>
<p>Hector, Pancho, and Mauricio aren&rsquo;t afraid of these employer thugs who prey on working class people.&nbsp; And neither is the IWW.&nbsp; Work itself is theft.&nbsp; But to steal the little subsistence we are given to reproduce ourselves and our families is despicable.&nbsp; The only way to deal with bosses like Serna is to organize together and fight together.</p>
