</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/18/2006 - 11:50am</p>
<img width="272" height="204" border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU630/Shattuck/shattuck%20rally%20sept%201.jpg" />PITTSBURGH, PA - The Starbucks Workers Union in about 50 cities around the world--including Pittsburgh--has called for a global day of action November 24th to protest Starbucks' anti-union activity and poor employee compensation.<br /> <br /> The Starbucks Union of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is calling for an end to corporate union-busting and demanding the reinstatement of five workers unlawfully fired by Starbucks for union activity.&nbsp; In March 2006, a National Labor Relations Board settlement was reached that reinstated two workers involved with the union movement and forced Starbucks to pay back wages and change discriminatory policies, including the workers' right to wear union buttons (which Starbucks had denied them).&nbsp; But the settlement seemed to do little to stop Starbucks? continued practice of intimidating workers involved in organizing.<br /> <br /> Over the last two years Starbucks has consistently responded to union activity with harassment, intimidation, and illegal firings.&nbsp; Since December 2005, five workers in NYC were unlawfully fired for engaging in protected union activity:<br /> <br /> <ul> <li>Joseph Agins fired from Starbucks, December 12th 2005</li> <li>Charles Fostrom fired from Starbucks, July 11th 2006</li> <li>Evan Winterscheidt fired from Starbucks, July 18th 2006</li> <li>Daniel Gross fired from Starbucks, August 5th 2006</li> <li>Isis Saenz fired from Starbucks, November 1st 2006</li> </ul> <p> The Starbucks Workers Union is demanding an immediate reinstatement of all NYC<br /> workers and an end to the corporate union-busting.<br /> <br /> The Union is also protesting the need for higher wages, appropriate staffing, guaranteed hours, and safer working conditions.&nbsp; &quot;Don't be fooled by Starbucks' so-called progressive, feel-good image,&quot; said Kevin Farkas, an IWW organizer in Pittsburgh. &quot;Starbucks is one of the most profitable and competitive global companies in history, with about $8 billion in net earnings in 2006.&nbsp; Yet Starbucks 'partners' have starting wages around $7/hr, far below a livable standard for any worker. Clearly, Starbucks chooses to make such huge profits off the backs of its under-compensated, part-time workforce. That's putting profits before people, something that most working folks find disgusting.&quot;<br /> <br /> Farkas went on to say that after six months on the job, typical raises amount to pennies, even as low as 11 cents in some documented cases.&nbsp; Despite Starbucks' claim of 'generous' healthcare, 401(k) retirement, and company stock options for employees, the reality is that wages and hours are so low that many employees can't afford such offerings after paying their rent, utility bills, car insurance and other basic bills each month.&nbsp; Starbucks also uses a part-time workforce; there are no full-time workers and no guaranteed hours per week, leaving many Starbucks 'partners' little choice but to partner up with a 2nd or 3rd job just to make ends meet.<br /> <br /> On November 24th, the Pittsburgh Starbucks Workers Union will be holding a protest against Starbucks' anti-union, anti-worker practices.&nbsp; An event is scheduled at the Starbucks Coffee store in Squirrel Hill.&nbsp; All friends of labor are invited to join the Union and demand justice for Starbucks workers in Pittsburgh and around the world.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_244 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/pittsburgh-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Pittsburgh General Membership Branch.

<img border="0" align="right" src="../graphics/agitators/classic/clocksm1.jpg" /><strong>As Christmas approaches, eleven workers at the Scottish Parliament face broken contracts and unemployment in the new year, courtesy of self-proclaimed champions of the Scottish working class, Tommy Sheridan and Rosemary Byrne.</strong> <p>They are both MSPs, Sheridan being the only candidate for the <em>Scottish Socialist Party</em> elected when the parliament was founded in 1999, and Byrne one of five more who joined him after the second election in 2003.</p> <p>Their party has been torn by a bitter dispute, centred around Sheridan's leadership, and a legal action he took against the <em>News of the World</em> when the paper made allegations about his private life. The rancour ended in Sheridan and Byrne's resignation from the SSP, and their founding of a new party called <em>Solidarity</em>.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_410 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/british-isles-regional-administration/" rel="tag" title="British Isles Regional Administration">British Isles Regional Administration</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_37 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/general-legal-publ/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from General, Legal, Public Interest, and Financial Office Workers Industrial Union 650.
