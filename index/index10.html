</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 09/04/2017 - 8:54pm</p>
<p><strong>By Staff - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/portland-fast-food-workers-burgerville-launch-strike-labor-day/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, September 4, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/3-4-1068x599.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" align="right" />Members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) launched a strike in Portland, Oregon at fast food chain Burgerville. The strike is the latest move by workers at the chain who have been organizing for months and demanding wage increases, an end to harassment for union activities, better schedules, and improvements of conditions. The group announced the strike on Labor Day with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/burgervilleworkersunion/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank">statement on their Facebook page:</a></p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The very first Labor Day was a massive strike and parade organized by thousands of workers in New York City in 1882. The chance for millions and millions of people to spend time with family and community this Monday was made possible by power wielded time and time again by striking workers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ironically, we workers at Burgerville don&rsquo;t get to enjoy this day dedicated to celebrating the power of workers. Working at Burgerville means we can&rsquo;t ta<span class="text_exposed_show">ke proper holidays, since doing so means taking a substantial pay cut or facing retaliation from management. Working at Burgerville means that we spend our holidays working for minimum wage just like any other day, fully aware of all the memories with friends and family we are missing out on. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">That&rsquo;s why we are going on strike today.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead of going to work for poverty wages while corporate bigshots take vacations, we are taking a stand. We are taking back Labor Day for our families, our friends, our coworkers, and ourselves. We are taking back Labor Day because we know that better pay, fair schedules, consistent hours, and healthier work environments have only ever been won by workers standing together and fighting for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are the heart of Burgerville and we deserve a change!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strike also takes place as fast food workers at McDonald&rsquo;s in the UK are also on strike. Burgerville workers union writes:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">McDonald&rsquo;s workers at two shops in England voted to go on a strike on September 4. These workers are organized through the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU), whose demands include wage increases and more consistent scheduling (Sound familiar?)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Immediately after the announcement of a strike, McDonald&rsquo;s stated that by the end of 2017 they will implement a guaranteed hours contract to every McDonald&rsquo;s worker in the UK. The BFAWU&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">plans to carry on with their strike to push for their other demands and to hold McDonald&rsquo;s to their word.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victory to the strikers!</p>

The band&rsquo;s logo, frequently called a &ldquo;hatchetman,&rdquo; has been deemed a gang symbol. This has resulted in harassment by local and federal police for having an ICP sticker or tattoo. Juggalos have been fired from employment, have been discriminated against in custody battles, have received longer and harsher sentences in court, and have been discharged from military service. The American Civil Liberties Union and ICP have been fighting this designation in court since 2014. So far, the courts have ruled that the FBI gang report should not be used as a reason to target Juggalos. However, this ruling is often ignored by law enforcement and it does nothing to hold the FBI accountable for the damage it has done.</p> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../node/9022/" title="Read the rest of GDC-IWOC Joint Statement on Repression of Juggalos.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:47pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Bay Area IWW - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-iww-recycling-workers-walk-off-job-over-unpaid-wages/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, August 24, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/12-1068x711.jpg" width="320" height="213" align="right" alt="" />Workers at Buyback, a recycling centre in Berkeley, have walked off the job this morning after the payment of their wages was delayed without explanation.</p>
<p>The workers, who are members of the Industrial Workers of the World, discovered at the start of their shift that none of them had received their scheduled payment for the previous fortnight&rsquo;s work, which was due to come through earlier this morning.</p>
<p>This the third occasion this year that wages have not been paid on time &ndash; something that can cause extensive problems for the finances of workers and their families. After turning up at 8 AM this morning and being offered no explanation from management for the error, Buyback workers held a union meeting and voted 18-0 to immediately walk out.</p>
<p>Buyback workers have already struck twice this year &ndash; the first an unannounced half-day walkout during the February 16 &lsquo;Day Without Immigrants,&rsquo; and the second a two-hour stoppage to hold a celebratory barbecue on May 1.</p>
<p>Workers have not yet returned to work and it&rsquo;s unclear at this stage whether the action will continue into tomorrow.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:35pm</p>
<p><strong>By Milwaukee IWW - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/building-mass-antifascism-milwaukee/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, August 21, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/1-46-1068x546.jpg" width="320" height="164" align="right" alt="" />On Saturday August 12th, white nationalists converged on the city of Charlottesville, Virginia to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee and the renaming of Lee Park to Emancipation Park. The fascists were outnumbered by antifascists and were driven from the park, but not without great cost, as we all know. On that day a fascist drove his car at high speed into the antifascist demonstration, injuring over 20 people and killing one, a 32 year old paralegal named Heather Heyer.</p>
<p>In Milwaukee we had been communicating with people in Charlottesville since Friday night. A friend said he worried someone from our side would be killed. To our horror this came to be true. The event gripped the country, and people were called to the streets to condemn the rising tide of fascism and racism, and in remembrance of the brave antifascist Heather Heyer.</p>
<p>As news of Heather&rsquo;s death spread on Saturday afternoon, we called for an emergency meeting that night in a park in the Riverwest neighborhood. Around 30 people came together to discuss how to respond to the attack in Charlottesville and move forward. The assembly agreed to call for a vigil the next day at 7:00 PM in the same park, rather than downtown.</p>
<p>Mass demonstrations against Trump and other targets are typically held in Milwaukee&rsquo;s downtown area in the evenings. We decided that since few people live downtown, and that the downtown area is not a working class neighborhood, we should instead hold the vigil where we stood, in the heart of Riverwest. There was some consideration of stepping outside of the comfort zone of a friendly neighborhood, but ultimately the group determined that for this demonstration, we should organize where we have a base. It was this decision which helped ensure a large turnout of working class people.</p>
<p>We went about doing the work to make the vigil happen. We gathered literature for tabling, collected our megaphones, banners, and flags. Artists provided sign making materials for people to make their own signs as the vigil was getting underway. We edited our General Defense Committee outreach flier to announce a follow up meeting, and quickly found space to host it. Organizers put together a speakers list and made sure to raise the voices of our comrades of color and women members. Members even put together a screen printing table in the park with a &ldquo;Good Night Far Right&rdquo; image. Allied organizations turned out their members and provided support. We made sure to have marshals wearing identifiable vests who knew how to handle themselves in the street. The marshals were tasked with managing traffic and ensuring the march proceeded slowly so everyone could stay together as a group. An experienced member crafted a media advisory and called all the major media outlets in town.</p>
<p>On Sunday night as 7:00 neared, people poured into the small park. Speakers opened with a moment of silence for Heather Heyer and emphasized the importance of the broader struggle. We spoke of the need to support the fights against deportations, the police, racism, and white supremacy, and the importance of organizing the working class. The crowd had swelled to around 400 people by the time the last speaker finished.</p>
<p>After the speeches, people then flooded into the streets to march through the neighborhood. Chants of &ldquo;No Nazis, No KKK, No Fascist USA&rdquo; reverberated off the polish flats and duplexes of Riverwest. We headed down a side street and people came out of their houses to join in and cheer us on. Families waved and cheered from their porches, joining us in the chants even if they didn&rsquo;t join the march. A sea of people waved red and black flags, IWW flags, and antifascist flags. The march was led by two black IWW banners, one reading &ldquo;Direct Action Gets the Goods&rdquo; and another for the General Defense Committee that reads &ldquo;Defend the Union, the Community, the Working Class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The march rounded the corner onto a major through street and paused in front of a popular local coffee shop to allow the march to tighten up, but it still filled an entire city block. The strength and power of our community was undeniable. The police looked on from a distance, a police liaison approached. They simply gave thumbs up and didn&rsquo;t even attempt to control the demonstration. We turned another corner and marched back up another side street chanting &ldquo;Say it Loud, Say it Clear, Refugees are Welcome Here.&rdquo; As we rounded the final block and poured back into the park our numbers had grown to over 500 people.</p>
<p>After the demonstration we stuck around to clean up the park and retired to our favorite bar to hang out, decompress, debrief and plan next steps. We also set about planning our next General Defense Committee meeting which was looking like it was going to be well attended. The next day we spoke with Wisconsin Public Radio about the mass demonstrations taking place all over the country and the rise of the alt right. We shared our vision of a mass anti-fascist and anti-racist working class movement with a statewide radio network that reaches millions of listeners.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the Wednesday GDC meeting we made sure to have a tight well-organized program and spent two hours making an agenda the night before. Wednesday rolled around and the librarians at the branch we decided to host our meeting at seemed a bit on edge. We reassured them that we are on the side of justice, and ultimately they were supportive. Nearly 100 people showed up to the meeting, most of them folks who were new to the IWW and GDC. It was a challenge to make sure each person&rsquo;s voice was heard, but everyone who wanted to speak had a chance. Here is a rough outline of the agenda.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:24pm</p>
<p><strong>By the IWW Greater Seattle General Defense Committee Local 24 - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/seattle-wa-august-13th-solidarity-hate-reportback/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, August 18, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/1-38-1068x625.jpg" width="320" height="187" align="right" alt="" />The IWW Greater Seattle General Defense Committee (GDC) put a wide-reaching public call-out to amass a significant contingent of individuals and organizations to confront yet another hateful &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo; rally by Joey Gibson and Patriot Prayer scheduled for August 13th. Sure enough, the rally was attended by white supremacist groups like Cascade Legion, the self-proclaimed &ldquo;Western-chauvinist&rdquo; Proud Boys, Anthony Parish the homophobic street preacher, and many other far-right bigots marching in the name of &ldquo;free speech&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This was the third time this year that Joey&rsquo;s crew descended upon our city to espouse their reactionary prejudices and ethno-nationalist, extreme-right fascist politics in our public space. This is the same crew that rallied with the likes of Jeremy Christian; he is the one who, this May, stabbed three people on a Portland MAX train (murdering two) for standing up against his Islamophobic tirade against two young women.</p>
<p>For this counter-protest, we intended to meet their rally in Westlake Park and confront them where they stood, stop their march, shame them, and disrupt their event. We assigned marshal roles to a small coalition of the GDC and other chosen leftist organizations in order to keep our march safe from outside threats and ensure smooth coordination throughout. Our marshals were specifically trained and practiced for this role.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know what our numbers would be, which made it difficult to prepare in advance. We set several tactical goals, planning for numbers as high as 200, but we made fallback plans for fewer. The terrorist attack in Charlottesville on Saturday changed everything, and overnight, the number of attendees for our Sunday march grew exponentially. We suddenly found ourselves side by side with hundreds of people who didn&rsquo;t necessarily share our objectives and who had a very different understanding of what confronting fascism means.</p>
<p>We marched, because that seemed like the right thing to do. As we got within a two block radius of Westlake Park, The Seattle Police Department, along with Bellevue PD, Tukwila PD, and Renton PD, flanked us and barred our path at every turn towards the direction of the rally. The bloc and other various brave attendees made a break down an alley to cut through, but were met by SPD at the other end &ndash; who relentlessly hosed the charge down with pepper spray and stole their banners. The SPD would later re-tweet photos of a seized banner and picket sign handles, calling them &ldquo;weapons&rdquo;. One was arrested.</p>
<p>Treated by medics and reconsolidated with the main contingent of the march, we continued together again. Road by road, riot police wielding batons, pepper spray, and grenade launchers lined every intersection&rsquo;s only entry towards Westlake. We eventually stopped. We waited and amassed before the police. SPD, seemingly threatened after being covered in harmless silly string, responded with pepper spray and even launched blast balls directly into the center of the densely crowded intersection. Another marcher was arrested. One person with a head wound had to be evacuated to Harborview hospital, and many others were treated by medics on the spot. Despite this, SPD officially claimed to the press that there were no injuries.</p>
<p>A call went out that the Westlake rally was over, and that we had won. This call was a miscommunication on our end that ultimately resulted from faulty intelligence that indicated a dispersal order was given at Westlake &ndash; and before it could be confirmed, the word eventually morphed down the chain into a story that the fascists left the park early. Nonetheless, the call was given and acted upon. We were turned back to Denny Park. Smaller groups of the bloc attempted to divert down other roads towards Westlake again, only to be stopped. Another arrest was made. Meanwhile, many gleeful activists returned to Denny Park to call it a victory. We do not feel that there was a victory.</p>
<p>While Gibson cancelled the Patriot Prayer march, we weren&rsquo;t able to confront the fascists at their rally. We were turned away from the only objective we had left. We achieved a goal of not letting them march, but at the cost of the safety of our people. The trust of the committed antifascists who were there that day was betrayed. We were glad to hear that many folks nonetheless managed to make it into Westlake for a confrontation, but only by doing so separately from the larger group. We commend all of their initiative and dedication.</p>
<p>The action attracted people who had no interest in confronting fascism, or any concept of what it means. They wanted a parade. They wanted a parade that obeyed police direction and showed off their 200-foot-long constitution banner. They believed that this was antifascist. It&rsquo;s almost funny. Fascists love parades, the constitution, and cops.</p>
<p>We failed to plan for the numbers that showed up on Sunday. We chose a tactic that was ineffective. We put people in danger by failing to create a separation between the parade group and the actual antifascist action. We didn&rsquo;t even understand what was happening until it was too late. We worked with groups that didn&rsquo;t share the same objectives. We worked with groups that could never possibly share our objectives. We will be much more mindful about this in the future.</p>
<p>Our primary goal was not met. Our people were put in harm&rsquo;s way. Our marshals were spread thin &ndash; straddling two masses at times, doing our very best to ensure that the perimeter was covered adequately. Our marshals and medics were continually distracted from their duties by the loud demands of paraders to police and suppress the antifascists for whom the march was organized. Not only did this compromise the safety of everyone, it created needless conflict between committed antifascists and those who were in over their heads. The actions of those who came for a parade sabotaged the goals of the antifascists and enabled the likes of Patriot Prayer.</p>
<p>We fucked up. It won&rsquo;t be the last time, but we learned a lot from our mistakes. Over the next few weeks and months we&rsquo;ll be thinking a lot about what happened and working on ways to improve our strategies.</p>
