<p>Fellow Workers from the Seattle IWW Industrial Union local 650 (IU650) at Grassroots Campaigns (GCI) are facing an illegal office closure by the GCI bosses in retaliation for an Unfair Labor Practice Strike action protesting egregious labor violations. Just under a week after the office closed, Wobblies at the Seattle GCI job branch called for a National Day of Action on Friday, August 10th. Wobblies in other GCI offices around the country are starting to face increased heat from management&rsquo;s aggressive union busting. Most are fighting back &ndash; and winning. Here&rsquo;s a quick roundup from each of the seven actions.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/22/2018 - 7:46pm</p>
<p><strong>By Joanna Nu&ntilde;ez - Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, August 10, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/320x196x5-15-1068x654.jpg.pagespeed.ic.7lPE1Hy4_x/" alt="" align="right" />The lockdown at Stillwater Prison is now in its 27th day. As <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/08/11/stillwater-prison-conditions-complaints/" target="_blank">families</a> and <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/?cat=1" target="_blank">prisoners</a> demand an end to the lockdown the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee is releasing <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1307eAreXim7tDMeLivaqHy1vmJ5DwsaM/view" target="_blank">audio</a> from inside Stillwater prison to showcase the urgency of the lockdown&rsquo;s immediate end and to expose the lies being spread by the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC). The audio, shared by Stillwater inmate Tony, last name removed due to concerns for retaliation, was received on August 11th.</p>
<p>This audio interview - along with other independent reports from prisoners in Stillwater - document human rights violations, the power of the media&rsquo;s impact in changing conditions inside, and, as Stillwater prisoner Carlos Smith says, that the &ldquo;[DOC] spokesperson is not being truthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Multiple independent reports from prisoners contradict the claims made by the DOC in an August 10th statement to KSTP. A DOC representative said prisoners are receiving <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/" target="_blank">&ldquo;showers every 3 days and were given hygiene bags as well as fresh linens&rdquo;</a>. Yet, prisoners report not having received more than three showers in 24 days of being locked down. Nor have Smith or Tony received clean clothes. Smith shared, &ldquo;Our clothes are mildewed because we have only had the chance to wash them once in the last 24 days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conditions inside Stillwater sound nightmarish. A prisoner who wishes to remain anonymous reports &ldquo;the stench in the units from the garbage is gagging. Fruit flies are abundant and everywhere. Toiletries are not passed out daily. Some days you find yourself having to ask your neighbors for toilet paper... [which] is prohibited&rdquo;.</p>
<p>During lockdowns prisoners are supposed to be in cells a brutal twenty three hours a day. Yet Tony reports they were &ldquo;locked in their cells...for 20 days straight&rdquo; without proper medical supervision, and when displaced for searches prisoners were surrounded by staff &ldquo;with automatic weapons and several canines&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A prisoner who wishes to remain anonymous says he &ldquo;can't stand by and allow the DOC to lie to the public, bolstering their own image to request more money off my pain and suffering. I am paying my dues to society and now the DOC's the one victimizing me for their own personal gain.&rdquo; He asks that &ldquo;[you] report the truth to the public. Open their eyes to our plight and the problem of warehousing over reintegration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some prisoners see progress being forced by stories in the news, including their first hour out of their cells during the day. &ldquo;A lot of change has occurred as people understand what is going on inside the prisons [from the TV]&rdquo; Tony reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The DOC says they are <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/" target="_blank">&ldquo;transitioning off of lockdown&rdquo;</a> but it is <a href="https://kstp.com/news/inmates-speak-out-want-stillwater-prison-lockdown-lifted-/5025771/" target="_blank">&ldquo;a process without a definitive end date&rdquo;</a>. Prisoners and their families are not willing to wait. The Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd6AsfZOtpz-ypwvJ03fe5FadjGzSJko0L6V2yI2EM1Ix0sQ/viewform" target="_blank">circulating a petition</a> demanding the DOC immediately end the lockdown at Stillwater. IWOC is calling for an emergency meeting this Sunday at 7pm for family and friends of prisoners in Stillwater to end the lockdown. &ldquo;The DOC is preventing prisoners from speaking out so we will do whatever is necessary to make their conditions heard&rdquo;, says Joanna Nu&ntilde;ez of the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 08/13/2018 - 7:59pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, August 10, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/320x196x5-15-1068x654.jpg.pagespeed.ic.7lPE1Hy4_x/" width="320" height="196" align="right" alt="" />As the Minnesota Department of Corrections <a href="https://kstp.com/news/department-of-corrections-lockdown-lifted-at-all-minnesota-prisons-except-stillwater/5020877/" target="_blank">ends its lockdown at all prisons except</a> Stillwater, prisoners there are speaking out against human rights abuses and calling for the lockdown to end.</p>
<p>According to Carlos Smith, a prisoner at Stillwater, &ldquo;we are currently without any basic humane treatment here... We still have not received any showers nor are we any closer to seeing any end to this nonsense.&rdquo; Stillwater has been locked down since <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stillwater-inmate-kills-corrections-officer/488544421/" target="_blank">a lone prisoner killed a guard</a> on July 18. When facilities are on lockdown, prisoners receive no more than one hour a day outside their cells.</p>
<p>Smith says prisoners are being held hostage in a struggle between the DOC and AFSCME prison guards, some of whom are <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/crime-and-courts/4478582-prison-shutters-site-death-stillwater-prison-may-re-purpose-workshop" target="_blank">calling for the resignation of the commissioner</a><span style="font-family:&#xA;&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black">. </span></p>
<p>Beyond the lack of laundry and showers, the 1600 men inside Stillwater are facing humiliation during the lockdown. &ldquo;They took two sections, about sixty of us, handcuffed together, naked. Then we sat like that in the gym for an hour and a half while they ransacked our cells,&rdquo; Smith reports.</p>
<p>AFSCME, the prison guard union is looking for a <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/crime-and-courts/4478582-prison-shutters-site-death-stillwater-prison-may-re-purpose-workshop" target="_blank">bigger budget for staffing</a> but David Boehnke of the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee doesn&rsquo;t believe staffing alone will reduce violence. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give respect, you won&rsquo;t get it. Overcrowding means reduced programming and inhuman conditions - violence which begets violence,&rdquo; Boehnke says. &ldquo;The solution is there. Release the thousands of people locked up for petty parole violations and reinvest that money into improving conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A 2017 study from California prisons notes a <a href="http://economics.ucr.edu/job_candidates/Kurzfeld-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">robust relationship between reducing overcrowding and lowering prison violence</a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black">. Minnesota prisons are already above maximum capacity, resulting in hundreds of people being housed in <a href="http://www.startribune.com/state-s-prisoners-decry-aimless-limbo-in-county-jails/371865301/" target="_blank">county jails</a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black"> while the prison population is projected to be <a href="http://www.startribune.com/prison-overcrowding-to-get-worse/371844582/" target="_blank">more than 1,300 people over maximum capacity by 2022</a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black">. As of July 2018 <a href="https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota Department of Corrections Adult Prison Population Summary 7-1-2018_tcm1089-347924.pdf" target="_blank">35.6% of Minnesota&rsquo;s prison admissions</a>, 2771 people, were incarcerated for crimeless <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-41909583/stories-from-the-inside-rolling-us-out-and-right-back-in" target="_blank">technical violations of parole</a>. </span></span></span></p>
<p>Beyond the recent killing, both guards and prisoners are facing increasing violence inside Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons. Without changing conditions, it is hard to see an end rising violence. But right now, Smith hopes the public will speak up to end the lockdown and its human rights abuses. &ldquo;We are just sitting in these cells smelling like billy goats,&rdquo; he says.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/01/2018 - 7:43pm</p>
<p><strong>By Seattle IWW - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/iww-canvassers-on-strike-nationwide-actions-in-support/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, July 31, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/xGroup1.jpeg.pagespeed.ic.19IPM4Db9d/" width="320" height="213" align="right" alt="" />Grassroots Campaigns, Inc. (GCI) is a nationwide, for-profit canvassing contractor which fundraises for progressive nonprofits. GCI canvassers can be seen on countless street corners in large cities and college towns, talking to folks about groups like Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and Doctors Without Borders. Despite the company&rsquo;s claims of a &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; platform, its record of worker abuse and union busting is extensive.</p>
<p>For several years now, GCI workers have attempted to organize with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Building interest has not been too much of a challenge, since idealistic folks get recruited for &ldquo;organizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;activist&rdquo; jobs, but soon find that miserable conditions lead to high turnover rates. New hires are often sympathetic to any drive to bring about change.</p>
<p>The larger hurdle in the past has been how to navigate GCI&rsquo;s blatant disregard for labor law and the challenges of keeping a campaign going in the face of constant attrition. Past drives in Portland and Ann Arbor laid some of the groundwork for how to organize, but ultimately fell short of their goals and provided valuable insight into the company&rsquo;s strategies.</p>
<p>The current campaign, originating in Seattle, has thus far been the most successful. Although workers there have faced countless abuses since going public in February, they have managed to expand the public presence of their IWW IU650 campaign to New Orleans and wider, while building out a network of support and solidarity across the country. A number of small victories so far, such as a $2/hr raise in New Orleans and the resignation of several abusive corporate-installed managers in Seattle, have fueled this rise.</p>
<p>GCI has not made the task of organizing easy. For a week-and-a-half in June, the company illegally locked out its Seattle office in retaliation for a union action demanding better training and onboarding for new hires. The lockout was broken through nationwide direct action and legal threats, but since reopening the company has waged an all-out war on its workers. Workers around the country have been faced with direct sabotage by the company and numerous illegal unilateral changes to working conditions. To top it all off, three workers in different cities were illegally fired in July amidst a cloud of blatant lies and deceptions from the company.</p>
<p>With this latest attack, GCI workers across the country were forced to fight back. On Friday, July 27, Seattle IU650 members kicked things off with a strike against the company&rsquo;s unfair labor practices. In seven other cities, actions took place aimed at building the union&rsquo;s shop-floor presence and forcing the company to do right.</p>
<p>IU650 members are united in demanding the rehiring of all those impacted by the company&rsquo;s illegal union busting, improvements to the company&rsquo;s harsh quota system, and protections in the case of bad weather, street harassment, and other issues that might force canvassers to drop shifts. In addition, they are working to fight unique local challenges ranging from lockouts to laundry.</p>

<p>On July 18, <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/assault-corrections-officer-stillwater-minnesota-department-of-corrections/4993759/">the first prison guard in Minnesota&rsquo;s history was killed</a>, on top of recent violence in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaaltv.com/news/attacks-assault-oak-parks-prison-rise-officers-police-riot-inmates-sad/4872337/">Oak Park Heights</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/minnesota-inmate-accused-in-guards-death-has-violent-past/ar-AAAisdK">Stillwater prisons</a>. Yet all the DOC does is ask for <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/department-corrections-commissioner-tom-roy-plans-request-more-funding-from-legislature-again/5006544/">more money</a> on top of their <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/deadly-prison-attack-stillwater-joseph-gomm-minnesota-department-corrections/4996735/">1.2 billion dollar budget</a>. We need a new approach to change in Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons. Stop putting money into a violent institution that is not correcting anyone. Free our people, and reinvest savings into reentry and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>For those of us who have been incarcerated or in regular contact with Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons, recent violence is not a surprise &ndash; it&rsquo;s an inevitability due to the behavior of the prisons system itself.</p>

<li>Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons have gotten progressively worse. Lip service to rehabilitation has little application to daily realities, while harsher parole practices, sentencing, and increased criminalization of our communities have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2015/06/minnesota-crime-50-year-low-so-why-are-we-imprisoning-more-people-ever">manufactured an overcrowding crisis</a>. And our people are dying. Between 2000-2013,<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/naacpmpls/posts/2083555125298992"> 280 people incarcerated in Minnesota prisons were killed</a> &ndash; 75% of them due to medical neglect. Yet we spend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vera.org/publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends-prison-spending">$41,366 per incarcerated person each year</a>.</li>
<li>Many prison guards in Minnesota are racist and abusive. The day before the killing at Stillwater, a prisoner reported that the man killed was telling everyone that &ldquo;guards can do whatever we want to you and you can&rsquo;t do anything about it&rdquo;. Last year the Twin Cities Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee released a <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-41909583/stories-from-the-inside-because-they-have-the-badge">podcast</a> just scratching the surface of guard abuse in Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons.</li>
<li>It is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2014/apr/15/lowering-recidivism-through-family-communication/">well documented</a>, including by the <a target="_blank" href="https://mn.gov/doc/family-visitor/visiting-information/">MN DOC</a>, that increased community connection reduces recidivism. Yet the MN DOC regularly prevents mail delivery, makes visiting miserable, and represses prisoner and community attempts to build bridges with each other. Results are predictable: <a target="_blank" href="http://justicelab.iserp.columbia.edu/states/Minnesota.html">48% of people released on parole end up back in prison</a>, a shocking <a target="_blank" href="https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota Department of Corrections Adult Prison Population Summary 1-1-2018_tcm1089-323881.pdf">88% of them</a> for minor &ldquo;technical violations&rdquo; of parole, not new crimes. Even DOC employees are saying <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inforum.com/news/crime-and-courts/4474871-coworkers-vow-fight-more-staff-minnesota-prison-where-guard-was-killed">low staffing</a> in overcrowded conditions are creating extreme dangers for prisoners and staff, while a <a target="_blank" href="https://kstp.com/news/deadly-prison-attack-stillwater-joseph-gomm-minnesota-department-corrections/4996735/">rash of quitting</a> has followed the recent killing.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s an easy solution to these violent conditions &ndash; free our people. Instead of putting yet more money into prisons we should immediately release all people in prison for crimeless &ldquo;technical violations&rdquo; of parole and nonviolent crimes, <a target="_blank" href="https://mn.gov/doc/assets/Minnesota Department of Corrections Adult Prison Population Summary 1-1-2018_tcm1089-323881.pdf">at least 40% of the population</a>. Savings should fund successful reentry and rehabilitation programs. The parole system must be changed to ensure everyone has the opportunity to earn a life worth living. <i>(Learn more about </i><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3hCKJLltmvYVdMGy_g1LZO983Eu7VLzL7ZyK4zhLyosHEkg/viewform"><i>this fight</i></a><i> on Saturday August 25th, 1-3pm in North Minneapolis &ndash; </i><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11PWiDRkGprkmkV_qEFPd2ZUPVScjDX4D/view"><i>flier</i></a><i> and </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/227466424566704/"><i>facebook</i></a><i>).</i></p>
<p>Nor can conditions be improved without prisoners having real power and community connections. Prisoners should be allowed to form their own unions and represent themselves. Community groups and family members should be welcomed. Visiting hours should be expanded, while mail censorship must end.</p>
<p>This August 21st &ndash; September 9th, prisoners around the country are <a target="_blank" href="http://prisonstrike.com/">going on strike</a> against inhuman conditions confirmed by prisoners&rsquo; legal status as slaves under the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">13th am</a><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">endment to the US Constitution</a>. Will Minnesota&rsquo;s prisons join other systems in regular deadly violence between slaves and their cagers? Or will we treat humans like human beings, stop senseless incarceration, and use savings for rehabilitation and community? We say slavery must end &ndash; free our people!</p>
