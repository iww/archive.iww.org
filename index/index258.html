We are happy to report the Cheesecake Factory has finally settled and workers will finally get their rightful piece of the pie. For three years, workers were denied breaks in the busiest and most profitable restaurant in the City. After two years of actions, worker organizing and public pressure, we won back pay and a new system! Workers across the state will get a $4.5 million settlement. </p> <p> Through the course of the campaign, they&rsquo;ve also won increased wages for the breaker position, instead of paying the breaking worker to take a break. We&rsquo;ve built a solid crew in the kitchen who are standing up to abusive managers. In perhaps unrelated news, former General Manager Jeff Reznick has been transferred to Pensacola, a little town in mid-Florida.
