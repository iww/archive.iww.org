I didn&rsquo;t hear one speech and never even made it to the Loop where the march was supposed to end. There was just this sea of humanity gathered in the streets, flowing in the same direction with the same object in mind: defeat the new, draconian immigration bill known as &ldquo;The Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005&rdquo; (HR4437).</p> <p>On March 10 at least 300,000 people took the day off work or school and converged in Chicago&rsquo;s Loop to protest this bill, which would turn undocumented workers into &ldquo;aggravated criminal felons&rdquo; and those who assist them, such as priests and nurses (and unionists) into criminals as well for &ldquo;aiding and abetting&rdquo; them. The bill passed the House of Representatives just before Christmas, it is currently being debated in the Senate.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

The settlement stemmed from disputes at just three stores in New York City and will likely have little impact on the vast majority of Starbucks workers. But it illustrates the careful approach the company is taking toward labor activists as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other union targets try to rebuild their images after union campaigns tarnished their reputations.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

<p><em><u>Disclaimer</u> - The following article is reposted here because it is an issue with some relevance to the IWW. The views of the author do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.</em></p><p><strong>Reposted from <a href="https://libcom.org/news/article.php/france-new-protests-160306" target="_self">www.libcom.org</a> - March 20, 2006</strong></p><p><img width="244" height="197" border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/syndicalism/we_are_all_spain36.gif" />A fresh wave of protests has hit France as students, school pupils and workers continue the occupations, blockades and rioting against the first employment contract (CPE).<br /><br />This is just a short summary of the events being updated regularly on <a href="https://www.libcom.org/blog/" target="_self">http://libcom.org/blog</a> - the most comprehensive and up-to-date English coverage of the struggle against the CPE anywhere on the web.<br /><br />Scores of high schools and around 70% of universities are occupied today.<br /><br />In many areas teachers have been joining their pupils in the protests, with several thousands demonstrating in Limoges, Boulougne, Le Havre and many other towns and cities across France.<br /><br />The Monteil school in Rodez, the largest school in Aveyron with 1,600 pupils, was occupied and shut down with barricades. Fifteen schools in Seine-Saint-Denis, the scene of last years riots by suburban youths, are occupied. Many young people from the banlieus are preparing to join in the demonstration in Paris later today. Around 1,000 high school pupils have blocked a motorway in Nice whilst 200 pupils did the same in Vitry-on-Seine.<br /><br />This is a strong sign that the struggle is circulating and extending outside the universities to France's disaffected working class youth - the focus of mass civil unrest in November last year. The increasing numbers of lecturers and teachers on strike and supporting the protests, and the railway and motorway blockades, along with support from France's major unions, all point to a struggle which is encompassing an ever wider section of France's society.<br /><br />To keep up-to-date on the events in France, look at <a href="https://www.libcom.org/blog/" target="_self">http://libcom.org/blog</a> <br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_34 first"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/educational-worker/" rel="tag" title="All workers in educational institutions.">Educational Workers Industrial Union 620</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_422 last"><a href="../category/campaigns/issue-oriented-campaigns/international-solidarity/" rel="tag" title="International Solidarity">International Solidarity</a></li></ul> </div>
