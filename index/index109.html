</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 10/04/2010 - 7:32pm</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns3.jpg" align="right" />In the last two weeks, many of us at Jimmy John's have had to sit through mandatory meetings with Rebecca Smith and Joe Brock. Rebecca Smith and Joe Brock claim that they just want to give us information so we can decide for ourselves if we want to form a union. The truth is that they are from <b>Labor Relations Institute, Inc., a third-party anti-union company hired by Mike and Rob Mulligan</b>. LRI promises employers that if they are hired, workers will be unable to form a union, <i>or your money back</i>. Their standard fee is $3000 per day, $375 an hour. Do you think the Mulligans pay these people hundreds of dollar an hour to be a neutral voice? Since September 15, we estimate they have been paid $45,000 by the Mulligans, or enough to give every Jimmy Johns worker $200 cash. In a recent campaign against workers organizing a union at Soaring Eagle Casino, LRI made $1.5 million total for their work. Rebecca Smith and Joe Brock have a financial interest in convincing you to vote no. They have a history of using misrepresentations, lies, and subtle threats to divide and conquer workers. Do they deserve our trust? No!</p>
<p>Here is more information about this pair that they have been hiding.</p>
<p><b>Rebecca Smith</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Claims to have worked as a union organizer. We contacted the Teamster union local she worked for when she lived near Pahrump, NV. They said she never worked as an organizer. She ran a program that taught people things like asbestos safety and forklift driving. That means she's lying to us.</li>
<li>Claims she voluntarily quit her paid position in the Teamsters union. The truth is her own coworkers petitioned to have her removed from union office because of her gross incompetence.</li>
<li>Was paid $103,031 for her work in a union-busting campaign at Soaring Eagle Casinos in Michigan in 2007. What did you get paid in 2007? Rebecca Smith gets a fat salary for union-busting, she doesn't know and doesn't care about what our lives are like.</li>
<li>Kicked out of her own union, Rebecca Smith now travels around the country making misleading and manipulative statements about unions for employers.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Joe Brock</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Claims he was a union organizer. The truth is he was a highly paid official, not an organizer.</li>
<li>Was happy to earn more than $80,000 per year from the Teamsters, then took a pay raise to attack the union members who gave him such a comfortable life style.</li>
<li>Claims to be a Teamster who left because of problems in the labor movement. He doesn't tell us that he lost an election for office and then sued over losing. The Department of Labor ruled Brock’s claims against his local were baseless. So he quit and became a professional union buster.</li>
<li>Claims his job as an anti-union consultant lets him help workers improve their lives on the job. Do you really think the Mulligans all of a sudden decided bring Brock here for $3,000 per day to improve conditions? Brock is not here to improve workers’ lives. He is here to earn a buck preventing us from having more input into how this place is run.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>These are the facts. Decide for yourself, who do you trust? Highly paid outsiders like Rebecca Smith and Joe Brock, or your own co-workers who want all Jimmy John’s employees to have more voice on the job?</b></p>
<p>All of the information in this note is based on research gathered from US Department of Labor reports and given to us by unions that Rebecca Smith and Joe Brock worked for or were members of. If you'd like to see the documentation, we'd be happy to show it to you.

<a href="../node/5218/" rel="bookmark">At Jimmy Johns, Allegations of Illegal Union-Busting as NLRB Election Approaches</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 10/01/2010 - 2:08pm</p>
<p><b>Labor Rights Violations Stack up as Sandwich Chain Turns to 'Union Avoidance' Consultants</b></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/buskers1.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS– Jimmy John's will face a government investigation of 14 alleged violations of the National Labor Relations Act at ten Minneapolis locations, the IWW Jimmy John's Workers Union announced today. The sandwich workers union has filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge accusing company owners Mike and Rob Mulligan of engaging in a pattern of labor rights violations ranging from physical intimidation and threats against union members, to tightening of company policies in retaliation for union activity. </p>
<p>“When we formed the union, we were hoping to just be able to sit down with Mike and Rob to talk about some basic improvements- sick days, basic respect, and a pay raise above minimum wage. We are dismayed that Jimmy John's has opted to bring in high-priced anti-union consultants and attempt to illegally union-bust rather than just come to the table,”
said Ayo Collins, a member of the union.</p>

<p>Franchise owners Mike and Rob Mulligan have refused to meet with their employees to discuss their issues, prompting the sandwich workers to file for a National Labor Relations Board union election. The Labor Board recently announced that the election will be held on October 22.</p>
<p>If a majority of Minneapolis Jimmy Johns workers vote in favor of the union, the Mulligans will be legally required to negotiate in good faith over the terms of a contract.</p>
<p>In response to the union campaign, Jimmy Johns has contracted with Labor Relations Institute, Inc., a third party anti-union consultancy firm, to mount a comprehensive attack on union supporters. With the aid of Labor Relations Institute, the Mulligans have begun a series of 'captive audience meetings,' requiring their employees to watch anti-union videos in an attempt to break support for unionization. Other aspects of the anti-union campaign have crossed over into illegality, with reports of management threats, intimidation, and retaliation against union members surfacing across Minneapolis.</p>
<p>According to a 2009 report on employer responses to union organizing by noted Cornell University labor scholar Kate Bronfenbrenner, 63% of employers interrogate workers in mandatory one-on-one meetings about support for the union, 54% of employers threaten workers in such meetings, 47% of employers threaten to cut wages and benefits, 34% of employers fire workers, and 28% attempt to infiltrate the organizing committee. Due to these factors, only 45% of NLRB elections conducted from 1999-2003 resulted in a union victory.</p>
<p>In large part because of harsh employer opposition, union density in the food service industry hovers around a mere 1.8%. A union victory at Jimmy Johns could be a major breakthrough for labor in an industry where unions have struggled to gain a foothold, even as an increasing number of Americans find themselves employed in fast food.</p>

<a href="../node/5217/" rel="bookmark">Historic First in Nation&#039;s Fast Food Industry, 200 Jimmy Johns Workers to Vote in NLRB Union Election on October 22</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 10/01/2010 - 1:58pm</p>
<p><b>Potential Turning Point for Labor as Millions in Service Sector Face Deepening Poverty</b></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/dinkytown.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS– The National Labor Relations Board confirmed today that it will conduct a union election for 200 workers at ten Minneapolis-area Jimmy John's on October 22, an historic first in the nation's almost entirely non-union fast food industry. The secret ballot union election could be a turning point for labor at a time of deepening poverty for millions of Americans affected by the recession, many of whom are employed in low-wage service sector jobs.</p>
<p>“People who thought of themselves as middle class or upwardly-mobile two years ago are now making minimum wage at Jimmy John's, with no real prospects for moving up. If these are the kinds of jobs that American workers will be stuck with, then we are going to make them quality jobs for working families,” said Mike Wilkow, a union member at Jimmy Johns.</p>
<p>If a majority of workers vote in favor of unionization, the company will be legally bound to negotiate with a bargaining team elected by its employees.</p>
<p>The unprecedented fast food union campaign at Jimmy John's comes at a time of deepening economic misery for US workers. According to a recent report by the US Census Bureau, a record-breaking 43.6 million Americans– 1 in 7 people– are living in poverty. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the unemployment rate at 9.6%, with 14.9 million people out of work and uncounted millions more too discouraged to look for work. Layoffs and outsourcing have decimated higher-paid jobs, particularly strongholds of unionization such as manufacturing and construction, forcing many workers to seek employment in low-wage areas of the economy once reserved for teenagers and students. For many, it feels like food service and retail are the only jobs left.</p>
<p>While many workers are forced to seek employment in food service, industry wages and working conditions are widely regarded as substandard; in 2009, the median wage in the fast food industry was $8.28/hr and as of July 2010, the average workweek in fast food was only
24.3 hours. The median annual income for fast food workers is $10,462, or $871 per month. This is less than half the federal poverty line of
$21,954 for a family of four, and below the federal poverty line of $
10,830 for an individual. Jimmy John's is below industry standards, paying most workers the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr, scheduling most workers less than 20 hours/week, and offering no benefits.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 10/01/2010 - 12:58pm</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU610/NBS1.jpg" align="right" />Workers at Birmingham's NHS Blood & Transplant centre in Edgbaston have just successfully organised to get a hot food canteen through a popular campaign.</p>
<p>Earlier this year office staff moved into former lab space left empty following cuts and closures. This influx highlighted and reminded people just how poor the existing catering on site was. Years ago there had been a full canteen serving cooked breakfast and the like, but the contract was operated by a local hospital and when that ended, no-one was willing to take it on, so the canteen was closed. Since then all that staff have had is over-priced vending machines which supply only salty, fatty and sugary junk food, and are frequently half empty. The dry sandwiches are universally hated. Considering the employer is the NHS, it seemed not a lot of thought had gone into how what employees eat effects our health, fitness, well-being, energy and concentration - especially those who work shifts.</p>
<p>This issue was something that absolutely everybody felt strongly about, so it was decided that instead of grumbling, which achieves nothing, a Campaign for a Canteen would be launched. The UNISON branch agreed to give the campaign its full backing. A petition was circulated and was signed by all, even visiting managers from other centres. An open meeting was also held so that ideas could be brainstormed to go into a written case.</p>
<p>Members of UNISON, Unite, IWW and also non-union members all came up with very strong arguments. The case was put together and presented to management along with pages of signatures, and a right earful from some of the most fired-up staff! Then, once we had made our case, many of us helped to keep the pressure up by sending the regional manager regular individual emails.</p>
<p>In the end management felt that our case was quite simply so strong and logical on all fronts that the only choice they had was to concede to our demand. Now we will be getting a full serving hatch which will give us access to hot fresh food and fruit and veg. This will be a good boost to morale and hopefully to people's health as well. Birmingham blood centre has lost a lot in the past few years and it's about time that we got something back! But this wasn't a gift - the truth is we wouldn't have got it if we hadn't organised.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_410 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/british-isles-regional-administration/" rel="tag" title="British Isles Regional Administration">British Isles Regional Administration</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_33 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/health-service-wor/" rel="tag" title="All workers employed in hospitals and health restoration services.">Health Service Workers Industrial Union 610</a></li></ul> </div>
