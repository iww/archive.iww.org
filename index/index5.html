<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/IWW_Dialysis_Care_workers.png" width="241" height="456" align="right" alt="" />The dialysis workers of Humboldt County are going IWW. Worsening working conditions at the only two dialysis clinics in the County, both owned by the German based company Fresenius, has culminated in a unionization drive that continues to grow momentum. Lives in the community are being put at risk as individual technicians are being routinely forced to take care of 6 to 8 patients at a time for 10 to 16 hour shifts. Grossly underpaid and overworked dialysis technicians who fear for their patients safety, have pleaded for years for more staff, more consistent scheduling, better training and fair pay. Having union representation has been a subject fraught with fear and secrecy at a company whose new hire orientation process consists of having to sit through an anti-union information video. However, workers feel they have run out of options. A proposed law in California would make it illegal to have more than three dialysis patients for every dialysis technician. If passed, the law still wouldn&rsquo;t be enacted until 2020; however, staff is refusing to wait any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">For years staff and patient&rsquo;s concerns have been ignored by corporate and has continued to reveal a disconnection from a company that has put cutting costs over the well being of its clients and workers alike. The company hasn&rsquo;t wasted any time combating organizing efforts, less than a week after formally announcing their intentions to have a union; corporate has called for &ldquo;mandatory informational meetings&rdquo;. These captive audience meetings are forcing staff into separated groups to sit through an hour and a half of management and HR agents trying to convince them in vague terms that conditions will get better and that they don&rsquo;t need to be union. A patient advocate, who is a patient themselves, was forcibly excluded from the meetings. Ironically Fresenius had to bring in temporary (traveling) workers to perform their duties while staff was in these meetings. In the months prior, shortly after hearing of union activity, management brought in a nurse from corporate&rsquo;s employee relations department. Along with distributing a poster designed to scare workers from giving personal information to union organizers, they were caught in a lie on day one by claiming that the IWW &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t apply to our work because they only organize factories and sex workers&rdquo;. One of management&rsquo;s main tactics is trying to attack the union&rsquo;s legitimacy in the healthcare industry. The election for union representation set to take place June 7th and 8th.</span></p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 05/15/2018 - 7:50pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-wins-second-victory/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, May 14, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/BVWU2018S_0.jpg" width="320" height="186" align="right" alt="" />The following statement was released yesterday from the Burgerville Workers Union, after another store successfully won union recognition. The BVWU is the first officially recognized fast food union in the United States and is a part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</span></em></p>
<p>Today Burgerville workers once again voted overwhelmingly in favor of the BVWU, this time at the Gladstone location. This is the second NLRB election the BVWU has won in a month. The first, at 92nd and Powell, made us the only fast food union in the country, and this one demonstrates the momentum the BVWU has going into contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Gladstone workers in particular deserve extra celebration for their win today. Despite the friendly attitude Burgervi<span class="text_exposed_show">lle has taken in the press about being willing to work with the union, Gladstone workers didn&rsquo;t see anything close to friendliness on the shop floor. During the election, despite all their words of openness and cooperation, Burgerville was up to its old tricks: retaliation, intimidation, even straight up lying. Gladstone workers faced down all of that and STILL won a major victory for the union. Standing up to your boss like that takes bravery and every one of them deserves applause.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>The win at 92nd wasn&rsquo;t the end of the fight, and neither is this win at Gladstone. The fight won&rsquo;t be over until Burgerville stops paying us poverty wages, stops threatening undocumented immigrants through their use of e-verify, and stops treating us like we&rsquo;re disposable. We demand respect, and we won&rsquo;t stop until we get it. Gladstone is an important step in that journey.</p>
<p>Remember too that the boycott is on until the company signs a fair contract. They&rsquo;re not off the hook yet.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 04/30/2018 - 1:45pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-union-becomes-first-formally-recognized-fast-food-union-in-us/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, April 24, 2018</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><img src="../sites/default/files/images/Burgerville.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="220" align="right" />Burgerville Workers Union has won a union election in one location, meaning that the company will be forced to negotiate a contract with the workers. Other stores are expected to soon come on board. BVWU, a part of the IWW, also becomes the first fast food chain in the US to be unionized. </em></span></p>
<p>We won the election. We did it. We made history.</p>
<p>Today workers at 92nd and Powell overwhelmingly voted yes, making the Burgerville Workers Union the only formally recognized fast food union in the country. For a long time people have dismissed fast food as unorganizable, saying that turnover is too high, or the workers are too spread out. Today Burgerville workers proved them wrong.</p>
<p>The fight isn&rsquo;t over, of course. We still need to bargain a fair contract with Burgerville, an<span class="text_exposed_show">d until then the boycott still stands. And we need to remember what got us to this point: workers taking action for themselves, standing up against poverty wages and horrible conditions. We got here because of the strike, union benefits, pickets, and marches on the boss. We got here through direct action, and that won&rsquo;t change now that we&rsquo;ve won an election. If anything it&rsquo;s even more important.</span></p>
<p>In this moment of victory we want to celebrate, yes, but we also want to turn our attention to the 4.5 million other fast food workers in the United States. We want to speak to everyone else who works for poverty wages, who are constantly disrespected on the job, who are told they aren&rsquo;t educated enough, aren&rsquo;t experienced enough, aren&rsquo;t good enough for a decent life. To all of those workers, to everyone like us who works rough jobs for terrible pay, we say this:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to that bullshit. Burgerville workers didn&rsquo;t, and look at us now.</p>
<p>Because our win today isn&rsquo;t just about Burgerville. It&rsquo;s about history. It&rsquo;s about a movement of workers who know that a better world is possible, and that together they can make that world real.</p>
<p>Today we became the only recognized fast food union in the country. But we won&rsquo;t be the only one for long.</p>

<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/Page%203_0.jpg" align="right" alt="" />May Day!</p>
<p>Long a celebration of renewal, as Spring shows its stuff with abundance in Nature, May 1 was the perfect day for workers to come out in their numbers, celebrating their unity and strength in demanding the eight-hour workday and safe working conditions. It took anarchists and socialists to stand up to the money men and demand what simply should have been a right of Nature, which knows how to take a good rest to gear up for astonishing productivity.</p>
<p>There's a third meaning to &quot;Mayday,&quot; but it's just as appropriate to our movement as the connection to Nature is to dignity for all workers. We've heard it in countless war movies: &quot;Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!&quot; It has to be said three times to work, just like Dorothy's clicking her heels to &quot;There's no place like home!&quot; and &quot;Oyez, oyez, oyez!&quot; (Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!) to call a court to order.</p>
<p>&quot;M'aidez, m'aidez, m'aidez!&quot; It means &quot;Help me.&quot; That's what Wobblies do. It's solidarity, Fellow Workers!</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 03/14/2018 - 1:58pm</p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/sfu.jpg" width="200" height="226" align="right" alt="" />Stardust Family United, a solidarity union of the Industrial Workers of the World, has claimed a huge victory over the repressive owner of Ellen&rsquo;s Stardust Diner (home of the world famous singing waitstaff), Ken Sturm.&nbsp; In the largest settlement received by the IWW in recent history, Sturm has succumbed to the will of his workers and started payment of almost half a million dollars in back wages.</p>
<p>In September, just one week before a scheduled hearing to settle allegations of 19 Unfair Labor Practices, including illegal surveillance of employees engaged in protected concerted activity, the interrogation of employees regarding union activity, and the unlawful termination of thirty-one employees for organizing, Sturm reluctantly offered reinstatement to all thirty-one employees and agreed to cease harassment and surveillance of the union. Although the employer also agreed to pay back wages, it should come as no surprise that Sturm strung his former employees along for another four months, through the holiday season, before finally bowing to the power of the workers and starting payment of the $490,000 he owes them.</p>
<p>Stardust Family United was formed in 2016, in an effort to fight for the underserved employees of Ellen's Stardust Diner in their struggle against the unfair, unsafe, and unlawful labor practices of their employer. Blatant disregard for the workers' well-being ranged from ignoring pleas to fix dangerous equipment in the shop, resulting in multiple injuries on the job, to bullying tactics designed to shut down communication between employees. Undeterred, the members of SFU waged a struggle in the shop, in the streets, and in the courtroom. By refusing unsafe or unpaid work, the singing servers have dramatically improved conditions on the job. Through protests, pickets, and walkouts, they placed pressure on the boss to re-hire the illegally terminated workers. And despite Sturm's repeated attempts to break their spirit with shameful tactics, from hateful "anonymous" text messages to false allegations in a NY Post article, SFU has stood their ground every single time. And every single time, they've won.</p>
<p>With invaluable support from the One Big Union, SFU has been relentless in holding Sturm and his army of corrupt lawyers and dictatorial managers accountable for their actions. Now that back wages are being paid to those illegally terminated, an injustice has been righted.</p>
