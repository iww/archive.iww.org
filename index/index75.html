<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 07/08/2012 - 11:05pm</p>
<p><i>The following campaign involved members of the IWW and Earth First!</i></p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/06/pa-fracking-eviction" target="_blank">By Xian Chiang-Waren - <i>Mother Jones</i> June 22, 2012</a></b></p>
<p>When the 32 families of the Riverdale Mobile Home Park in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania, found out that they were losing their homes to the state's latest fracking operation, the news didn't come from their landlord, or an eviction notice in the mail&mdash;they read about it in their morning paper.</p>
<p>The February 18 article, published in the <i>Williamsport Sun-Gazette</i>, nonchalantly detailed the approval of three natural gas projects in Lycoming County, PA, including a water withdrawal station that would pipe millions of gallons of water from the Susquehanna River to fracking stations in the mountains further north. The article noted that an &quot;added benefit&quot; of the plans was &quot;the removal of mobile homes,&quot; which were located in a potential flood plain.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, Riverdale's landlord came by and confirmed what residents had already read in the paper: The property had been sold to Aqua America, a water company dedicated to fracking. The full magnitude of the blow came days later, when the eviction notices arrived, informing the residents that they had until May 1 to relocate so that work on the site could begin in June. Each family was offered $2,500 if they got off the property by April 1; $1,500 if they moved by May 1; and zero compensation after that. It wasn't nearly enough; lawyers for Riverdale residents later estimated that the cost of moving each trailer was, on average, between $8,000 to $10,000.</p>
<p>For communities on the Rust Belt, it's one of the oldest stories in the book: A new industry comes in and needs to build roadways or pipelines, and poor communities have to get out of its way. &quot;This happens all the time in Pennsylvania,&quot; said Alex Lotorto, a Pennsylvania activist and delegate for the union group Industrial Workers of the World. &quot;Industry comes in and uses our skilled labor. Then both government and industry end up abusing us because honestly, nobody even thinks about the people north of I-80.&quot;</p>
<p>But in Riverdale, something unexpected happened: People decided they weren't going to go quietly.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 07/08/2012 - 10:48pm</p>
<p><b><a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2012/06/08/striking-back-at-bosses-solidarity-networks-and-sexual-assualt/">By Juan Conatz - The Organizer, June 8, 2012</a></b></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/bossgetsit.gif" style="width: 250px; height: 339px;" />In the IWW, we sometimes have to deal with two different problems: How do we approach situations where we have left our job (but still have a problem with our employer) and how do we deal with harassment and assault in the workplace?</p>
<p>Wobblies in Seattle have taken on the first question. Wanting to build organizing skills and fight back against bosses and landlords in their area, they started the Seattle Solidarity Network (&lsquo;SeaSol&rsquo;).</p>
<p>SeaSol is a network of volunteers, open to workers both employed and unemployed, that takes on workplace and housing fights through a strategy of escalation of tactics. For instance, a tenant is denied their security deposit. Attempts to contact the landlord are ignored or delayed. SeaSol will march in with 30 people and hand the landlord a demand letter telling them to give the renter their deposit in a certain amount of time or else. If the landlord doesn&rsquo;t give in, pickets will follow, and so on.</p>
<p>Harassment and assault in the workplace is something that has been less thought about by union organizers or the left in general, even less than the fights SeaSol typically takes on. Some of us in the union have briefly addressed sexual harassment on shopfloor, but it&rsquo;s still an ongoing conversation. Seemingly not talked about at all is the issue of assault, sexual or otherwise. During the 1990s (the latest period with statistics I could easily find), there was an average of 35,000 incidents of workplace sexual assault each year.</p>
<p>What should be our response when this happens? What can our response be? In the following situation, these two problems intersected, and Wobblies came up with a way to address it.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2012/05/16/may-1st-in-the-twin-cities/" target="_blank">By Elijah Marks - <i>The Organizer</i> May 16, 2012</a></b><br />

The celebration of International Workers&rsquo; Day in the Twin Cities brought together many groups organizing around various struggles. The resurgent Occupy movement has injected new energy into the holiday.<br />
<br />
Local organizing coalesced in an Occupy May 1st Twin Cities group, planning for a day of action around &lsquo;no work, no school&rsquo; and a &lsquo;day without the 99%&rsquo; For months leading up to the action, they met weekly at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)&rsquo;s office to coordinate with other groups, plan events for the day, and make and spread posters and leaflets.<br />
<br />
The mutual aid ethos of the wider Occupy movement was demonstrated through Occuprint, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street in New York City, who helped with May 1st publicity in the Twin Cities&mdash;and other cities across the country&mdash;by distributing hundreds of high-quality, large-format posters and newspapers. Additionally, local designers created their own innovative designs, such as the following poster:<br />
<br />
Another form of circulation of common media across the country was a zine with an illustrated history of May Day. During the meet-up at the beginning of the day, I found this zine to be a useful means for meeting new people and sparking conversations. Talking about this history made us feel connected with the tradition of struggle for immigrants&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; rights, such as the 8-hour workday, that most people take for granted, and seeing that nothing will be gained&mdash;and much could be lost&mdash;without continued militant struggle.<br />
