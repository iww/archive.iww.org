</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 07/21/2011 - 1:22pm</p>
<p>Early&nbsp; morning contract cleaners hired by the City of London at Guildhall have staged a two day strike in protest at unpaid wages. The 34 cleaners only get the minimum wage, but even then cleaning contractor Ocean has underpaid many of them continuously over the last 3 months, despite asking them to work extra hours.<br />
<br />
Their&nbsp; patience ran out on Tuesday 14 and Wednesday 15 June, when those still unpaid refused to lift a finger until the company gave them assurances&nbsp; they would be paid. Their other workmates agreed to stay put with them&nbsp; in the reception area in solidarity for the duration of their two hour&nbsp; shift. The situation is now on a knife edge, with&nbsp; the company issuing some &quot;amended&quot; payslips, and promising that the rest&nbsp; of the shortfall will be made good this week and in next month?s pay&nbsp; packet.<br />
<br />
The&nbsp; workers, who hail from many different countries, are meanwhile presenting a collective grievance and have vowed to protest if the company fails to come up with the goods. They belong to the IWW's 640 (Cleaners and Allied Trades) branch. The last visible protest movements by City cleaners were at UBS's Liverpool Street offices in 2010 and the Willis Building in 2009.<br />

<p><strong>By Julie Jargon - <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, July 6, 2011</strong></p>
<p>In what would be Starbucks Corp.'s first strike at a company-owned store, baristas at the chain's outlets in Chile plan to walk out Thursday because, they say, their wages are so low that they can't afford to buy lunch.</p>
<p>Unionized employees at 30 of Starbucks's 31 Chilean stores plan to walk out for as many as several days, said Andr?s Giordano, president of the union, Sindicato de Trabajadores de Starbucks Coffee Chile.</p>
<p>Mr. Giordano, a 24-year-old shift supervisor in Santiago, said the starting hourly wage for Chilean Starbucks workers is the equivalent of $2.50, and it hasn't changed in eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;Lunch in Chile costs $5 to $6,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Chilean workers have been pressing for a lunch stipend since they organized two years ago. Starbucks managers in Chile get a monthly &quot;lunch bonus&quot; of $50, while other employees are offered two free coffees a day. &quot;I would prefer to eat a sandwich,&quot; Mr. Giordano said.</p>
<p>The skirmish underscores one of the challenges U.S.-based companies like Starbucks face as they expand their global footprint. Multinational companies seeking to enter new markets often have to deal with local labor groups and government requirements to honor collective bargaining.</p>
<p>As a condition of merging with African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently agreed to honor union-bargaining agreements for three years.</p>
<p>Starbucks has had to comply with government-mandated participation in collective-bargaining agreements in Brazil and Argentina. The company has also clashed with workers who tried unsuccessfully to organize in Europe and New Zealand, and it has battled with unionized workers in North America, where 300 employees are members of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.</p>

<a href="../history/library/misc/OReillyHoldren2011/" rel="bookmark">Two Concepts For IWW Organizing: Industrial Unionism And One Big Unionism</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>By John O&rsquo;Reilly and Nate Hawthorne - <em>Industrial Worker</em>, June 2011</strong></p>
<p>This article is the first in a series discussing the themes of the One Big Union and Industrial Unionism. We believe these themes are relevant to the future of our organization. Through these articles, we hope to push for a discussion about possible ways forward for the IWW and how we can get from where we are to where we need to be to build a new society. We welcome replies, whether in print or sent to us in private at crashcourse666 [at] gmail.com.</p>
<p>The question &ldquo;how do we best organize the working class?&rdquo; has been on the minds of many of our members recently. Our organization is small, but we have made great strides towards creating a model that builds power for working people. We have one of the best member training programs in any union in North America and Europe, we are building solidarity with working people&rsquo;s organizations in our communities and around the world, and we are continually raising our own bar by taking on and winning bigger fights with bosses. As we continue to build the IWW, sometimes the ideas we have about how our organization ought to function come into conflict with the way that our organization actually functions. These conflicts require us to develop our ideas about revolutionary unionism in the long-term and in our day-to-day activity.</p>
<p>In this article, we reflect on ideas that have been around in our organization for a long time: One Big Unionism and Industrial Unionism. Reflecting on the relationship between these ideas and how they relate to our organizing can help clarify both our thoughts and our actions. By understanding how these ideas both overlap and conflict, we want to set the stage for a larger discussion about our organization.</p>
<p>One Big Unionism is the idea that guides us in the work of building the IWW as a revolutionary organization. It is a way to think about the organizing work that we do and the reasons we do this work. The One Big Union is the idea that we want the entire working class to be united to act in our interests as a class and against capitalism. The united working class must cross geographic, cultural, and industrial boundaries, be democratic, and be able to coordinate and marshal the forces of workers against the united power of the bosses and their rule over our lives and communities.</p>
<p>We in the IWW believe that the working class needs to be unified to fight the battle for economic democracy. We are One Big Unionists because we are committed to uniting all workers across industries and crafts and because we believe work under capitalism shares basic, fundamental similarities. While we do different kinds of work, we have the same basic role in the economy: we&rsquo;re the people that make our society run but who have no power over how it is run. One of the most important lessons that we have learned in the last few years in our organizing is that because we all occupy the same place in the class system, the basic framework for organizing workers does not change depending on what kind of work they do. Regardless of craft or industry, the basic skills and tools and techniques of organizing are pretty much the same. We organize by talking with workers, asking questions, building relationships with them, getting them to build relationships with each other, having frank discussions about the problems they and we all face under capitalism, building solidarity as a group, and taking action to fight the boss. These basic elements of our approach to organizing, based on our commitment to the revolutionary principle of One Big Unionism, come from the fact that all workplace organizing uses basically the same set of skills and practices that any working person can learn and do.</p>
