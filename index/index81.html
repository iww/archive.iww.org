</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 02/13/2012 - 1:15am</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/01/24/anniversary-of-a-death-in-a-new-york-sweatshop/"><strong>By Daniel Gross - <em>Counterpunch</em>, January 24, 2012</strong></a></p>
<p>A year ago today, Juan Baten, a 22-year-old Guatemalan, was crushed to death while working in a Brooklyn tortilla factory.&nbsp; Mr. Baten was one of 35,000 workers in a little-known, but indispensable part of New York&rsquo;s food system: a sprawling industrial sector of food processing factories and distribution warehouses that supply the grocery stores and restaurants where New Yorkers purchase their food.&nbsp; A year later, justice has still not been done in Mr. Baten&rsquo;s case and New York&rsquo;s food supply chain continues to rely on the systematic exploitation of recent immigrant workers, many from Latin America and China.<br />
<br />
Mr. Baten started working at Tortilleria Chinantla when he was just sixteen years old. He was working to support his young family &ndash; his partner Rosario and their baby daughter Daisy Stephanie &ndash; and to send money back home to Guatemala where his father had recently died.&nbsp; Mr. Baten worked grueling, long shifts through the night for low pay, six days a week. On one such night a year ago, just hours after he called to check on his daughter, Mr. Baten was caught in the mixing machine in which he was brutally killed.<br />
<br />
After conducting an investigation of the death, OSHA, the federal workplace safety agency, concluded that had the employer obeyed its legal duty and placed a required guard on the mixing machine, Juan Baten would be alive with his family today. Instead, because of what OSHA called Chinantla&rsquo;s &ldquo;disregard for the law&rsquo;s requirements&rdquo; or &ldquo;indifference to worker safety and health,&rdquo; Daisy Stephanie is growing up without her father and Rosario lives with a deep wound in her heart.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 01/21/2012 - 2:41am</p>
<p>Washington, DC- Immigrant workers organizing for justice at a Brooklyn-based producer and distributor of kosher food products have taken a big step forward in their campaign and achieved a legal victory for workers around the country. Using discriminatory allegations about workers' immigration status, Flaum Appetizing has been resisting compliance with a 2009 trial decision that found the company illegally fired employees who came together seeking dignified working conditions. The National Labor Relations Board holding precludes Flaum from continuing to raise baseless immigration status defenses against at least eleven of the workers, and potentially as many as fifteen. By prohibiting employers from engaging in discriminatory 'fishing expeditions' against immigrants or perceived immigrants, the Board clarified important procedural safeguards in cases governed by the landmark anti-immigrant Supreme Court case, Hoffman Plastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Companies that discriminate and undermine labor rights drive down economic standards for every working person, native-born and immigrant alike,&quot; said Daniel Gross, the director of non-profit organization Brandworkers, which, along with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union is campaigning for justice at Flaum as part of the Focus on the Food Chain campaign. &quot;Worker organizing helps create the type of quality jobs that support a dynamic economy and healthy communities. The Labor Board's decision is an important step toward ensuring that Flaum and companies like it will not escape accountability through unfounded and discriminatory inquiries into immigration status.&quot;<br />
<br />
New York grocery stores and restaurants rely on an industrial corridor of food processing factories and distribution warehouses like Flaum that hold down wages and safety standards by exploiting recent immigrant workers. Wage theft, discrimination, and abuse is common in the sector and efforts for change are almost always met with determined and unlawful retaliation. Overcoming these challenges, the Flaum workers are waging a powerful campaign to bring the company into compliance with fundamental workplace protections. The workers have shared their story and persuaded over 120 of NYC's most prominent supermarket locations to discontinue selling Flaum products, including it's Sonny &amp; Joe's hummus, until the company comports with the rule of law. The global kosher cheese giant Tnuva refused to renew its distribution contract with Flaum after spirited worker campaigning and support from Jewish organizations including Uri L'Tzedek, the Orthodox social&nbsp; justice organization.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're glad Flaum didn't get away with avoiding its responsibilities under the law,&quot; said Maria Corona, one of the victorious workers and a Focus on the Food Chain member. &quot;There's power in coming together with your co-workers and we are well on our way to winning the justice we have been seeking.&quot;<br />
<br />
The NLRB's Office of the General Counsel is prosecuting the case against Flaum. The Flaum workers are represented by Eisner &amp; Mirer, a New York labor &amp; employment law firm.<br />
<br />
Focus on the Food Chain promotes sustainable jobs and a thriving local food industry in the City of New York. Through organizing, grassroots advocacy, and legal action, the campaign challenges and overcomes unlawful conditions in food processing and distribution warehouses. The Focus campaign is a collaboration of non-profit organization Brandworkers and the NYC Industrial Workers of the World labor union.</p>

<p><strong>By Andy Piascik</strong></p>
<p><em>This story will appear in the March 2012 issue of the </em><a href="../projects/IW/">Industrial Worker</a><em>. </em></p>
<p><img align="right" vspace="5" border="0" hspace="5" alt="" src="https://www.edb.utexas.edu/faculty/salinas/students/student_sites/Spring2005/Lawrence_Strike_of_1912/iwwx01.jpg" />One hundred years ago, in the dead of a Massachusetts winter, the great 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike&mdash;commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Bread and Roses&rdquo; strike&mdash;began. Accounts differ as to whether a woman striker actually held a sign that read &ldquo;We Want Bread and We Want Roses, Too.&rdquo; No matter. It&rsquo;s a wonderful phrase, as appropriate for the Lawrence strikers as for any group at any time: the notion that, in addition to the necessities for survival, people should have &ldquo;a sharing of life&rsquo;s glories,&rdquo; as James Oppenheim put it in his poem &ldquo;Bread and Roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though 100 years have passed, the Lawrence strike resonates as one of the most important in the history of the United States. Like many labor conflicts of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the strike was marked by obscene disparities in wealth and power, open collusion between the state and business owners, large scale violence against unarmed strikers, and great ingenuity and solidarity on the part of workers. In important ways, though, the strike was also unique. It was the first large-scale industrial strike, the overwhelming majority of the strikers were immigrants, most were women and children, and the strike was guided in large part by the revolutionary strategy and vision of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</p>
<p>Beyond its historical significance, elements of this massive textile strike may be instructive to building a radical working class movement today. It is noteworthy that the Occupy movement shares many philosophical and strategic characteristics with the Lawrence strike&mdash;direct action, the prominent role of women, the centrality of class, participatory decision-making, egalitarianism, an authentic belief in the Wobbly principle that We Are All Leaders&mdash;to name just a few. During the two months of the strike, the best parts of the revolutionary movement the IWW aspired to build were expressed. The Occupy movement carries that tradition forward, and as the attempt at a general strike in Oakland and solidarity events such as in New York for striking Teamsters indicate, many in Occupy understand that the working class is uniquely positioned to challenge corporate power. While we deepen our understanding of what that means and work to make it happen, there is much of value we can learn from what happened in Lawrence a century ago.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 01/05/2012 - 7:15pm</p>
<p>Cleaners at the Guildhall have been holding a sit in and stopping work since the 22nd of December because of mistreatment and intimidation. Early this morning [4th of January] management called the police, who came and intimidated and threatened the cleaners. The cleaners protested that they were holding a completely peaceful sit-in. They finally left due to police threats to drag them out physically.</p>
<p>The cleaners started organising in the summer, striking against unpaid wages. Since then they have been fighting for union recognition, better pay and an end to bad working conditions. After a new company, Sodexo, took over the cleaning contract, their union rep was suspended and they have been subject to all kinds of intimidation and abuse. The workers say there is one supervisor in particular who is abusive to them and there are currently various complaints by different cleaners against him, but Sodexho are refusing to do anything about his behaviour. Sodexho are trying to drive out the organised cleaners by continually changing their work areas, giving them the worst jobs, increasing their workload and, now, using intimidation and harassment.</p>

<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/anarchist.greenapron.jpg" alt="" />Union organizer with the IWW Starbucks Workers Union dispels the sentiment that 'being the better person' must entail living as a doormat.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of being told to be the bigger person. I get all the scrutiny. I should forgive the unforgivable. I should move on with my life, let it go, drop it, stop being confrontational, stop rocking the boat, stop holding grudges, and be the bigger person. When did &ldquo;being the bigger person&rdquo; mean just accepting being treated like shit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told not to create an &ldquo;us against them&rdquo; feeling between worker and employer. I did not create that. Employers created it and long before I was even born. It has always and will always be us, working ourselves to near death, against them, not lifting a finger to help but reaping all the spoils.</p>
<p>I fight this system of oppression because of all the love I have in me. It is because I&rsquo;m capable of great love that I am able to meet a coworker and know that I will fight for them regardless of who they are, the size of their families, where they are from, how they do their job, what languages they speak, and traditions they keep. Even if they can't fight for me, I will fight for them. It is because I think we&rsquo;re all truly worth something that I fight. Not everyone thinks like me. In fact, I think most people in American society are taught to never trust anyone. Everyone wants something from you, every boyfriend will cheat, every friend betray you, every parent leave you, every coworker steal credit for your work, every person asking directions will eventually ask for change, too. I don&rsquo;t see it that way. Every person that I meet I make a concerted effort to trust their words, listen to their stories, and give them the benefit of the doubt. Despite popular belief, I do this with bosses, too, to some extent. </p>
