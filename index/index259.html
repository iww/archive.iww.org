Protests were subsequently allowed.</p><p>Neither the unions representing the affected workers nor the SSP, which employes them, were informed of or permitted to attend the meeting of the Scottish Parliament committees where the decision was taken, nor were the IWW or NUJ notified that action against our members was being considered.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_410 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/british-isles-regional-administration/" rel="tag" title="British Isles Regional Administration">British Isles Regional Administration</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_37 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/general-legal-publ/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from General, Legal, Public Interest, and Financial Office Workers Industrial Union 650.

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/19/2005 - 12:25am</p>
<p align="center">HONOR AIRPORT WORKERS PICKET LINES! DON&rsquo;T CROSS FOR THE BOSS!</p><p align="center">SOLIDARITY WITH AIRCRAFT MECHANICS! NO MORE PATCO DEFEATS! </p><p align="center">AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL!</p><p><img width="230" height="206" border="0" align="right" src="../graphics/agitators/classic/jurisdictional_picket1.jpg" />The U.S. labor movement may be facing its most important test since the split in the AFL-CIO in July. Northwest Airlines has declared war on the Aircraft Mechanics and the Flight Attendants unions. The company has openly bragged that they're spending $100 million to hire and train 1,000 scab mechanics. Northwest crafted demands to force a strike: 50% cut in the workforce, 26% cut in pay, cut medical benefits by forcing workers to pay 20% of the premium and freeze the pensions for 15 years. Employers are stonewalling negotiations. The strike deadline is set for Friday August 19.</p><p>For workers it&rsquo;s an easy choice in a struggle between a greedy employer and a labor union. Yet, the leadership of neither wing of the split in the AFL-CIO has stepped forward to offer support for the airline workers. This is a shame! Have they learned nothing from the devastating defeat of the PATCO strike 24 years ago? In 1981, officers of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers' union were hauled off to jail in handcuffs at the urging of President Reagan. Unions at airports crossed the PATCO picket lines. It wasn't their jobs or union, so they thought, that was on the chopping block. The misleadership of the AFL-CIO did nothing to mobilize labor to defend picket lines. Instead they cynically called on the public not to fly. The tragic result: a union in a key transport industry was broken and all workers have suffered from that defeat since. Organized labor is down to a low of 12%. Corporate robber barons and their flunkey judges rip up negotiated pensions with impunity. Nowadays, strikes are seen in baseball, but rarely by workers organizing to defend their interests.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_31 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-500-transportation-and-communicatio-4/" rel="tag" title="

The indefinite time strike begun because of these reprisals on the side of the company. The sacked workers have also had a 8 day hunger strike while locked at the Seville cathedral.</p> <p>The offer of the company is to admit only 2 of the 4 sacked workers but under employment and wage suspension for 11 and 25 days, insisting on the other 2 dismissals. This is totally unacceptable to the workers and the CNT. The strike was convoked basically to demand the readmission for all the sacked workers, without counterweight.
