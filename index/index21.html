</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 11/09/2016 - 10:44pm</p>
<p><strong>By Eric D - New York City IWW, November 9, 2016</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/LeftOfLeft.jpg" alt="" width="320" align="right" height="478" />On a recent evening, members and friends of the New York City General Membership Branch gathered to hear a book discussion by Anatole Dolgoff. The talk was held at MayDay, a left movement space in Brooklyn. Dolgoff, a professor at the nearby Pratt Institute, was discussing his new book about his father Sam, <a href="https://www.akpress.org/left-of-the-left.html"><i>Left of the Left, My Memories of Sam Dolgoff </i></a>, recently published by AK Press. The talk was introduced by radical scholars Yesenia Barragan and Mark Bray.</p>
<p>Sam was born in 1902 in Belarus and came to New York City at an early age. With little formal education, Sam went to work as a painter, and quickly found himself immersed in local radical politics. A brief membership with the Socialist Party led him to realize that he was an anarchist. He soon joined the IWW in the 1920&rsquo;s and was a member until his death in 1990. Along the way, he developed friendships with many notable radicals, and had particularly close relationships with Carlo Tresca, the Italian anarchist, and Ben Fletcher, the legendary waterfront organizer.</p>
<p>Sam was a Wobbly activist and organizer for decades, involved in many campaigns and projects, speaking on street corners, meeting with workers who were organizing, confronting fascists in the 1930&rsquo;s, and doing the dangerous and unglamorous work of keeping radical ideas alive during the tough times of the McCarthy era. Self-educated in the movement along the way, Dolgoff made significant contributions to the anarchist literature over the years, including a book on Bakunin.</p>
<p>According to Anatole, Sam knew everyone in Left circles for decades. One memorable anecdote about his father told the story of when they went to see the movie <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Reds</i> together. Sam couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet during the film, as he maintained a running commentary on nearly every major character, who he had known personally.</p>
<p>The book is a fantastic tour through the life and times of a lifelong Wobbly and working class intellectual, as well as a touching personal memoir of growing up in a radical family. It&rsquo;s a great contribution to left history and we encourage all Wobblies to read it.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/26/2016 - 8:35pm</p>
<p><strong>By Arun Gupta - <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/19576/beyond_the_fight_for_15_the_worker_led_fast_food_campaign_at_burgerville/">In These Times</a>, October 25, 2016</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/working/bv_850_638.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="240" alt="" />Last year, at age 17, Eli Fishel moved out of her parents&rsquo; house in Vancouver, Washington, squeezing into a three-bedroom apartment with five other roommates. To pay her bills as she finished high school, Fishel landed a job at <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/about/">Burgerville</a>, a fast-food chain with 42 outlets and more than <a href="http://www.bcigroup.com/customer-stories/burgerville">1,500 employees</a> in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Founded in 1961, Burgerville has cultivated a loyal following by <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/about/">emphasizing</a> fresh, local food, combined with sustainable business practices like renewable energy and recycling. But Fishel quickly realized she wasn&rsquo;t part of Burgerville&rsquo;s commitment to &ldquo;regional vitality&rdquo; and &ldquo;future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After 16 months on the job, she earns just $9.85 an hour, barely above the Washington State minimum wage. Her hours and shifts fluctuate weekly, with only a few days&rsquo; notice, and every month she goes hungry because she runs out of money to buy food.</p>
<p>Speaking of the privately-owned Burgerville, Fishel says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re poor because they&rsquo;re rich, and they&rsquo;re rich because we&rsquo;re poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disgruntled Burgerville workers began covertly organizing in 2015. The <a href="http://www.burgervilleworkersunion.org/">Burgerville Workers Union</a> (BVWU) <a href="http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/apr/26/burgerville-workers-union-raises/">went public</a> on April 26 with a march of more than 100 people through Portland, Oregon, and the delivery of a letter to the corporate headquarters in Vancouver. BVWU demands include a $5-an-hour raise for all hourly workers, recognition of a workers organization, affordable, quality healthcare, a safe and healthy workplace, and fair and consistent scheduling with ample notice.</p>
<p>Some BVWU members call their effort &ldquo;Fight for $15, 2.0,&rdquo; playing off the name of the fast-food worker campaign launched in 2011 by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).</p>
<p>SEIU has won plaudits for making the plight of low-wage workers a national issue and igniting the movement for new laws boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour. But the campaign has not, thus far, included efforts to unionize individual workplaces.</p>
<p>Unlike Fight for $15, which Middlebury College sociology professor and labor expert Jamie McCallum describes as &ldquo;a fairly top-down campaign,&rdquo; BVWU is a worker-initiated and -led project backed by numerous labor organizations. The group of Burgerville workers who came up with the idea includes members of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a militant union with West Coast roots that date back to the early 1900s. The campaign has the backing of the Portland chapter of IWW and the support SEIU Local 49, the Portland Association of Teachers, and Jobs with Justice.</p>
<p>This scrappy approach enabled BVWU to leapfrog Fight for $15 by declaring a union from the start. While BVWU has not yet formally petitioned for recognition and Burgerville has not chosen to voluntarily negotiate with it, the union has established worker committees in five stores, is developing units in a similar number of shops and counts scores of workers as members.</p>
<p>BVWU is full of lessons in how organizing works. One member likens the campaign to &ldquo;low-level guerrilla warfare&rdquo; with workers maneuvering to increase their ranks, build power on the shop floor, expand the terrain from shop to shop, while skirmishing with managers over the work process, and suffering casualties as some members have quit or say they were pushed out of their jobs at Burgerville. In the workplace, the strategy is to develop leaders, form committees for each store, and nurture trust and respect between workers. Outside, BVWU uses direct action to empower workers and bring suppliers into the conversation. The union also works to build community support by mobilizing social-justice groups, clergy, and organized labor to win over the public and pressure the company.</p>
<p>McCallum says that BVWU an example of social movement unionism. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about organizing as a class against another class,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to win demands not just against a single boss or to change a law, but to engage in class struggle.&rdquo;</p>

<a href="../content/announcement-nationally-coordinated-prisoner-workstoppage-sept-9-2016/" rel="bookmark">Announcement of Nationally Coordinated Prisoner Workstoppage for Sept 9, 2016</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 09/09/2016 - 11:07am</p>
<p><em>This following is a statement from the&nbsp;<a title="IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee" href="https://iwoc.noblogs.org/" rel="home">IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee</a>.</em></p>
<p>Prisoners from across the United States have just released this call to action for a nationally coordinated prisoner workstoppage against prison slavery to take place on September 9th, 2016.</p>
<p>This is a Call to Action Against Slavery in America</p>
<p>In one voice, rising from the cells of long term solitary confinement, echoed in the dormitories and cell blocks from Virginia to Oregon, we prisoners across the United States vow to finally end slavery in 2016.</p>
<p>On September 9th of 1971 prisoners took over and shut down Attica, New York State&rsquo;s most notorious prison. On September 9th of 2016, we will begin an action to shut down prisons all across this country. We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves.</p>
<p>In the 1970s the US prison system was crumbling. In Walpole, San Quentin, Soledad, Angola and many other prisons, people were standing up, fighting and taking ownership of their lives and bodies back from the plantation prisons. For the last six years we have remembered and renewed that struggle. In the interim, the prisoner population has ballooned and technologies of control and confinement have developed into the most sophisticated and repressive in world history. The prisons have become more dependent on slavery and torture to maintain their stability.</p>
<p>Prisoners are forced to work for little or no pay. That is slavery. The 13th amendment to the US constitution maintains a legal exception for continued slavery in US prisons. It states &ldquo;neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.&rdquo; Overseers watch over our every move, and if we do not perform our appointed tasks to their liking, we are punished. They may have replaced the whip with pepper spray, but many of the other torments remain: isolation, restraint positions, stripping off our clothes and investigating our bodies as though we are animals.</p>
<p>Slavery is alive and well in the prison system, but by the end of this year, it won&rsquo;t be anymore. This is a call to end slavery in America. This call goes directly to the slaves themselves. We are not making demands or requests of our captors, we are calling ourselves to action. To every prisoner in every state and federal institution across this land, we call on you to stop being a slave, to let the crops rot in the plantation fields, to go on strike and cease reproducing the institutions of your confinement.</p>
<p>This is a call for a nation-wide prisoner work stoppage to end prison slavery, starting on September 9th, 2016. They cannot run these facilities without us.</p>
<p>Non-violent protests, work stoppages, hunger strikes and other refusals to participate in prison routines and needs have increased in recent years. The 2010 Georgia prison strike, the massive rolling California hunger strikes, the Free Alabama Movement&rsquo;s 2014 work stoppage, have gathered the most attention, but they are far from the only demonstrations of prisoner power. Large, sometimes effective hunger strikes have broken out at Ohio State Penitentiary, at Menard Correctional in Illinois, at Red Onion in Virginia as well as many other prisons. The burgeoning resistance movement is diverse and interconnected, including immigrant detention centers, women&rsquo;s prisons and juvenile facilities. Last fall, women prisoners at Yuba County Jail in California joined a hunger strike initiated by women held in immigrant detention centers in California, Colorado and Texas.</p>
<p>Prisoners all across the country regularly engage in myriad demonstrations of power on the inside. They have most often done so with convict solidarity, building coalitions across race lines and gang lines to confront the common oppressor.</p>
<p>Forty-five years after Attica, the waves of change are returning to America&rsquo;s prisons. This September we hope to coordinate and generalize these protests, to build them into a single tidal shift that the American prison system cannot ignore or withstand. We hope to end prison slavery by making it impossible, by refusing to be slaves any longer.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we need support from people on the outside. A prison is an easy-lockdown environment, a place of control and confinement where repression is built into every stone wall and chain link, every gesture and routine. When we stand up to these authorities, they come down on us, and the only protection we have is solidarity from the outside. Mass incarceration, whether in private or state-run facilities is a scheme where slave catchers patrol our neighborhoods and monitor our lives. It requires mass criminalization. Our tribulations on the inside are a tool used to control our families and communities on the outside. Certain Americans live every day under not only the threat of extra-judicial execution&mdash;as protests surrounding the deaths of Mike Brown, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and so many others have drawn long overdue attention to&mdash;but also under the threat of capture, of being thrown into these plantations, shackled and forced to work.</p>
<p>Our protest against prison slavery is a protest against the school to prison pipeline, a protest against police terror, a protest against post-release controls. When we abolish slavery, they&rsquo;ll lose much of their incentive to lock up our children, they&rsquo;ll stop building traps to pull back those who they&rsquo;ve released. When we remove the economic motive and grease of our forced labor from the US prison system, the entire structure of courts and police, of control and slave-catching must shift to accommodate us as humans, rather than slaves.</p>
<p>Prison impacts everyone, when we stand up and refuse on September 9th, 2016, we need to know our friends, families and allies on the outside will have our backs. This spring and summer will be seasons of organizing, of spreading the word, building the networks of solidarity and showing that we&rsquo;re serious and what we&rsquo;re capable of.</p>
<p>Step up, stand up, and join us.<br />
Against prison slavery.<br />
For liberation of all.</p>

<p><strong>By the elected delegates to the 2016 IWW Convention - </strong><a target="_blank" href="../"><strong>Industrial Workers of the World</strong></a><strong>, September 3, 2016</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" align="right" height="180" src="http://ecology.iww.org/images/IWWNoDapl1.JPG" alt="" />The international convention of the Industrial Workers of the World just unanimously voted in favor of an &ldquo;Emergency Resolution&rdquo; in solidarity with the resistance against the Dakota Access Pipeline!</p>
<p>In the introduction the Chair of the convention acknowledged that the convention is being held on Ohlone land. We also strongly encouraged workers to organize solidarity actions, travel to Standing Rock, and materially support the struggle.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World stands in solidarity with the resistance against the Dakota Access Pipeline. We call on the labor movement and working class to take a stand against environmental racism and join the fight for a just transition as our collective future is at stake. We recognize that the capitalist system that oppresses the working class has always oppressed indigenous people of the World.</p>
<p>Therefore we feel that settlers and indigenous workers should unite to take direct action against colonial industrial capitalism and do everything in our power to restore justice to indigenous people and Mother Earth. An injury to one is an injury to all! <strong>#nodapl #sacredstonespiritcamp #redwarriorcamp #waterislife</strong></p>

<p><b>September 4, 2016</b></p>
<p><b>Editor's Note:</b> <i>This appeal has been updated to address the attack on the demonstrators were attacked by private security led dogs.</i></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" height="180" src="http://ecology.iww.org/images/IWWNoDapl1.JPG" width="320" />Fellow Workers:</p>
<p>If you've not read or seen the news about the <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline</strong>, and the vast and growing opposition to it (#NoDAPL) by now, you've not been paying attention.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/09/02/among-the-pipeline-fighters-in-central-iowa/" target="_blank">One Account</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beneath the cover of the endless presidential election season, which in Iowa started a year and a half ago, the Texas-based company Dakota Access LLC (a division of the corporation Energy Transfer Partners [ETP]) has moved methodically ahead with its plan to build this ugly, winding, and ecocidal tube of death. The $4 billion, 1134-mile project would carry 540,000 barrels of largely fracked crude oil from North Dakota’s “Bakken oil patch” daily on a diagonal course through South Dakota, a Sioux Indian burial ground,18 Iowa counties, and a Native American reservation to Patoka, Illinois. It will link with another pipeline that will transport the black gold to terminals and refineries along the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, several thousand indigenous tribal members (supported by over 160 tribes), land owners, environmentalists, climate justice activists, and supporters of #BlackLivesMatter have gathered together into two camps in rural North Dakota to organize nonviolent resistance to this massive project which will parallel and match the length of the infamous (but rejected by Presidential order) Keystone XL pipeline.&nbsp; Several others have been protesting all along the pipeline's route over the past couple of weeks. These 1000s strong intrepid folks are supported nationally and internationally by 100,000s.</p>
<p>The leaders in this effort have done all they can working "within the system" to oppose this project <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/09/02/among-the-pipeline-fighters-in-central-iowa/" target="_blank">to no avail</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti-pipeline activists have been playing by all the official local, state, and federal rules. They’ve gone through the established channels of law and procedure. They’ve worked the legal and regulatory machinery to the point of exhaustion. They’ve gone through all available avenues of reason and petition. They’ve written and delivered carefully worded petitions and given polite, fact-filled testimony to all the relevant public bodies. They’ve appealed to the IUB. They’ve appealed to the Army Corps of Engineers and to numerous other federal agencies and offices including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Advisory on Historic Preservation, and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. They’ve sued in court, defending farmers’ traditional American-as-apple-pie private property rights...And it’s all been for naught because the state is stuck in the deep pockets of Big Carbon. Last week a long-awaited district court ruling in Des Moines gave DA, ETP, Enbridge, and Marathon and their big financial backers what they wanted. DA is free to complete construction on fifteen parcels where the farm owners had challenged the state’s right to enforce eminent domain on behalf of the Bakken snake.</p>

<p>This project would represent a disaster for the world's climate. Already humanity is experiencing a climate emergency--as the increase in the Earth's average overall surface temperature has surpassed 1°C--brought on by fossil fuel capitalism. Every sensible scientific peer reviewed study dictates that in order to avoid the destruction of the ability of humanity (and much else living) to survive on our planet, the global increase must reach no higher than 2°C, <em>at most</em> (and most agree that an increase beyond 1.5°C would be bad enough). In order to do this, at <em>least</em> 80% of the known fossil fuel "reserves" must remain in the ground. This pipeline would make that prospect increasingly difficult, because it is designed to facilitate the continuing extraction of the Bakken Shale in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Worse than that, this pipeline represents the further colonization of indigenous lands, particularly that which lie adjacent to or solidly within the path of this project.</p>
<p>None of this is necessary. Studies show that all of the world's energy needs can be met by a combination of conservation, 100% renewable energy generation--which is entirely feasible using existing technology, and a reordering of the world's economic systems to facilitate production for need, not profit. The 100,000s of people who oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline understand this.</p>
<p>In spite of this massive opposition however, one group, in particular, has remained disturbingly silent, and that's labor unions.</p>
