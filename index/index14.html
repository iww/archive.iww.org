<p>This week, Bursts spoke with Ben Turk about the August 19th call out for solidarity with prisoners. The Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, a project of the Industrial Workers of the World (or IWW) syndicalist labor union is one body organizing the inside and outside actions, and Ben is a member. Ben&rsquo;s also affiliated with <a href="http://www.lucasvilleamnesty.org/" target="_blank">Lucasville Amnesty</a></p>
<p>Last year was a huge time for radical organizing around the U.S. Prisoners from around the country participated in the September 9th national prisoner strike, the first of it&rsquo;s size and scope that we&rsquo;ve seen. This event mobilized individual prisoners and also sprang from groups like the <a href="http://freealabamamovement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Alabama Movement</a> and it&rsquo;s sister pushes in other carceral states, Anarchist Black Cross chapters, the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, or IWOC, of the Industrial Workers of the World labor union and also by just lots of unaffiliated prisoners.</p>
<p>Now, we have what could be called a hard Law and Disorder administration in the White House talking about increasing funding and support for cops, further militarizing the border and terrorizing residents, reviving the 1980&rsquo;s style war on drugs and other repressive actions. In this context, it feels necessary for those who have a different vision of the world to push back and keep pushing as we were under Obama, under Bush &amp; before.</p>
<p>This August 19th there is a call for another prisoner-led show of resistance supported by folks on the outside as well.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 06/27/2017 - 5:43pm</p>
<p><strong>By Raleigh-Durham IWOC - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/raleigh-durham-nc-iwoc-friends-picket-nc-department-public-safety/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, June 20, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/FancyIWWConstPosterPT.jpg" align="right" alt="" />Members and supporters of the Raleigh-Durham General Membership Branch (GMB) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) held a picket outside the headquarters of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, 831 W. Morgan Street, in Raleigh, at 12 noon on Friday, June 23rd in solidarity with members and comrades of their union incarcerated in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;soft&rdquo; picket, which did not blockade the street, sidewalk, or the entrance to NCDPS, but which forced DPS workers to walk through the line on their lunch break, was organized by the Raleigh-Durham GMB&rsquo;s local of the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee in response to repression faced by IWW/IWOC members on the inside who are working to form a union, to organize against prison slavery, and make other inside struggles known on the outside.</p>
<p>Also present at the action were organizers for the Millions for Prisoners March on August 19th in Washington DC. Organizers shared the reasoning behind the march and expressed the need for everyone invested in the abolition of prison slavery to either join them in Washington or organize a local march in their hometown. <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/final-straw-august-19th-day-action-millions-for-prisoners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IWOC fully supports the Millions for Prisoners March</a> and will be there in force.</p>
<p>The forms of repression faced by the fellow workers in the NC prison system are diverse, but they all stem directly from decisions made by those who work in the Department of Public Safety, which supervises NC Prisons. Stanley Corbett Jr., for example, writes:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">These people (officers Synder, Falliner, &amp; Walker, including Sgt. Lancaster) have stopped all of my mail from my family, friends, &amp; associates. It&rsquo;s another form of retaliation, in which their striving to keep me from communicating with society, due to the fact that I&rsquo;m letting the public know what&rsquo;s going on in here. I need you &amp; anyone else that can help me to call this facility, and speak to Mr. Marshall about getting me transferred or swapped.&rdquo; Allen Littlejohn III writes &ldquo;They have pushed my release date back for no reason. I was on 9-29-17 but now they have pushed my release date back to 1-11-18 for no reason. I&rsquo;ve not received a infraction so what is the reason behind these games.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the lead-up to the picket, the Raleigh-Durham IWOC shared some letters written by Fellow Workers currently locked inside the North Carolina prison system. <a href="https://raleighdurhamiwoc.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Those letters can be found here.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Members of the IWW have created the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, or IWOC, which functions as a liaison for prisoners to organize each other, unionize, and build solid bridges between prisoners on the inside and fellow workers on the outside. IWOC has been actively reaching out to prisoners while at the same time prisoners have been reaching out to the IWW for representation and assistance in building a prisoners union. IWOC has taken up the cause and is helping prisoners in every facility organize and build a union branch for themselves, which will together form a powerful IWW Industrial Union.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 06/26/2017 - 7:33pm</p>
<p><strong>By staff - <a href="https://newsyndicalist.org/2017/06/20/wobblies-of-the-world-interview/" target="_blank"><em>New Syndicalist</em></a>, June 20, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../sites/default/files/images/9780745399591.jpg" width="320" height="491" align="right" alt="" />New Syndicalist Blog spoke to Peter Cole, David Struthers and Kenyon Zimmer about their upcoming volume, &lsquo;Wobblies of the World: A Global History of the IWW&rsquo; &ndash; available for preorder from <a href="http://www.plutobooks.com/display.asp?K=9780745399591&amp;">Pluto Press</a>. We asked them what their history revealed about the organising approaches of the IWW in the past, what lessons can be learned for the future and how the One Big Union has adapted to a changing world.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. What motivated you to publish a global history of the IWW at this time?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Although the world seems insane right now, our book was conceived of some years back&mdash;but shit was crazy then, too. Just as the rise of the global New Left in the 1960s sparked interest in the history of the Wobblies so have recent events. Anti-globalization, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, and other recent social movements were impressive but lacked a strong union presence. However, these push-backs against neoliberalism revealed examples of anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist tactics and ideals, a la the IWW of old. We believe that history must be &ldquo;useable,&rdquo; meaning people should look to Wobbly history for examples of successful struggles that are applicable to the present-day. Transformations within history as an academic discipline also made this book possible, as scholars have increasingly turned to global and transnational approaches to topics previously studies within neat national compartments, as thought people, goods, and ideas have not always traversed (and transgressed) borders.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did your contributors reveal any significant variations in the IWW over place or time?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, for the IWW to grow in the soil of many lands, it had to adapt to local conditions. In Australia, the IWW worked with the mainstream unions&mdash;despite ideological differences&mdash;in opposing World War I, which resulted in surprising solidarity from those unions when the IWW suffered fierce government repression. In Ireland, one-time Wobblies led a nationalist revolution. What Wobblies did in Tampico, Mexico could be quite different than what they did in Malm&ouml;, Sweden. Perhaps equally fascinating are the commonalties. For one, the IWW did not shed its bedrock opposition to racism and xenophobia, no matter the mainstream customs of whichever society in which it organised. The IWW was the first white-majority union or organisation to attempt lining up Maori in New Zealand and Xhosa in South Africa. The IWW rejected anti-Asian sentiment in California and embraced Finns across northern Ontario. Some things never change.</p>

This speech, originally delivered at the 75th Anniversary of the 1934 San Francisco General Strike at the Marine Firemen&rsquo;s Hall in San Francisco, was adapted for the rally preceding the May Day march on May 1, 2017.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, when he was a North Beach resident, poet Allen Ginsberg shipped out various times with the merchant marines from the Embarcadero. Earlier, the proximity of the waterfront to the vibrant intellectual life of the bohemians and political radicals of North Beach made San Francisco the most radical port city in the U.S. But Ginsberg lived in North Beach during the height of the Cold War, so perhaps it should be expected that his poem &ldquo;America&rdquo; has the line:</p>
<div class="bb-quote"><b>Allen Ginsberg wrote:</b><br />

<p>Poet Kenneth Rexroth, who was close to the circle of anarchists and anti-World War II pacifists who founded KPFA in 1949, and earlier had been a soapboxer and wrote for the <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfront Worker</span>, said this about the pre-World War II period:</p>
<div class="bb-quote"><b>Kenneth Rexroth wrote:</b><br />

The interesting thing is that most of them became practical labor organizers, rather than Bohemians sitting around Union Square arguing about proletarian literature . . . You see, all of us were very actively involved and this makes all the difference in the world. Another thing, very few of these people were orthodox Commies because the basic tradition on the West Coast was IWW.</blockquote></div>
<p>From the California Gold Rush onwards, a worker on the West Coast could easily go out and get a job in the woods or at sea or in the fields.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 06/18/2017 - 4:42pm</p>
<p><strong>By anonymous - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/utica-ny-iww-community-groups-mobilize-halt-deportation/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, June 8, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/j20.preview.jpg" align="right" alt="" />A father, soccer coach, and Utica resident Ricky Morgan was separated from his family on June 5th during a routine check-in with ICE and will now be deported to Jamaica. Family members, community members and local activists are struggling to come to terms with this sudden, grim reality.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, a broad coalition of organizations, including ICE-Free Capital District, the labor union Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Troy Sanctuary Movement and the Unitarian Universalist Society of Saratoga Springs have come to Ricky&rsquo;s aid and accompanied him for monthly check-ins with ICE. Ricky was inspired by a previous rally activists held for a mother and immigrant from Hudson, NY who was facing deportation. He hoped that similar support from the community would help him in the future. For a while, Ricky was only checking in with ICE once a year until he was told after the election of Trump that he became a priority for deportation and had to check in with ICE monthly.</p>
<p>Ricky moved to the US in the 1990s on a work visa and is still permitted to work in the US. He was targeted in the past by ICE during the Obama administration and was separated from his family by ICE for six months while he was kept in Batavia&rsquo;s ICE Detention Center, one of countless jails in the US that exist to house immigrants. He will now be sent back to Batavia before his deportation.</p>
<p>Joe Paparone, an organizer with ICE-Free Capital District stated: &ldquo;We need to start telling the truth. Immigration enforcement has nothing to do with criminality, and it&rsquo;s regular people like Ricky &ndash; people with families, communities, workplaces, neighbors, that are having their lives torn apart, for no reason other than the racist scapegoating of a pathological liar. Those of us who care about our communities are going to keep fighting this racist deportation regime, and keep standing up for vulnerable members of our communities.&rdquo;</p>
