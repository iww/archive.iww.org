<p><img src="../graphics/IU660/sbux/Starbucks1a.jpg" align="right" border="1" />New York, NY- Industrial Workers of the World members and supporters entered Starbucks cafes today in cities across the United States, Canada, and the British Isles to inform workers about their right to form a union. The union members highlighted gains in wages, security of hours, and respect on the job won by baristas who have already joined the IWW. The Day of Action commemorates the second anniversary of the founding of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union on May 17, 2004. Since 2004, baristas have improved their life at work through direct action on the job and in the community despite an illegal anti-union campaign waged by Starbucks and its Chairman Howard Schultz.</p> <p>&ldquo;Our message for our co-workers is simple: the IWW Starbucks Workers Union is here to help,&rdquo; said Suley Ayala, a Starbucks barista and IWW member in New York City. &ldquo;Employees don't have to go through the indignities of working at Starbucks alone anymore-together we'll continue our march toward a living wage, guaranteed work hours, and most importantly, respect.&rdquo;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

Like most mornings, on Monday May 1, Eliezer Maca arrived at 5:30 a.m. at the warehouse, where he spends six days a week loading trucks ferrying supplies to New York&rsquo;s Chinese restaurant industry. </p><p>Today, however, Maca was not here to work.</p> <p>Having been fired on April 29 by the owner, he was flanked by a handful of youthful, scarletemblazoned members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and a dozen coworkers, forming an enthusiastic picket line. It was the fifth such picket at the company in as many weeks, as workers took to heart the direct action and worker-lead strikes characteristic of the IWW.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.

Years of bad hours, poor pay, a hostile work environment and the demoralizing treatment from theater management has led the Cinema workers of Berkeley, CA, to push for a union; for the One Big Union of the Industrial Workers of the World.</p> <p>At 4pm on May 12, 2006, approximately 80 Wobblies and supporters gathered in what some hailed as one of the largest IWW gatherings in recent Bay Area history, next to the May Day contingent earlier this month. Theater workers, union organizers and locals from the community attended the rally to demonstrate their solidarity for the union effort, carrying signs that read &ldquo;An injury to one is an injury to all&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Union Now&rdquo;. A drum team kept the crowd enthused, as they sang union songs and recited pro-worker chants to the public. Some Cinema employees were still on the clock, but were very much committed to participate in the rally while on their breaks, wearing their IWW pins and showing support for the union. Shattuck Cinema organizer, Harjit Gill, says &ldquo;I think what we see here today is a great success. There has been the participation of IWW members from the past and the present, and those who haven&rsquo;t been recently active. Ultimately, we&rsquo;re very excited about this campaign.&rdquo; </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.

Denver received at least 75,000 people, or one-sixth of the city&rsquo;s population, in a rally outside the state capitol.
