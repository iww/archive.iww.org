</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/13/2016 - 4:32pm</p>
<p><strong>By staff</strong><strong> - <a href="http://www.iww570.org/2016/12/northeast-pennsylvania-iww-call-for.html" target="_blank">NEPA&nbsp;IWW</a>, December 1, 2016</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/english_0.jpg" width="320" height="495" align="right" alt="" />The Northeast Pennsylvania Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) stands in strong opposition to the reactionary and authoritarian forces that are on the rise in many parts of the world including the United States. These reactionaries will take control of the US government on January 20th with the inauguration of Donald Trump. These forces seek to divide the working class and turn worker against worker for the benefit of those that have the most wealth and power.&nbsp; This is not new. We have seen this over and over again throughout history &ndash; from Franco&rsquo;s Spain, Nazi Germany and the era of Thatcher and Reagan. Each of these regimes viciously attacked labor, immigrants and all others that opposed them.&nbsp; We vow to fight this latest upsurge of reactionary forces together as a united working class seeking our liberation.&nbsp; We refuse to see our fellow workers as enemies regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, immigration status or nationality. We believe in the slogan: an injury to one is an injury to all. </p>
<p>On January 20th 2017 Donald Trump and his reactionary cabal will take office.&nbsp; We must resist this dangerous regime. We have seen their values. They rose to power on a platform of hate and division. They will continue this as they take hold of the U.S. government. If history is any guide, we know that once they are fully in power, they will attack organized labor and every perceived enemy very soon after. They know that we, the workers that run society, are one of the few obstacles to their agenda. We need to take this opportunity to show our unity and our strength.</p>
<p>We call for mass action across the nation and the world on January 20th to resist these dangerous forces. We will organize resistance in our workplaces, our communities and in the streets. We call on all people to do the same. Take action to resist this rising tide of reactionary authoritarianism. Organize a walkout at your school or workplace. Call in sick. Take to the streets. Together, we will place our bodies upon the gears of the machine of hate and force it to a stop. As the Trump regime consolidates power and fills all the seats of the state with yes-men and cronies, the power of popular resistance is the only power we have left.&nbsp; The IWW has been doing this for more than110 years and we will continue to fight for the liberation of the working class. This is a struggle for the type of world we want to live in - a struggle for humanity against barbarism. </p>
<p>If we do not act now, it will be too late.&nbsp; If we let them take the reins of the state without any resistance they will think that they have won - that they have a mandate. They do not. We are the majority. We hold the greater power of collective resistance and collective solidarity.&nbsp; We are humanity. We will win! </p>
<p>In Scranton we will be gathering at 12:00 noon for a rally and march in Courthouse Square. Join us in this show of solidarity.</p>

<p><strong>Statement on Opposing All Oppression from the <a href="https://twincitiesgdc.org/antifascism/" target="_blank">Twin Cities GDC Local 14</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="../sites/default/files/images/Didnottread.jpg" width="400" height="225" align="right" alt="" />1. ANY SUCCESSFUL WORKER REVOLUTION WILL REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM DIVERSE MEMBERS OF THE WORKING CLASS, CURRENTLY DIVIDED BY MANY OPPRESSIONS.</strong></p>
<p>We fight against capitalism. We do so because capitalism is organized theft based on hierarchy. We unionize because fighting this authoritarian theft can be done most successfully in the workplace, at the point of production. In unionizing we face many challenges, from creating strategies and tactics to accomplish our goals, as well as maintaining morale, fighting spirit, and solidarity with each other.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult challenges the working class faces is that of oppressive social divisions. We may be of a single class, but we are not the same as a result. In addition to experiencing the oppressions of our class, we have differing experiences of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism and Islamphobia, along with other types of oppressions. Some of us experience privilege on the basis of our race, sex, gender, or religion, while others among us experience oppression on precisely the same grounds.</p>
<p>The ruling classes know this, of course. It is one of their favorite strategies for destroying organized workers: divide and conquer. Many of these oppressions exist in starkest relief in America&rsquo;s massive prison-industrial system, where wardens encourage and enforce racial segregation and violence among prisoners, precisely as a system of maintaining control. These forms of control through oppression are not limited to prisons, of course. We see and experience them in our daily lives, and in our workplaces as well.</p>
<p>To maintain solidarity with all workers requires that we maintain explicit solidarity with workers on the diverse grounds of their oppression. Our revolution cannot maintain a merely minimal, workerist, program which concentrates on the oppression of labor and leaves other problems solely to those workers who face them. Given the still relatively homogenous makeup of the Industrial Workers of the World, to do so sends a clear message to the working class experiencing such oppressions that the class struggle and their struggles against racism, gendered, or religious oppression are separate issues. If you were already struggling to keep the basics of your life together in the face of constant attacks on your person, would you be interested in taking on another massive but unconnected struggle in your workplace? By pointing out the ways in which struggles against all oppression support and further our collective freedom from class and other oppressions, we gain strength as a union.</p>
<p>Neither have we proceeded, historically, with a minimal program of workplace organization that leaves other oppressions unchallenged. The Industrial Workers of the World were founded in 1905 in part precisely to overcome the divisions of race, sex, religion, language, nationality, etc., among the working class. Militantly in favor of the organization of the entire working class, Wobblies quickly turned toward the power of young women in garment factories, racially-mixed work-gangs on the waterfronts, and nationally diverse immigrant groups. The IWW took on the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations that attempted to divide the class on the grounds of race. More recently, some IWW branches have begun to successfully undermine the divisions of oppressions based on gendered identities in ways that seem truly revolutionary.</p>

<p><strong>By Edinburgh Wobbly - <a target="_blank" href="https://iwwscotland.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/anti-racist-message-from-clydeside-iww-st-andrews-day-march-2016/">IWW Scotland</a>, November 25, 2016</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/iww-no-borders_0_0.jpg" align="right" alt="" />Now more than ever we need organising that is:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong>anti-racist</strong></li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong>anti-fascist</strong></li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><strong> internationalist.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory in the US elections, following the recent Brexit vote, creates a whole new political climate in the West.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, working class people have suffered a massive attack with the loss of traditional industries, in favour of low-paid service jobs, and the destruction of the labour movement.&nbsp; The neoliberal model that was created was based on growth through the financial sector and it led to the 2008 economic crisis.</p>
<p>When the UK government bailed out the banks it forced us to shoulder the cost through austerity, cutting vital services and targetting the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The left responded to post-crisis austerity first through mass protest around the world, and then the rise of several populist movements seeking parliamentary power.&nbsp; One by one, they have been defeated or have so far been unable to provide any real challenge.</p>
<p>And now things are about to get worse.</p>
<p>There are many uncertainties &ndash; what will Brexit mean? how will Trump govern?&nbsp; What we can expect in the UK is that austerity will go on, even if the aim is no longer to cut the deficit, and real wages &nbsp;will continue to decline.</p>
<p>Both Brexit and Trump&rsquo;s presidency are a victory for the far right.&nbsp; Immigration to the UK will be curbed and border controls will become even more cruel.&nbsp; Racism against ethnic minorities will be reinforced by the tabloid media as the nationalist dream fails to appear.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that <strong>migrants don&rsquo;t lower wages &ndash; bosses do</strong>.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 11/22/2016 - 3:41pm</p>
<p><b>Official Statement - IWW General Executive Board, November 22, 2016</b></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/three_fist.jpg" alt="" align="right" />These are difficult times for the working class, times of struggle and hardship. The employing class controls more of the world&rsquo;s wealth and power than ever before, and the divide between working people and our oppressors grows wider by the day.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that this is nothing new. The ruling class has been waging a war against the working class since the birth of capitalism. We, the workers of the world, continue to be exploited and abused, the value of our labor always falling into the boss&rsquo; pockets. While they rake in unprecedented profits, the employing class continues to damage our planet through the unsustainable and irresponsible extraction of natural resources. These vultures tell you that your disappointments, your failures, and your hardships are the fault of other working class people. People of different races, genders, nationalities, and religions. &ldquo;Blame immigrants,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Blame blacks and Latinos,&rdquo; they say. As we fight amongst ourselves, the ruling class celebrates in their gilded halls, making toasts to the disunity of the working class.</p>
<p>Many people in the working class sought out hope in the electoral system this year, confident that reason and compassion would hold the day. Many other people in the working class were motivated by bigotry. The electoral system is designed to disenfranchise all working people, to take their hopes and desires as mere suggestions rather than as concrete demands. Unions, which are supposed to fight for all working people, organized people to put their faith in fighting bigotry at the ballot box - and now they say they are &ldquo;ready to work with&rdquo; the representatives of bigotry and division.You are no doubt feeling disillusioned, fearful, and angry, and are ready to consider different ways of fighting back against our oppressors.</p>
<p>We, the Industrial Workers of the World, invite you to work with us in building a new kind of labor movement, one that refuses to play by the rules of the employing class. An approach where we no longer allow them to divide us along artificial lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, or religion. From housewives to factory workers to prisoners to office workers, we are all the working class, and it is our labor that creates all wealth. We can challenge the ruling class if we unite with each other, but that unity must start with defending the most oppressed and vulnerable groups among us first, for &ldquo;an injury to one is an injury to all.&rdquo; It is clear that there is a strong current of bigotry within the US working class, and we pledge to confront that head on in our organizing. We believe we can win workers away from bigotry if we show that we have a plan to win a better world. We must work towards the creation of a new world in the shell of the old, and the only way to do that is through organizing in our workplaces and in our communities.</p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World have been organizing working people for over 110 years, and our future as a revolutionary union is bright. Our approach is one of direct action. Instead of relying on elected officials and other intermediaries, we take the fight directly to our oppressors. We have been trailblazers in the modern labor movement, organizing fast food workers in Oregon, package handlers in Minnesota, entertainers and restaurant workers in New York, and prison laborers throughout the country, to name just a few. Our members have been at the forefront of resistance to police violence and the Dakota access pipeline. We have been working tirelessly to build a genuine and truly representative working class organization that can provide strength to working people, and we need your help.</p>
<p>If you have questions about exactly who we are and what we do, let's talk. If you're ready to organize and resist, join us and we will welcome you as fellow workers and fellow members of the working class. It is time to organize, it is time to fight back. Let's make white supremacists, fascists, and other hate mongers fear our power. Our struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but we will win. Sign up for the One Big Union today, and let&rsquo;s organize together in our workplaces and communities. Nothing is too good for the working class, and we want all the good things life has to offer.</p>
