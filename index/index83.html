</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/20/2011 - 3:27pm</p>
<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/GSDrookEngsm.preview.jpg" alt="" />Since the February uprising in Wisconsin, which began with a three-week occupation of the Capitol in Madison, the building has been home to a variety of demonstrations and political actions.&nbsp; What perhaps stands out the most is the Solidarity Sing-along, which draws upwards of 100 participants and has been going on for more than 40 weeks.&nbsp; The singers gather in the rotunda each weekday at noon to sing songs that include both traditional labor and protest songs and some new songs penned in the months since Governor Scott Walker first introduced his plans to bust the public employee unions and impose devastating austerity measures on the working class of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In recent months police have begun arresting and ticketing people for trivial &quot;violations&quot;, such as wearing hats or sunglasses in the Senate and Assembly galleries, holding signs, or exercising their right (protected by the Wisconsin constitution) to record legislative sessions.&nbsp; These restrictions have apparently been a lead-up to the real crackdown.&nbsp; Just last week, the Walker administration announced a new policy that will severely curtail the free speech rights exercised by the Solidarity Sing-along and other groups who use the Capitol building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules require groups of four or more people to apply for a permit from the DOA at least 72 hours in advance &ldquo;for all activity and displays in state buildings&rdquo;.&nbsp; Groups can be charged $50 per hour per police officer if law enforcement is determined to be necessary.&nbsp; Payment for law enforcement could be required in advance as part of the permit process and protesters could face additional charges for liability insurance.&nbsp; The rules are vague and arbitrary, and so far the administration has refused to clarify them or answer questions from citizens about how they will be enforced, leaving room for abuse by police and DOA officials.</p>
<p>These rules are obviously aimed at making free speech inconvenient and restrictively expensive for most people.&nbsp; Free speech is a hard-won right for Americans.&nbsp; Between 1907 and 1916, free speech demonstrations lead by the IWW swept the western United States.&nbsp; In Spokane, the <em>Industrial Worker</em> published a call to all workers to defend their rights: &quot;Wanted -- Men to Fill the Jails&rdquo;.&nbsp; And fill the jails they did!&nbsp; As one Wobbly got dragged from the soapbox and arrested, another would take his place and the call would go out for more &ldquo;footloose rebels&rdquo; from all over the country to hop on a train and come join the fight.&nbsp; The struggle can be seen as a victory as it eventually led to the founding of the American Civil Liberties Union.&nbsp; The Wisconsin chapter of the ACLU is currently working to help defend the right of Wisconsin citizens to speak freely in the Capitol.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/20/2011 - 3:12pm</p>
<p><a href="https://recompositionblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/waves-of-struggle-the-winter-campaign-at-the-post-office-in-edmonton/?mid=5530" target="_blank"><strong>By Phinneas Gage - originally posted at recompositionblog.wordpress.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Christine braced herself, took a deep breath and then jumped up on to a mail tub and began to shout &ldquo;help! help! I am being robbed.&rdquo; A sea of faces stared at her blankly. She got the attention her fellow Letter Carriers, but everyone was looking at her like she was crazy. That was fine, she was acting crazy. &ldquo;Canada Post is robbing every single one of us, they are robbing people collecting pensions, they are robbing workers who aren&rsquo;t even working here yet. We need to stand together, Winnipeg walked out and we need to show them that we have their back and will stand with them&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Some began to nod knowingly; she then explained that workers earlier in the week had walked out in an unlawful strike in Winnipeg over technological change that was causing twelve hour days and massive job loss. She explained that Winnipeg was a testing ground for the new work methods and that the workers in Winnipeg were not just fighting for themselves they were fighting for everyone at Canada Post Corporation. Christine explained the struggle, the stakes, and that our fellow workers in Winnipeg were counting on a show of solidarity from across the country. She may have been a bit dramatic, but she was also being honest, sometimes you have to shout to be heard.</p>
<p class="rteleft">The meeting Christine called was part of a wave of work floor meetings across the city. The wave started at another workplace, Depot Nine. At some of these meetings stewards read statements published by &ldquo;The Workers Struggle with the Modern Post&rdquo; a <a href="https://www.theworkerstrugglewiththemodernpost.blogspot.com/">grassroots Postal Workers blog</a> based out of Winnipeg. Some of the meetings were open assemblies open to all employees, where workers could plan their next steps and air grievances. These meetings were part of a very flexible plan, part strategy and part flying by the seat of our pants. The workers led the struggle and often the official union structures were left behind in the dust as workers on the floor took initiative. This wasn&rsquo;t centrally planned but it didn&rsquo;t just happen spontaneously. It wasn&rsquo;t outside and against the union nor was it a struggle within it against some abstract bureaucracy- we were trying something new on our own terms.</p>

<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/LLSB.jpg" />I was raped by a boyfriend on August 18th, 2006. The very next day I held back tears while I lied to a stranger over the phone about why I was unavailable to go in that day for a second interview for a job that I desperately needed. When I hung up the phone I saw a new text message. It was from him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over. It will never be over between us&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day I went in for the second interview. It was inside of the Sears Tower Starbucks in Chicago. I took the train to the interview constantly looking around me and shaking. I needed work. I had just been fired from Target two weeks prior and had no prospects. I knew I would have to go through a metal detector in order to enter the building so despite every instinct in my body I did not bring a knife with me.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">&ldquo;What would you do if you caught a coworker stealing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>My mind is racing. I&rsquo;m thinking that I risked my safety by leaving my house for a stupid job that pays $7.75/hr. Aren&rsquo;t I worth more than that? Aren&rsquo;t we all worth so much more?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell management right away, of course. I&rsquo;ve never understood why someone would steal from work&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I tell them what they want me to.</p>
<p>I started working at Starbucks on August 22, 2006. That was a little over five years ago. Every year we have annual reviews where I generally get to argue with someone younger than me who makes significantly more than do about why my hard work, aching back, cracking hands, sore wrists, the bags under my eyes, the burns, the bruises on my arms, the cuts on my knees, the constant degrading treatment by the customers, the &ldquo;baby, honey, sugar, bitch&rdquo;, the &ldquo;hey, you, slut&hellip;I said NO whip cream!&rdquo;s, the staring, the following after work&hellip;I get to argue why all that means I&rsquo;m worth a 33cent raise rather than 22cents, Degrading for any worker. Degrading especially for a woman worker. Only for me, I get to do this every year just four days after the anniversary of when someone I was in love with raped me. My annual review is truly the only reason I&rsquo;m reminded of the anniversary of the assault.</p>

<a href="../history/library/iww/general-strike-didnt-happen-report-activity-iww-wisconsin/" rel="bookmark">The general strike that didn&#039;t happen: a report on the activity of the IWW in Wisconsin</a>
</h2>
<p><em>This is a report written by two IWW organizers from out of state on the activities of the union during the height of the protests in Madison and Wisconsin. The version is slightly modified from a text sent to the 2011 Delegate Convention and reflects the opinion of the </em>authors.</p>
<p><strong>By Juan Conatz and Brendan Sawyers</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" width="300" src="../sites/default/files/images/tumblr_lhwry1Jbe51qduy0jo1_r1_1280.png" alt="" />Shortly before Valentine&rsquo;s day of 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker announced a budget bill which, along with a package of severe neoliberal cuts to social services, took the unprecedented measure of effectively outlawing unions for state or municipal employees. In order to &lsquo;balance the budget&rsquo;, the bill made it illegal for unions and public entities to negotiate on any conditions (work safety, hours of work, pensions, healthcare) other than wages, and outlawed any contracts which would give wage increases above the official rate of inflation, unless a referendum was held to approve those raises.</p>
<p>Furthermore unions would no longer be able to rely on the &lsquo;dues check-off&rsquo;, in which the employer collects the dues on behalf of the union. Finally, unions would be required to undergo a &lsquo;re-certification&rsquo; election every year in order to be considered legitimate bargaining agents. On top of this were roughly 20% pay-cuts for all public employees!</p>
<p>From the start, Walker acknowledged the power that workers had to shut down the state: against the possibility of a strike by prison guards who form a large portion of Wisconsin's state employees, he threatened to use the Wisconsin national guard as strikebreakers. To ensure loyalty, the Police and Firefighters&rsquo; unions would keep their bargaining rights, although they would still take a pay cut (although this eventually changed).</p>
<p>This was an especially drastic move in the traditionally labor-oriented Wisconsin, home of the first socialist member of Congress and the <a class="bb-url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zeidler">last socialist mayor of a major city</a> (Milwaukee), not to mention the &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; Republicans of <a class="bb-url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette,_Sr.">&lsquo;Fighting Bob&rsquo; Lafollette</a>. On February 14, 2011, after seventeen hours of testimony by the public on how the bill would effect them, the large group of people in the capitol realized that their testimony was not going to stop the bill, and that they were already effectively occupying the Capitol. They decided to stay. At the same time, teachers in Madison and several other school districts held effective sick-outs - in other words unofficial strikes - that were supported by student walkouts and lasted for several days.</p>
<p>In response to this mass ferment of working-class activity there was an emergency meeting of Midwestern IWW members (Twin Cities, Madison, Chicago) to plan an organized response and activity within the growing demonstrations. The participants decided to make an absolute priority of agitating for a general strike. Within this strategy, they examined the specific abilities of the Madison branch, as they were closest to the epicenter. The Madison IWW was a relatively small and somewhat disorganized branch, having a few of Madison&rsquo;s many worker-owned cooperatives affiliated with it, but with years having passed with no independent shop-floor organizing. The Madison IWW nevertheless had one attribute that many IWW branches lack: of its small membership, a large number were &lsquo;dual-carders&rsquo;, that is, workers who hold a red IWW membership card along with their membership in a business union. These dual-carders ranged from an apprentice in the building trades to several long-time members of public sector unions, all of whom were known to the labor-left of Madison as basically solid militants.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 12/13/2011 - 3:41pm</p>
<p><img height="321" align="right" width="300" src="../sites/default/files/images/PortShutdown.preview.jpg" alt="" /><strong>By Richard Meyers - </strong><em>This article was originally published on </em><a href="https://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/13/1044758/-Perspective:-Unions,-OWS,-Blocking-the-Ports?mid=55110" target="_blank"><em>Daily Kos</em></a><em> and reused under </em><a href="http://<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" target="_blank">"><em>fair use guidelines</em></a><em>.&nbsp; Fellow Worker Meyers is involved with Occupy Denver. The opinions expressed here are the author's alone.<br />
</em></p>
<p>There's a debate raging over the OWS port shutdowns, and the role of unions in the shutdowns. Some believe workers have been betrayed; others claim that unions simply cannot signal their support.</p>
<p>Suggesting that a union <strong>does</strong>, or <strong>does not</strong> support an action like shutting down the ports (on the basis of what we've seen so far) is a gross oversimplification. In the first place, the no-strike clause has legal implications, with the result that statements of position may exist primarily to satisfy legal obligations.</p>
<p>Second, as we have apparently seen with ILWU 10, there may be significant differences in position and perception between local leadership and national/international leadership.</p>
<p>Third, all of those stating in comments on other KOS articles that they've drawn conclusions based upon what has been published ought to hold their breath; we've never before seen a global movement like OWS interact with a mainstream labor movement before. It is very likely, in spite of pronouncements, that many union leaders at the local <em>AND</em> the national level hadn't yet formed opinions on a one day demonstration port shutdown; many will have awaited the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of, and the public's reactions to, the day's actions.</p>
<p>The history of the labor movement, characteristics of the labor bureaucracy, and the success of the effort (operationally, and perceptually) will play a role in what is about to unfold.</p>
