<p>RICHMOND, Virginia - February 15, 2016 - Inmates of the Virginia Department of Corrections have called for an end to abusive conditions in a statement released earlier this week. Calling themselves the "Free Virginia Movement," in solidarity with the Free Alabama Movement, the incarcerated workers within Virginia's prison system have joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in hopes to improve living and working conditions throughout Virginia's prisons and to repeal a series of state laws enacted in 1994 which effectively abolished parole.</p>
<p>The stated goals of the organization include an across the board reinstatement for eligibility of parole, the reinvestment of interests gained from inmates&rsquo; funds into rehabilitation, job training, and education programs, and an exemption for those with life sentences from paying 10 percent of their wages into a post-release savings fund.</p> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../content/free-alabama-movement-spreads-virginia-prisoners-take-iww-banner/" title="Read the rest of Free Alabama Movement Spreads to Virginia as Prisoners Take Up IWW Banner.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

<a href="../content/joe-hill-100-road-show-tour-conducts-concerts-three-dozen-cities/" rel="bookmark">Joe Hill 100 Road Show Tour Conducts Concerts in Three Dozen Cities</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/27/2016 - 12:58am</p>
<p><b>By Ron Kaminkow - January 25, 2016</b></p>
<p><img width="320" height="415" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/joehill0.jpg" alt="" />On November 19th, 1915 a poor Swedish immigrant was executed by firing squad in Salt Lake City, Utah. And while his legal assassination was protested worldwide and his name was briefly a household word 100 years ago, today most people have never heard the name of this migrant worker, hobo, union organizer, song writer, satirist and agitator. But throughout the course of 2015 &ndash; 100 years after his execution &ndash; dozens of concerts, plays, sing alongs and other gatherings were conducted across the United Sates in remembrance of this man &ldquo;who never died&rdquo; &ndash; Joe Hill.</p>
<p>The Joe Hill Road Show 100 Tour was an ambitious effort to bring the words, music and ideas of Joe Hill to the people. In some three dozen performances around the country &ndash; starting in Chicago on May 1 (International Workers&rsquo; Day) and ending in Salt Lake City the day after his execution &ndash; crowds were treated to renditions of Joe&rsquo;s songs as performed by a series of different musicians. While some of the crowds were small and others large, all shows on the tour were spirited events with lots of audience participation, enthusiasm, and laughter, all infused with the spirit of labor solidarity.</p>
<p>Performers at the various shows included a number of professional travelling musicians, others regionally based, as well as local talent, invited up on stage to join in the fun. Some of the musicians included: Anne Feeney, Mark Ross, Bucky Halker, George Mann, J.P. Wright, Marc Revenson (Lil&rsquo; Rev), Tim Gorelanton, Patrick Dodd, David Rovics, Duncan Phillips, Otis Gibbs, Charlie King, Greg Artzner &amp; Terry Leonino of &ldquo;Magpie,&rdquo; Jan Hammarlund, and Chris Chandler.&nbsp; Joining them in at least three cities, the Labor Chorus in each added another dimension, a unique element to these shows, one that encouraged group singing. They performed in union halls, taverns, community centers, concert halls, churches, and even in an old wooden boxcar by the railroad tracks in Northern California. Shows took place in 18 states in the following towns and cities: Chicago and Batavia, IL; Madison, Milwaukee, Sheboygan, Oshkosh and Green Bay, WI; St. Paul, MN; Indianapolis, IN; Washington, DC; Baltimore, MD; Philadelphia, PA; Ithaca, NY; Schenectady, and New York, NY; Barre, VT; Springfield and Cambridge, MA; Louisville and Lexington, KY; Nashville and Knoxville, TN; Atlanta, GA; San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Nevada City and Weed, CA; Reno, NV; Phoenix, Eugene and Portland, OR; Bellingham, WA and Salt Lake City, UT. Additional commemorative events not sponsored by the Joe Hill 100 group were held in numerous other locales including Denver, CO and Oakland, CA.</p>
<p>So why all the fuss over an itinerant immigrant, shot to death 100 years ago? If Joe had been a loner, just another one of millions of isolated and destitute workingmen around the turn of the 20th century, he would have certainly died in obscurity. But Joe Hill (born Joel Emmanuel Haaglund), quickly assimilated to his new environment in the US, refused to be treated unfairly, joined the union that at that time was organizing unskilled transient workers (the Industrial Workers of the World) and found his voice. And what a voice that turned out to be! Joe composed hundreds of songs, never asked a penny for his services, and donated all of his works &ndash; songs, poems, cartoons &ndash; to the workers of the world to use as they saw fit to fight the class struggle. Workers from &ldquo;San Diego up to Maine in every mine and mill&rdquo; were soon singing Joe&rsquo;s songs at work, on the picket line, on the street corners, on the soap box and in the jails. Yes, wherever workers would &ldquo;strike and organize&rdquo; that would be where you would hear the songs of Joe Hill.</p>
