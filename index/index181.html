</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 08/20/2007 - 3:28am</p>
<p><img width="261" height="196" border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU660/sbux/89781.jpg" />By Diane Krauthamer</p><p>Despite Starbucks&rsquo; international union-busting attempts, workers and their supporters are telling the company that they are not backing down. Increased organizing and support is growing like wildfire throughout Europe and the U.S., and this past weekend proved once again that the struggle is far from over. <br /><br />On August 18, 2007, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and No Sweat held a successful National Day of Action against Starbucks, with demonstrations in ten cities across the UK, including Glasgow, Leeds, Edinburgh, Leicester and London. <br /><br />Although the company has more than 500 stores with over 5,000 workers and continues to expand in the UK, management is growing nervous as negative publicity surrounding their unfair labor practices increases regionally. <br /><br />In London, small groups spent the morning distributing informational leaflets to baristas at both Starbucks and Caff&eacute; Nero, another major UK coffee chain with working conditions that parallel those of Starbucks. Starbucks baristas are paid just above the minimum wage and are subject to excessive working hours and unpaid overtime. Additionally, baristas must work at a relentless pace, resulting in repetitive strain injuries. <br /><br />By 2 PM, the groups convened in front of the New Oxford Street Starbucks, a busy shopping district in the central city. More than 30 people spent the windy Saturday afternoon protesting and distributing information to customers, workers and onlookers. In addition to the dozens of protesters, undercover police officers and regional management also made a presence at the event. Two police officers were spotted across the street from the demo, illegally taking photos of individuals from the IWW and No Sweat. <br /><br />One of the managers, wearing a beige sweater as a feeble attempt to conceal his company t-shirt, sat inside the store &ldquo;reading a newspaper&rdquo; while keeping the protest under surveillance. When I asked him if he was there to protest, he said he just wanted to make sure that nothing would &ldquo;get out of hand.&rdquo; He admitted that the company had already known about the protest beforehand, despite the fact that the protest location was only communicated over email, and not made public. <br /><br />The manager asked if we were planning any other demonstrations, and when everyone packed up to go home, he followed the group down the street. <br /><br />As Starbucks' headquarters in Seattle is advising regional management in the UK to embark on campaigns of surveillance and intimidation&mdash;as they have done in the U.S., France and Germany&mdash;workers are not backing down. Many baristas showed interest in joining the union, and many potential customers turned away from the store when they received information about the company&rsquo;s practices. Continued harassment is evidence that the company who sets the world's coffee industry standard feels threatened by the power of radical unionizing and solidarity that continues to expand across international borders <br /> </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_410 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/british-isles-regional-administration/" rel="tag" title="British Isles Regional Administration">British Isles Regional Administration</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_272"><a href="../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/starbucks/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Starbucks campaign.

<div><img border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/portraits/UtahPhillips/utah2small.jpg" />Dear Friends, </div><br /> <div>A dozen years ago I was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure. At that time I was finding it increasingly difficult to follow my trade. I stopped touring and pretty well assumed that my performing life was over. It was a very difficult time, but we(Joanna and I)with the help of friends throughout the music world kept the ship afloat. Your help was the ark that bouyed us over those hard times. I created &quot;Loafer's Glory-Hobo Jungle of the Mind&quot;, a syndicated radio show to make a living in one place. But the underwriting didn't materialize and so I found it necessary to go back to the stage, although in a more limited way. Fortunately through proper medication, particularly cordorone, exercise, yoga, diet and a 3-day-a week cardiac rehab class at the local hospital, I had become stronger, lighter, and more confident of my ability to travel and work. So, I suspended the radio show and all fund raising on our behalf and with the help of Jim Fleming and friends a nd comrades at Fl eming Artists, and of course the folk music community, I went back to work. </div> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_35 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/recreational-worke/" rel="tag" title="
