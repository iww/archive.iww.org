</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 02/07/2018 - 8:12pm</p>
<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/fast-food-workers-portland-launch-strike-burgerville/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, February 1, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../sites/default/files/images/RAFfightracism-1-1068x625_0.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="187" align="right" />In Portland, Oregon, fast food workers with Burgerville USA have walked off the job and launched a strike. In recent months, more Burgerville workers in a variety of stores have joined the union, the revolutionary anti-capitalist Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). What follows is a direct report and announcement on the strike from the Burgerville Workers Union. Follow their social media accounts on </em><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BVWkrUnion"><em>Twitter</em></a><em> and </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/burgervilleworkersunion"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> for up to the minute updates, and be sure to check </em><a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/?s=Burgerville+Workers+Union"><em>our past coverage of their struggle</em></a><em> as well as </em><a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-service-workers-revolt/"><em>their appearances</em></a><em> on </em><a target="_blank" href="https://itsgoingdown.org/igdcast-take-job-organize/"><em>our podcast</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Workers at the Convention Center Burgerville just walked off the job, launching a strike and kickstarting the biggest weekend of action yet from the Burgerville Workers Union.</p>
<p>April will mark the BVWU&rsquo;s second anniversary of going public. Since 2016, our demands have largely remained the same: fair wages, consistent scheduling, and affordable health care. We as a union have grown since then. We have found new ways to support each other, and<span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;we have won victories in the workplace that make the weight of our day to day lives easier to bear.</span></p>
<p>Despite all of this, however, Burgerville still refuses to negotiate with the union. The company continues to ignore the voices of its workers, prioritizing profits over the human needs of the workers who make those profits possible.</p>
<p>We are on strike today because no one deserves to live in poverty. Life in Portland only gets harder &ndash; rents go up, groceries get more expensive, and Burgerville wages stay unlivable.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 02/01/2018 - 8:41pm</p>
<p><strong>By editor - <em>Industrial Worker</em>, February 1, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/IW2018A.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="320" height="414" />The brightly colored art on the cover of IW is one of a large series of paintings and drawings of working men, women, and children by Mexican artist Alfredo Ramos Martinez. Fifteen years older than his more well-known compatriot Diego Rivera, Ramos Martinez blazed the path for the Mexican Modernist movement in his paintings and murals. While Ramos Martinez's works did not romanticize, they offered serene depictions of Mexicans at work and at home in rural and small-town settings. The art that Rivera would create&mdash;especially his fresco murals&mdash;would be full of machinery, toil, action, bosses, and class-conscious workers.</p>
<p>This quarter's theme is &quot;Wobblies and Workers in the Arts.&quot; An article by FW Raymond Solomon looks at TV sitcom depictions of working people starting in the 1940s (radio and a film, first) and 1950s and jumping to the 1970s and 1980s. Few sitcoms are solely comedic, and it's when looking at jobs, pay, and the need for both that situations get serious. Another piece, by a lover of film who has run movie theaters, taught film programs to children and high school students, and currently books films for several &quot;arthouses&quot; across the U.S., chooses six films that show work and working people living lives their jobs affect immeasurably.</p>
<p>Wobblies John Kaniecki and Craig Bledsoe look at two different kinds of art: Kaniecki is a writer and poet, and he describes what and who inspire and &quot;move&quot; him to create art in words. Bledsoe chooses the Industrial Revolution as the point at which to start his analysis of visual arts and the movements that developed out of social and political changes and the philosophies that defined them. And I asked a friend whom I've seen grow up over the last 14 years to watch Cradle Will Rock, Tim Robbins' 1999 film, with me and then write about it. She may not have realized it, but her take on the movie&mdash;which is about the heady period in the 1930s where unemployment and poverty were devastating but art was allowed to flourish through the WPA, the Roosevelt Administration's program that employed artists and writers of all kinds to create and teach art to a dispirited population&mdash;is very much one of a young woman who is looking ahead at most of her life, while she does everything she can to maintain her optimism in the face of a daunting present.</p>

<p><strong>By BVWU - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-union-pickets-expands-into-more-stores/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, January 25, 2018</strong></p>

<p>On Wednesday, January 24th, the Burgerville Workers Union (BWU) held its first picket of 2018 outside of a Burgerville store in Portland. BWU is a part of the revolutionary anti-capitalist union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and in the past year has grown to include workers in a variety of stores across the chain. Burgerville, which brands itself as a &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;woke&rdquo; large fast food corporation, has refused to negotiate with BWU, and has even hired anti-union goons in an attempt to stop the IWW, as well as firing various organizers over trivial incidents.</p>

<p><strong>By IWOC - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/first-incarcerated-worker-industrial-union-branch-forming/" target="_blank">It's Going Down</a>, January 18, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/1z.png" alt="" align="right" width="320" height="196" />The following article from the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) announces that the Mandingo Warriors & Associates has put in an application to be the first union branch to be chartered inside of prison.</span></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Industrial Workers of the World&rsquo;s (IWW) Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) is excited to announce our first Incarcerated Workers Industrial Union 613 branch application. The charter is currently being reviewed by the IWW's General Executive Board. When approved, this will be the first ever IU613 Branch in IWW history. In fact it will be the very first Incarcerated Workers union branch period. Below is their announcement of the formation and a riveting history of prison organizing over the past few decades.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS &amp; FELLOW WORKERS,</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On behalf of &ldquo;Mandingo Warriors &amp; Associates&mdash;IWW/IWOC,&rdquo; we would like to express our most sincere gratitude and appreciation regarding the valuable time, efforts and sacrifices that you, along with the entire IWW/IWOC revolutionary family of this Struggle, have put into this difficult and complex &ldquo;dilemma&rdquo; of pursuing the necessary steps required to &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; assist in the organizing of those of us, whom are incarcerated within the numerous &ldquo;Business Corporations&rdquo; disguised as &ldquo;Reformative Institutions&rdquo; (Aka Prisons), around Unifying Principles and a Universal Philosophy that is inclusive of all of Humanity (this is definitely a Struggle Rooted in Equality for all of Humanity and not just the Few &amp; Wealthy!)&hellip;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall hope and pray that all of our Comrades, in the &ldquo;Semi-Free Society,&rdquo; are doing well and are enjoying the best of health possible. Your most recent communication (dated: 10/20/&rsquo;17) was well received and we look forward to receiving future communications from any and all IWW/IWOC members (with a robust invitation to the African People&rsquo;s Caucus) in the near future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before We/I begin to address your most recent letter, Comrade it is our responsibility to inform and make you guys aware of the latest developments concerning the Movement of our Branch&hellip; You guys will have no doubt noticed the change in name/title&mdash;&ldquo;Mandingo Warriors &amp; Associates&mdash;IWW/IWOC&rdquo; (M.W.A.&mdash;IWW/IWOC), from the previous name-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting was held, 10/27/&rsquo;17, in response to your letter and concerning IWW/IWOC&rsquo;s agenda in general. Amongst the few issues that were discussed and resolved, included the uncertainty of some, as-to whether IWW/IWOC represent the realities of True Revolutionary Movement, or, will the Tribe (another name used to describe the entirety of the M.W organization)&mdash;as a Revolutionary organization in-and-of-itself, be bounding itself, by mutual agreement, to Honor, Respect, Uphold and abide by the Constitution, By-Laws, Principles and General Philosophy (whenever related to IWW affairs) of a bunch of &ldquo;Armchair&rdquo; Revolutionaries, who pontificate upon revolutionary concepts, but, fall far short of actual Revolutionary Movement (The Tribe has been &ldquo;burnt&rdquo; by such &ldquo;revolutionary organizations&rdquo; before, in which &ldquo;they talk a good game,&rdquo; but, when the &ldquo;heat&rdquo; is turned-up they are &nbsp;nowhere to be found&hellip;)&hellip;</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 01/22/2018 - 7:52pm</p>
<p><strong>By Stardust Family Unted - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/new-york-wobbly-waiters-stage-sip-demand-iww-recognition/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, January 17, 2018 </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>This following report and video comes from the Stardust Family Diner, which is a group of workers who are fighting as part of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to be in a union. Recently the workers won the rehiring of several dozen employees who were fired in an anti-union campaign conducted by management.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthanatosgonzales%2Fvideos%2F10154606622636155%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="317" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Some footage (video, above) from (January 16, 2018) &ldquo;Sip In&rdquo; at Stardust diner, where servers and former staff are fighting for the right to join a union (that&rsquo;s right, they&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">don&rsquo;t even have the right to fight for their rights), along with a laundry list of other abuses perpetuated by management.</span></p>
<p>The idea was to disrupt the Saturday dinner rush&mdash;several arrived, were seated, and only ordered water (with copious amounts of lemon), stayed for an hour or so, tipped the server generously (so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be punished financially), and then as we left, told the manager that they should allow the servers to join the union.</p>
<p>The very talented singing staff started the action by singing Twister Sister&rsquo;s &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Not Gonna Take It&rdquo; (feat. in the musical &ldquo;School of Rock&rdquo;), then went into Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Union Maid.&rdquo; During the chorus (&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t scare me, I&rsquo;m sticking to the union&hellip;&rdquo;), those participants in the diner, stood up, held their waters and ketchup bottles aloft and sang along (To the wtf-bewilderment of all the tourists). Then one of the servers who was fired last week for joining the union came in off the streets, grabbed a mic, and somehow turned &ldquo;New York, New York&rdquo; into an accusatory political anthem. She stood on the booth, pointed to the patrons, and after she belted the final note, raised her fist, and shouted &ldquo;Worker&rsquo;s Rights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Best dinner in quite a while&hellip;</p>
