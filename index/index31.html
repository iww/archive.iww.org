<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 4:56pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/liverpool-iww-spread-message-that-claimant-advocacy-is-not-a-crime/" target="_blank">Liverpool IWW</a>, October 12, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="180" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/scousewobs.jpg" alt="" />This afternoon, members and supporters of Liverpool IWW held an information picket outside the town centre job centre, on Williamson Square. We are one of several IWW groups and other activist organisations holding demonstrations at job centres this week. Scottish Unemployed Workers Network called for solidarity with claimant advocate Tony Cox, who faces court in Forfar tomorrow on the ludicrous charges of threatening behaviour, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/901080539929227/" target="_blank">refusing to give his name and address and resisting arrest</a>. He was arrested at an Arbroath job centre last January, whilst representing a highly vulnerable unemployed woman.</p>
<p>Scottish Unemployed Workers Network assert that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that this case highlights the climate of fear that is evident within many job centres, but that it is not only benefit claimants that are treated with contempt. Welfare advisors are also being subjected to bullying and intimidation, as in the recent case of Mike Vallance at High Riggs Job Centre, when they attempt to represent, often highly vulnerable, benefit claimants. The SUWN will resist any and all attempts to curb the rights of welfare and citizen advocates to represent the unemployed, and we ask you to join us in our fight to ensure that ADVOCACY IS NOT A CRIME.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Liverpool today, we distributed info provided by<a href="http://www.edinburghagainstpoverty.org.uk/node/32" target="_blank"> Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty</a>, backing up with legal statements the fact that &lsquo;advocacy is not a crime&rsquo;. Claimants visiting the job centre took our advice enthusiastically, and were generally pleased that someone was taking a stand against the Department for Work and Pensions, and the bullying regime inside job centres. Our social networking presence also got a number of likes and follows during the picket.</p>
<p>In fact, the response was so positive that we will soon begin a regular series of job centre info distribution pickets, offering advice, encouragement and solidarity to claimants &ndash; who represent some of the most vulnerable elements of the working class.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/14/2015 - 4:48pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2015/10/10/twin-cities-iww-wins-unpaid-wages-from-local-daycare/" target="_blank">Twin Cities IWW</a>, October 10, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="180" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/TwinCitiesDayCare1.jpg" alt="" />This summer, IWW member Anja was fired from her job at Crocus Hill Academy, a daycare. She was told that it was for talking to current and former coworkers about issues with their boss, Imran Khan. Two weeks later, Anja had yet to receive her final paycheck, her personal belongings, or a copy of her personnel file, which she had requested. Three union members from the Twin Cities IWW branch accompanied Anja to the daycare to deliver a demands letter. Mr. Khan reacted aggressively, shouting at and threatening the union delegation, accusing Anja of mistreating children, and calling St. Paul Police. He refused to accept the letter, and police asked IWW members to vacate the property.</p>
<p>The following day, a larger group of IWW members leafleted the daycare. As Mr. Khan yelled from the door, union members talked to parents about Anja&rsquo;s firing and other grievances. Upon Mr. Khan&rsquo;s continued refusal to receive the letter, branch members conducted a call-in and social media campaign against Crocus Hill Academy. Within a few days, Anja received a call from the school&rsquo;s new director, begging her to give him a copy of the demands which Mr. Khan refused to accept. She has since received her final paycheck and an additional check for $120 to compensate for her personal belongings and personnel file, both of which Mr. Khan &ldquo;misplaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manipulative, lying bosses like Mr. Khan are a danger to all working people, especially when they punish workers for protected activity like talking about work conditions and steal wages. But when we stand alone, or when we look to the government for help, we give up our power to fight. When we come together with other working people, we can get what we deserve. Direct action works and solidarity wins. Get in touch with the Twin Cities IWW if you have problems at work.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 10/08/2015 - 3:11pm</p>
<p><strong>By Kevin Rashid Johnson - <a href="../p%3d1251/" target="_blank">Kevin Rashid Johnson</a>, June 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/GDc.jpg" alt="" />I have, as an active leading member of the New Afrikan Black Panther Party &ndash; Prison Chapter (NABPP-PC), recently joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) upon its founding the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC).<sup><a title="Article II, sec. 1.c. of the IWW Constitution permits membership to unpaid officers of political parties." class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_0_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_0_1251">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The IWOC&rsquo;s stated purpose is to &ldquo;function [ ] as a liaison for prisoners to organize each other, unionize, and build solid bridges between prisoners on the inside and fellow workers on the outside.&rdquo;<sup><a title="The Incarcerated Worker, Vol. 1, No. 1, January 2015, p.1" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_1_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_1_1251">2</a></sup>&nbsp; To this end the IWW has recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners are on the front lines of wage slavery and forced slave labor where refusal to work while in prison results in inhumane retaliation and participation in slave labor contributes to the mechanisms of exploitation. The [IWW] has consciously grasped the importance of organizing prisoners so that prisoners can directly challenge prison slavery, work conditions, and the system itself: break cycles of criminalization, exploitation, and the state sponsored divisions of our working class.&nbsp; At the same time, the prison environment and culture is a melting pot of capitalistic and exploitative tactics and all forms of oppression.&nbsp; These poisons must be challenged in prisons, institutions, and in all of us, through organized working class solidarity.&rdquo;<sup><a title="Ibid." class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_2_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_2_1251">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NABPP-PC has unity with this line and purpose, and allies with the IWW to these and broader ends.&nbsp; Indeed we have for years advanced the idea of extending union membership to prisoners.<sup><a title="See, Kevin &ldquo;Rashid&rdquo; Johnson, Promoting Proletarian Consciousness as Prisoner Rehabilitation (2007), http://rashidmod.com/?p=374" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_3_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_3_1251">4</a></sup> So the IWOC&rsquo;s founding is right on time!</p>
<p>The NABPP-PC is not a traditional communist party, but rather a pre-party formation that advances the cause of revolutionary intercommunalism, and whose target base is the oppressed urban masses and prisoners (the lumpen and unemployed in particular<sup><a title="For an analysis of our line on the lumpen and the proletariat as our mass base, see, Kevin &ldquo;Rashid&rdquo; Johnson, The NABPP-PC: Our Line (2005), http://rashidmod.com/?p=286" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" id="identifier_4_1251" href="../p%3d1251/#footnote_4_1251">5</a></sup> ) of all nationalities, &ldquo;races,&rdquo; etc., but especially New Afrikans/Blacks.&nbsp; Within the NABPP-PC we have the White Panther Organization (WPO) and Brown Panther Organizing Committee (BPOC), which operate as arms of the NABPP-PC to bring our line and strategy to all other oppressed peoples.</p>
<p>The NABPP-PC is guided by the ideological and political line of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM).&nbsp; We unite in camaraderie with all whom we can to oppose the oppressive capitalist imperialist system, racism and repression, whether they share our line or not.</p>
<p>Various strata of the working class in Amerika have been spontaneously rising in protest against unsatisfactory work conditions and wages.&nbsp; From those in the lower service trades, to teachers, to public sector workers.&nbsp; Many have been oriented to more radical politics than mere trade unionism which only aspires to workplace and wage reforms.&nbsp; This was evidenced in the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in September 2011 and quickly spread across Amerika.&nbsp; Various &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; sectors have been reaching for political lines that address greater social ills like capitalist driven environmental crisis, imperialist wars, the proliferation of &ldquo;terroristic&rsquo; violence especially in regions of the world destabilized by the policies and actions of the US and its allies, police violence, sexism, prevailing racism, mass imprisonment, etc. Only a thoroughgoing revolutionary political line can connect clear analyses and solutions with these questions.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/30/2015 - 9:11pm</p>
<p><b>By Angry Language</b><b> - <a target="_blank" href="https://libcom.org/blog/language-workers-got-tallents-27092015">LibCom.Org</a>, September 27, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/180x187xEWIU620.jpg.pagespeed.ic.fpDvhmbgjh/" />Ultimately, we were forced to go down the legal route. That means that IWW members at LSSE only got the legal minimum, despite our belief that the callous mistreatment we suffered while at the school entitled us to further compensation. In any case, we got more than Craig had ever planned to give us.</p>
<p>We're proud to say that in our effort to make Craig pay up, the workers ran militant and well-organised campaign. We occupied the school. We forced Craig <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/struggle-leicester-square-school-english-story-so-far-15012015" target="_blank">to resign as a governor of the Bancroft School</a> and to <a href="http://asparagusconsulting.com/" target="_blank">shut down the website of another one of his business interests, Asparagus Consulting</a>. We <a href="../content/callout-24-hour-email-campaign-target-wage-stealing-boss/" target="_blank">hassled him at his residents' association</a>. We held numerous <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/picket-leicester-square-school-english-21012015" target="_blank">pickets and protests</a> in Leicester Square and at the <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/lsse-struggle-next-stop-drapers-09022015" target="_blank">Drapers' Guild</a>, where Craig is a member of some note &ndash; actions which did not go unnoticed by senior officers of the organisation.</p>
<p>To any other workers who may ever have the misfortune to work for Craig, we have a message for you: if he mistreats you in any way, you've got the support of the Angry Language Brigade and the IWW. It doesn't matter if you're a language school worker or not; if Craig's your boss, we got your back.</p>
<p>And let this be a message to any future would-be business partners: Craig Tallents is a toxic asset. Besides his consistently underhanded business practices, he's got two organisations who are ready and willing to picket and protest anywhere he sets up shop.</p>
<p>Jon Bigger, the IWW caseworker who helped the workers, said &ldquo;this case was a good example of a boss trying to hide when the going got tough. Future workers and business partners of Craig Tallents will no doubt take note of his actions. Bosses should take note of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those who've followed the dispute, one of the key issues was that Craig had illegally and intentionally misclassified a number of teachers as self-employed. This meant that when Craig shut down the school, he thought he could do so without paying those teachers thousands of pounds in holiday and notice pay.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you've been misclassified &ndash; <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/tackling-uks-“freelance”-tefl-scandal-18112014" target="_blank">a major problem in language schools</a> &ndash; you have recourse. Raise it collectively with your workmates or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/status-customer-service-team" target="_blank">contact HMRC</a> who can contact your employer to make them sort out their records and pay you any back pay to which you may be entitled. HMRC can be contacted anonymously, but it's probably best if you have someone like a union rep call on your behalf.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 09/30/2015 - 9:04pm</p>
<p><b>By </b><b>Immanuel Ness - <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/21/us-labor-law-at-80-the-enduring-relevance-of-class-struggle-unionism/" target="_blank"><em>CounterPunch</em></a>, September 22, 2015</b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/clock.jpg" />By embracing collective bargaining through the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, or Wagner Act, organized labor deprived workers of their capacity to contest private and state power. This compromise closed out any possibility of building a mass-based labor movement for decades. Rather than advancing the interests of workers, the NLRA circumscribed workers&rsquo; aspirations for democratic syndicalist and autonomist unions.</p>
<h3><strong>IWW: Alternative to Contract Unionism</strong></h3>
<p>In examining the long-term failure of organized labor, we must first note the alternative, organic, autonomous workers&rsquo; movement embodied in particular by unions affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. From its inception in 1905 until the 1920&rsquo;s, the IWW represented a significant alternative to contract unionism. The IWW stood for the solidarity of <em>all</em> workers and it was fiercely opposed for that reason &mdash; by capital, by reformists such as Daniel DeLeon of the Socialist Labor Party and by the American Federation of Labor (AFL).<a name="_ednref1"><sup><sup>[i]</sup></sup></a> The IWW engaged in a genuine form of democracy and a mass industrial organizing model ultimately adopted by the AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO), which both utilized for very different purposes.<a name="_ednref2"><sup><sup>[ii]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>The IWW employed sabotage, direct action and strikes through the equivalent of workers&rsquo; councils in both the community and at the point of production, while disavowing the legitimacy of the state and recognizing that any agreement with business must be temporary. The Wobblies vigorously negotiated with employers but were never deluded that agreements would bring labor peace.</p>
<p>That the solidarity of all workers was not just talk for the IWW is evidenced by their organization of Blacks, immigrant workers from Mexico and Southeast Asia, and women in, for example, the Bread and Roses Strike. Historian Peter Cole has richly demonstrated that the IWW embraced multiracial unionism, perhaps most notably in Philadelphia&rsquo;s Maritime Workers Local 8, where Black workers maintained a majority.iii</p>
<p>The IWW achieved major gains for U.S. workers into the 1930s while (and because) it emphasized solidarity and workers&rsquo; control. When AFL and CIO unions expanded dramatically as a result of upheaval that began in the early 1930&rsquo;s, they, by contrast, mostly failed to stimulate enthusiasm among workers. Riding the massive wave of sit-down strikes to positions of power, leaders of insurgent unions contributed greatly to sublimating the continuation of such militancy by throwing their support behind modest and incomplete New Deal reforms that ultimately <em>weakened</em> the capacity of workers to confront capital directly. In the area of labor relations, the NLRA was the fulcrum.</p>
<p>Many workers who participated in the sit-down strikes in mass production industries considered unionization synonymous with control over the enterprise, as was recognized immediately by capital. Given the breadth and ongoing militancy of the labor upheaval, the most astute corporate leaders soon expressed willingness to yield select rights provided that employer absolutism in the workplace was maintained. The NLRA proved to be the mechanism for doing so and responsible labor leaders proved willing junior partners in quelling worker militancy. For approximately a year after the wave of sit-down strikes, many workers were surprised to learn that their unions, as sanctioned by the NLRA, set up a framework that restricted their autonomy.</p>
<p>In his account of the Flint sit-down strikes, Sidney Fine wrote of how UAW members &ldquo;were reluctant to accept the customary discipline exercised by management&rdquo; and &ldquo;ran wild in many plants for months.&rdquo; Union committeemen aggressively pressed the grievances of union members upon oftentimes unyielding foremen, and as a UAW member later conceded, &ldquo;Every time a dispute came up the fellows would have a tendency to sit down and just stop working.&rdquo;<sup>iv</sup></p>
