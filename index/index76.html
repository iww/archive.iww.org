<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 05/23/2012 - 8:55pm</p>
<p><b>By Daniel Gross - May 7, 2012</b></p>
<p>We are overjoyed to announce the biggest victory yet from Focus on the Food Chain!&nbsp; Workers at Flaum Appetizing, with your unwavering support, have won their campaign with an exemplary global agreement.&nbsp; Our members have recovered $577,000 in unpaid wages and compensation for retaliation along with a binding code of conduct ensuring Flaum comports with all workplace rights going forward including anti-discrimination and health &amp; safety protections.<br />
<br />
You can check out some of the press coverage on today's victory:<br />

<br />
For over a decade, workers at Flaum Appetizing worked grueling sixty to eighty hour work weeks without overtime pay and sometimes not even the minimum wage.&nbsp; Latino workers were subjected to constant verbal harassment and forced to work at unsafe speeds.&nbsp; Focus on the Food Chain, a joint project of Brandworkers and the NYC IWW, helped the workers launch a powerful campaign that persuaded over 120 grocery store locations to remove Flaum products from their shelves and convinced the world's largest kosher cheese company to stop using Flaum as a distributor until workers' rights were respected. In the process, Flaum workers won a precedent-setting victory at the Labor Board in D.C. helping workers nationwide fend off unfounded allegations into their immigration status.<br />

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 05/22/2012 - 7:57pm</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/IWWPatch1.png" />The International Solidarity Commission of the Industrial Workers of the World condemns the actions taken by the Mossos d'Esquadra, Catalonia police. Laura G&oacute;mez, the General Secretary of CGT-Barcelona was arrested by the Mossos d'Esquadra for trumped up charges that have no basis in fact. It is obvious that this is nothing more than an act of repression and intimidation in response to the growing workers' mobilizations in Spain. We demand the immediate release of Laura G&oacute;mez and the withdrawal of all charges.</p>
<p>We are in solidarity with, and commend, the CGT-Barcelona, Laura G&oacute;mez, and the rest of Spain's working class for their ongoing struggle against police repression and labour injustice.</p>
<p>Solidarity Forever, <br />
International Solidarity Commission <br />
Industrial Workers of the World.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 05/04/2012 - 10:30am</p>
<p><img width="300" height="200" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/CurbsideMayDay2012.jpg" alt="" /><b>By John Reimann</b></p>
<p>The boss was sweating bullets. The IWW was in the house, his workers were about to stop work for May Day, and he wasn&rsquo;t happy about it at all. But there was nothing he could do about it since all his workers were IWW members and they support the union. This was at Buy Back recycling in Berkeley, which functions under an IWW contract as does Curbside Pickups, the work place next door, whose workers were also about to stop work for May Day, 2012.</p>
<p>IWW organizers and union members on the job had been organizing a stop-work rally for the previous two weeks and here it was.</p>
<p>Workers from both work places stopped work for about an hour to celebrate International Workers Day in a work place rally. Most of those who spoke were the Curbside and Buy Back workers themselves, and they spoke about the conditions of their jobs and the attacks on their health benefits and other such concerns. A worker at Curbside had recently had a very serious injury (which resulted in having to have a foot amputated). Several Curbside workers commented on this and the belief that the long hours of overtime may well have been related to this, because when workers are tired accidents are more likely to happen. There were several speakers from outside the work place including Boots Riley, the revolutionary Oakland rap artist, who spoke among other things about his experiences with workers in Italy. Other fellow workers spoke on a number of issues including the history of May Day, issues for grocery workers, and on privatization and the union busting in the Oakland public school system. One noteworthy message of greeting was read from a representative of the Pakistan Labor Party. The message referred to some of the strikes in Pakistan recently and concluded by calling for the workers of the world to unite. The rally concluded with a speech from a fellow worker who called for revolution (and got a good hand of applause for that).</p>
<p>We all gathered round for a group photo taken by one of our members. The executive director of the Curbside operation just &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to be on hand and came running over, a big s___t-eating grin spread over his face. He offered to take the photo for us so that we could all be in the photo at once. We sent him packing.</p>
<p>It was the perfect end to a great event. We started the event by making one boss sweat. We ended it by telling another to get lost. What better way to celebrate International Workers Day?</p>

<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/Chomsky1.jpg" /><b><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/view/2012/04/29-4#.T54CWk-fWmc.facebook" target="_blank">By Noam Chomsky - Sunday, April 29, 2012, originally published at Common Dreams</a></b></p>
<p><i>Noam Chomsky is a dues paying member of the IWW. This editorial is republished in accordance with &quot;Fair Use&quot; guidelines.</i></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a serious revolutionary, then you are not looking for an autocratic revolution, but a popular one which will move towards freedom and democracy. That can take place only if a mass of the population are implementing it, carrying it out, and solving problems. They&rsquo;re not going to undertake that commitment, understandably, unless they have discovered for themselves that there are limits to reform.</p>
<p>A sensible revolutionary will try to push reform to the limits, for two good reasons. First, because the reforms can be valuable in themselves. People should have an eight-hour day rather than a twelve-hour day. And in general, we should want to act in accord with decent ethical values.</p>
<p>Secondly, on strategic grounds, you have to show that here are limits to reform. Perhaps sometimes the system will accommodate to needed reforms. If so, well and good. But if it won&rsquo;t, then new questions arise. Perhaps that is a moment when resistance is necessary, steps to overcome the barriers to justified changes. Perhaps the time has come to resort to coercive measures in defense of rights and justice, a form of self-defense. Unless the general population recognizes such measures to be a form of self-defense, they&rsquo;re not going to take part in them, at least they shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you get to a point where the existing institutions will not bend to the popular will, you have to eliminate the institutions. May Day started here, but then became an international day in support of American workers who were being subjected to brutal violence and judicial punishment. Today, the struggle continues to celebrate May Day not as a &quot;law day&quot; as defined by political leaders, but as a day whose meaning is decided by the people, a day rooted in organizing and working for a better future for the whole of society.</p>
