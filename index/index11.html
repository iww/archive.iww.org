</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:14pm</p>
<p><strong>By Milwaukee IWW, General Defense Committee (GDC) - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/milwaukee-gdc-joins-6k-run-remembrance-temple-shooting/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, August 15, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/1-12-1068x634.jpg" width="320" height="190" align="right" alt="" />On August 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;a 6k run was held in remembrance of the attack on the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. Six victims were killed on August 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2012, Paramjit Kaur, Satwant Singh Kaleka, Prakash Singh, Sita Singh, Ranjit Singh, and Suveg Singh. The shooter was a neo-Nazi named Wade Michael Page living in Cudahy, south of Milwaukee. He was a member of the Hammerskins, a notorious Neo-Nazi Skinhead Gang.</p>
<p>Every August 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;the community remembers those lost. The event focused on a spirit of resilience in the face of tragedy. A dozen members of the IWW joined our fellow worker Jesse, who worships at the temple, to promote the General Defense Committee (GDC) and stand in solidarity with the Sikh community. We participated in the run, tabled with literature, and handed out around 250 fliers.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Text from Outreach Flyer by Jesse:&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the Morning of August 5, 2012, I was getting ready for work like I did every other Sunday. For some strange reason, I decided to channel surf until I was stopped by breaking news about a shooting at a temple. When I learned it was my own temple, I started to cry hysterically &ndash; for the victims, for my community, and in terror of thinking it could have been me if I wasn&rsquo;t working that day. The following weeks were spent in fear of going into public places and full of hate for anyone that looked like Wade Michael Page, the shooter. I became physically exhausted and I finally had to surrender.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Eventually time has healed. Things have returned to normal but I still live in the shadow of that day especially when it comes to verbal abuse by the public. Instead of swelling up with fear or hatred I decided to become an educator about my religion to dispel ignorance. But since the election we have seen a new trend in violence against racial and religious minorities and the LGBT community. The things that I thought I was working to eradicate have seemingly exploded across the country and it will only get worse with further impending economic crisis. I learned that Facebook posts about working on my inner dealings and educating people isn&rsquo;t enough to fight this growing problem we see before us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The only solution is a working relationship with a community of self-defense and working-class power. It&rsquo;s clear we can&rsquo;t look towards politicians to solve society&rsquo;s woes. It is imperative to get active and build the society we wish to see and it starts with organizing the workplace and for community self-defense. We have to learn to see ourselves in others who are targeted by discrimination and injustice because an injury to one is an injury to all.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other Side Of Flyer on GDC:</strong></span></h2>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The General Defense Committee (GDC) is the community self-defense arm of our grassroots labor union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The IWW is a democratically run union for all workers that believes we can use collective action to improve our working conditions and our lives. The General Defense Committee takes these principles and applies them to organizing in defense of our communities, especially in support of targeted groups such as immigrants, racial and religious minorities, and members of the LGBTQ community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The General Defense Committee believes we must not only reject and condemn hate speech, but that we must unite and put forward a vision of equality, solidarity, and collective action.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since our formation the General Defense Committee has acted in solidarity with victims of police violence, staged positive counter-demonstrations when hate groups have threatened to march in our communities, provided marshals for rallies in support of immigrant justice and trained our members in physical self-defense. We work to educate, support, and defend our community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">We hope to continue this type of work and invite all who share our values to join us.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important for us anarchists, socialists, and antifascists to offer our solidarity to a broad range of people. We have to step outside of our comfort zones in radical scenes, in subcultures, and activist circles. We must go to our class, the working class and stand with groups baring the brunt of racism and hate.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 08/25/2017 - 7:03pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://portlandiww.org/2017/08/official-endorsement-voz-workers-rights-education-project-pdx-iww/" target="_blank">Portland IWW</a> - August 15, 2017 </strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/cropped-header1.png" align="right" alt="" />The Portland IWW is proud to endorse Voz: Workers&rsquo; Rights Education Project. Founded in 2000, Voz has been connecting day laborers to work, supporting worker-led organizing, and offering trainings.</p>
<p>Voz is a worker-led organization that gives power to immigrant workers that may not otherwise have the means to organize and bargain for humane working conditions and fair wages. Having the ability to organize and fight for these universal goals gives immigrants the ability to work, to better empower and enrich their communities and lives. </p>
<p>The Voz: Workers Rights Education Project is currently campaigning for their Building The Dream campaign, petitioning the city of Portland for the rights to purchase the property at 240 NE Martin Luther King JR Blvd., to provide immigrant workers and day laborers with a place to meet potential employers, discuss the conditions of their labor, while having the choice to sell their labor to whomever they believe will give them the respect that they deserve.</p>
<p>As such, Voz requires support from community organizations to help them fight for these rights, and to show the city of Portland that the community stands with them and will help defend the exploited and under-privileged workers that move our city and society forward. The Portland Industrial Workers of the World has long worked alongside the VOZ: Workers Rights Education Project and firmly believes that day laborers &ndash; like all workers &ndash; should have secure sites from which to organize and direct their own labor.</p>

<p>August 16, 2017</p>
<p>Charlottesville woman murdered by fascists was not IWW member, is an antifascist hero.</p>
<p>Heather Heyer, the 32-year old murdered by fascists on August 12, 2017, lost her life protesting the fascists. She should be alive with us today. We carry her in our hearts, and move forward with the struggle determined to realize the hopes she held when she faced down the fascists.</p>
<p>On the internet, it has been widely reported that Heather was a member of our union, the IWW. It does not appear that she ever joined our union, but we would have welcomed her. She was a courageous woman and we should all seek inspiration from her and work to amplify her message. Members of the IWW were on the scene and were among the wounded. Like Heather, they courageously stood up to the forces of hate in one of the largest fascist gatherings in decades. We are grateful that they remain with us, and we are furious that Heather is with us no longer.</p>
<p>Rest In Power, Heather. You were a comrade and a hero. We don't forget. We won't forgive. We will continue the fight.</p>

</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are horrified but not surprised at the rise of political violence and murder from the Alt Right and other fascist groups across the country. Today's murder was not an isolated incident, but is the latest in a string of violent attacks and murders from fascists. These include the shooting of an IWW/GDC member in Seattle, the stabbing double murder on the Portland MAX train, and the recent bombing of Dar Al Farooq mosque in Minnesota, among many others.</p>
<p>Fascism is a deadly threat to all of us. There is no escape from the demand that we confront it. Politicians, the police, and the university will not save us. We cannot vote our way to safety. As always, police aided and protected the fascists, while permitting and assisting wholesale violence against counter-protesters. University officials refused to use campus security to protect students and others from a gang of hundreds of fascists.&nbsp;</p> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../content/after-todays-murder-charlottesville-we-must-all-unite-defend-ourselves-and-each-other/" title="Read the rest of After today&#039;s murder in Charlottesville, we must all unite to defend ourselves and each other..">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/IW-Summer-2017.jpg" align="right" alt="" />One hundred years ago&mdash;the summer of 1917&mdash;two events shaped the future of the IWW. </p>
<p>On July 12, 1917, 1,196 striking copper miners in Bisbee, Arizona, were loaded into cattle cars on a train that dropped them in the New Mexico desert. The IWW had been organizing the workers, many of whom were Mexican and could not join the miners' union white men belonged to. On June 27, 1917, the IWW called a strike for flat daily wages of comparable amounts for both under- and above-ground miners, as well as other reasonable demands. Enough workers went out on strike that mining operations were crippled. Therefore, enlisting the aid of Bisbee's Sheriff and around 1,000 men known as the Loyalty League, the mining companies hatched and implemented the plan that resulted in what came to be known as the Bisbee Deportation. </p>
<p>Frank Little was one of the IWW miners' organizers in Arizona and Montana, facing the powerful and ruthless copper-mine owners, who backed up their anti-union aims with a purchased press as well as gunmen, spies, and vigilantes. Fellow Worker Little was lynched by a mob in Butte, Montana, on August 1, 1917.</p>
<p>This issue of <em>Industrial Worker</em> looks at the historical work of agitating and organizing as well as the modern actions IWW members take to advocate for and organize workers marginalized by corporations, law enforcement, and society through actions on the street and in the workplace.</p>
