</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 11/08/2015 - 2:23pm</p>
<p><strong>By Dek Keenan - <a target="_blank" href="https://usilive.org/opinions/wobbling-to-victory/">Union Solidarity International</a>, November 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="240" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/IWGB-3-Cosas.jpg" alt="" />In recent years, new or rediscovered forms of worker self-organisation have begun to appear &ndash; and often in the most unlikely of places.</p>
<p>Small independent unions, using a combination of often audacious direct action tactics combined with innovative campaign strategies are bringing victories to some of the most marginalised and precarious groups of workers. Punching way above their weight, these dynamic new (and some not so new) unions are fighting to win and organising with few or no full-time officials and on shoestring budgets.</p>
<p>Are they the work of anarchist wreckers, alien to the traditions of the labour movement, or do they offer a way out of the impasse that our movement finds itself in?</p>
<p>In London, new unions such as the United Voices of the World (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uvwunion.org.uk/">UVW</a>) and Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (<a target="_blank" href="http://iwgb.org.uk/">IWGB</a>) have been at the forefront of precarious, out-sourced and greatly migrant labour struggles. Recent high profile fights for the Living Wage, for sick pay and the reinstatement of union activists at the Barbican and at Sotheby&rsquo;s auction house have brought the UVW into the media spotlight.</p>
<p>The first signs in the UK of this &lsquo;new unionism&rsquo; were seen in 2011 when the Industrial Workers of the World (<a target="_blank" href="https://iww.org.uk/">IWW</a>), the famous &lsquo;Wobblies&rsquo;, organised a Branch for cleaners in London, recruiting dissatisfied members of Unite associated with the Latin American Workers Association (LAWA).</p>
<p>This Branch built on the existing community of solidarity in the LAWA and, through the establishment of workers&rsquo; advice clinics, language classes and much aggressive outreach by unpaid activists, expanded beyond the Latin American community to other groups of cleaners searching for an effective voice at work. London Living Wage victories at Canary Wharf and elsewhere followed, heightening the profile of the IWW and paving the way for subsequent initiatives from the UVW and IWGB.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/07/2015 - 1:55pm</p>
<p><strong>By Joe Allen - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/amazon-fedex-ups-post-office-teamsters/"><em>Jacobin</em></a>, November 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="244" height="320" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/Fish.jpg" alt="" />It took the United Parcel Service one hundred and eight years to get to its current position in the world today, less than half that time for Walmart, DHL, and FedEx, and just over two decades for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/amazon-google-facebook-privacy-bezos/">Amazon</a>. The speed of transformation in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/logistics-industry-organizing-labor/">global logistics industry</a> is rapidly increasing, spurred on by Amazon&rsquo;s current building spree across North America and Europe.</p>
<p>For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-logistics-facilities-update-2015-10?utm_source=googleplaynewsstand&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">according to&nbsp;<em>Business Insider</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon has added 21 new logistics facilities globally over the last 12 months, up 14% from last year, bringing the total to 173 facilities worldwide. Of the 173 facilities, 104 are in the North America region, with the rest spread across Europe and Asia. The 173 logistics facilities include the large fulfillment-center warehouse; sortation centers, where packages get presorted for shipping; and Prime Now hub, a separate building to store one-hour delivery items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly big things are afoot. Amazon&rsquo;s recent job listing strongly suggests it is building a senior staff for a major logistics and transportation department that includes a&nbsp;&ldquo;Senior Program Manager &mdash; Last Mile Transportation SME,&rdquo; &ldquo;Driver Experience Manager,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Network Manager &mdash; Amazon Logistics Freight.&rdquo; A former Amazon engineer told&nbsp;<em>Business Insider</em>, &ldquo;If Amazon can stop paying FedEx and start controlling their own destiny in terms of the costs of fulfillment and shipping and transportation, it increases their profit margin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another sign of the rapidly transforming logistics industry is&nbsp;UPS&rsquo;s recent purchase of the Chicago-based Coyote Logistics for $1.8 billion. Coyote is a new model of freight forwarding; it has no vehicles or warehouses of its own, and instead provides logistics for 12,000 shippers with a network of 35,000 local, regional, and national carriers.</p>
<p>A decade earlier UPS made its largest acquisition up to that point when it bought Overnite Transportation, a huge non-union freight company. UPS&rsquo;s purchase of Overnite was a major move into the traditional freight business, and followed FedEx&rsquo;s acquisition&nbsp;of several regional freight companies and creation of FedEx Freight.</p>
<p>FedEx is also trying to keep up with the competitive pressures from Amazon and UPS. Earlier this year it acquired the Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express for $4.8 billion &mdash; giving it access to TNT&rsquo;s Europe-wide road network to compete with UPS and DHL &mdash; and FedEx Ground has announced plans to build large facilities in <a target="_blank" href="http://postandparcel.info/66543/news/fedex-aiming-to-build-new-distribution-hub-in-connecticut/" target="_blank">Middleton, CT</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flgov.com/2014/12/30/governor-scott-announces-fedex-ground-building-new-distribution-hub-in-ocala/" target="_blank">Ocala, FL</a>; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2015/03/17/fedex-to-start-50-million-hamburg-project.html" target="_blank">Hamburg, NY</a>.</p>
<p>DHL &mdash; formally DHL Express, a division of Deutsche Post &mdash; is also reinvesting substantially in its US operations, including a $108 million upgrade to its Cincinnati air hub that processes about 46 million international shipments each year. Though it is smaller than UPS&rsquo;s nearby Worldport or FedEx&rsquo;s Superhub, DHL&rsquo;s Cincinnati operations primarily focus on international shipments from Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If DHL is making investments in infrastructure expansion in Cincinnati, that means they&rsquo;re very confident that they&rsquo;re going to continue to grow their intercontinental network,&rdquo; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dhl-to-spend-108-million-to-expand-cincinnati-air-hub-1433101099" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;Brian Clancy, a managing director with Logistics Capital &amp; Strategy, a Virginia-based transportation consulting firm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DHL Global Forwarding signed an agreement with a Kazakhstan-based express company to speed the transit of rail-based freight across the Eurasian continent as an alternative to traditional sea and airfreight. In addition, it announced plans to establish its own parcel network in Austria by 2016 and to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dpdhl.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2015/dhl_invests_47_million_africa.html" target="_blank">invest</a> &euro;47 million in sub-Saharan Africa as part of an effort to derive&nbsp;30 percent of its revenue from&nbsp;emerging markets by 2020.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the scramble, the United States Postal Service (USPS), the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/usps-bronx-privatization-murals-new-deal-art/">venerable</a>, much-derided, and constitutionally mandated mail&nbsp;carrier, has emerged as a major player in the logistics industry.</p>
<p>This summer,&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-30/it-s-amazon-s-world-the-usps-just-delivers-in-it" target="_blank">called</a> the USPS &ldquo;an extension of Amazon&rdquo; and noted that &ldquo;Amazon receives a deep discount from the post office because the e-tailer does so much of its own processing &mdash; including providing computerized address lists to make it easier for carriers to tailor their delivery routes for faster drop-offs.&rdquo; A 2014 estimate by Bernstein Research, which tracks the shipping industry, put the USPS&rsquo;s shipments and deliveries at 40&nbsp;percent of Amazon&rsquo;s volume, or almost 150 million items (UPS accounted for&nbsp;20&ndash;25 percent and FedEx 15&ndash;20 percent).</p>
<p>While UPS, FedEx, DHL, and the USPS are fierce competitors, many people would be surprised by the cooperation between the logistics giants. Both FedEx and UPS have discounted residential package delivery services with the USPS called, respectively,&nbsp;SmartPost and SurePost. And the volume is enormous. Last year, the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-mail-does-the-trick-for-fedex-ups-1407182247" target="_blank">reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For FedEx alone, the post office delivers an average of 2.2 million packages a day, or about 30% of the express-mail company&rsquo;s total U.S. ground segment. UPS won&rsquo;t specify how many&nbsp;of its shipments go through the post office, but a regulatory filing indicates those types of lightweight shipments accounted for 40% &mdash; or about 37 million packages &mdash; of its total increase in ground shipments in 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both SmartPost and SurePost services are designed to deal with the unwanted costs of the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; &mdash; the industry term for the final step in the delivery process, handing over the package to the recipient. FedEx or UPS may have every address in the United States in their databases, but neither wants to go to every address every day, and they certainly don&rsquo;t want to make a second attempt if the recipient isn&rsquo;t home the first time around. The USPS, on the other hand, has to go to each&nbsp;address daily&nbsp;to delivery first-class mail.</p>
<p>Ultimately, UPS and FedEx want to snatch up&nbsp;the most profitable areas and dump the rest. For example, FedEx <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-23/fedex-to-fly-mail-for-postal-service-for-10-5-billion" target="_blank">beat out</a> UPS in 2013 for a seven-year, $10.5 billion contract with the USPS to fly its mail between US airports.</p>
<p>The rising volume of packages has transformed the USPS,&nbsp;necessitating&nbsp;major capital&nbsp;investment. In 2013, the post office spent $200 million to furnish its delivery vehicles with handheld scanners to provide real-time package tracking. And its plan to replace its fleet of 163,000 delivery trucks, which were not designed to hold packages, could cost as much as $4.5 billion.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 11/07/2015 - 1:48pm</p>
<p><strong>By Admin - <a href="https://liverpooliww.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/victory-as-people-power-forces-liverpool-council-homeless-fines-u-turn/" target="_blank">Liverpool IWW</a>, November 5, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="213" align="right" src="https://liverpooliww.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/homelessness.jpg" alt="" />Liverpool Industrial Workers of the World unreservedly welcomes the sensational decision of Liverpool City Council to scrap their consultation on plans to fine the homeless a whole eight days ahead of its planned conclusion. We are delighted that homeless people now no longer face this added threat of being penalised for the social crime of homelessness.</p>
<p>Like Oxford, Hackney and Wycombe authority before them, Mayor Joe Anderson&rsquo;s council has floated the idea, hoping it will go through, only to be overwhelmed by the public backlash against it. In doing so, the council has shown the potential of mass working class action to make changes in the world. Anderson and Liverpool Labour have given way on this one issue, because it risked jeopardising the rest of their austerity agenda.</p>
<p>Only yesterday morning, Liverpool IWW started a Facebook event page proposing a demonstration against the homeless fines. Within hours, scores had pledged they would attend, hundreds of people had been invited, and many were leaving comments on the page. Some raised their own demands, such as Joe Anderson paying back the &pound;89,000 of public money he received from the council for legal advice on a private matter (he&rsquo;d been sacked by a school he did no work for).</p>
<p>The homeless fines threatened to be a &lsquo;straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back&rsquo;. When asked by the media for a reaction in response to Liverpool IWW&rsquo;s press release, the council retreated a step. The council&rsquo;s deployment of pro-cuts Councillor Rachael O&rsquo;Byrne to the Facebook event page confirms this.</p>
<p>Liverpool Labour&rsquo;s explanation for the whole affair beggars belief. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/news-and-comment/plans-to-fine-liverpool-beggars-1000-scrapped">Liverpool Confidential</a> , &ldquo;Anderson intervened to have the scheme scrapped after hearing about the proposals yesterday [Wednesday]&rdquo;. Councillor Steve Munby went on, &ldquo;The proposal was not a decision by the council cabinet, but was drawn up by officers following complaints from residents and the BID [Business Improvement District].&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are charitable to Anderson, it still looks devastatingly bad. He is the mayor of the city, he is paid a large salary, and he dines with the greedy business owners who were pushing this scheme on a very regular basis. If the official story is to be believed, he was somehow unaware of the council consultation nearly a month after it began on 9th October. He is therefore totally out of touch with the affairs of his own council, and totally incompetent.</p>
<p>The far more likely explanation, of course, is that Anderson, O&rsquo;Byrne, Munby and colleagues are simply lying through their teeth.</p>
<p>Liverpool IWW will continue to fight for the interests of all working class people in the local area, so we can guarantee that this is not the last that Mayor Anderson and all his bloodsoaked poverty pimps will hear of us.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 11/04/2015 - 7:15pm</p>
<p class="rteleft"><strong>By Andrew Stewart - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rifuture.org/sex-workers-of-rhode-island-unite.html">RIFuture.org</a>, November 3, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="250" height="250" align="right" alt="" src="http://www.rifuture.org/wp-content/uploads/Madeira-2.jpg" />It is called the oldest line of work in the world and yet it is consistently denied legitimacy. But here in Rhode Island, where prostitution was legal from 1980 until 2009, some local sex workers are re-asserting their agency by organizing a labor union.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see women get raped, you see women get murdered,&rdquo; said Madeira Darling, an organizer, whose name has been changed in this story to protect her identity. &ldquo;Criminalization itself is violence. It means women can&rsquo;t seek protection either from the law or from one another. Occasionally you will get guys who think they are in love with you stalking you. And police will often blame sex workers for violence even if they aren&rsquo;t in criminalized industries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madeira began work as an exotic dancer at age 19 in New York before becoming a dominatrix and relocating to Rhode Island, labor&nbsp;she continues to perform here. She and several of her colleagues are working towards something radically inclusive: the creation of a statewide sex worker labor union.</p>
<p>Interested in creating a truly industrial union, the group is open to allowing all sex workers&nbsp;join her in the effort, reaching out to strippers, escorts, camera/phone workers, porn stars, strip club bouncers, bar workers, masseurs/masseuses, actors, directors, and crew in adult films, and any other laborer in the industry, including the internet workers.&nbsp;As of this point she has contacted four other workers, but hopes that publicizing this effort my grow the ranks.</p>
