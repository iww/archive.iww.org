<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 08/15/2007 - 2:04pm</p>
<div><img width="254" height="228" border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU460/Prov0807/182906081-L-1.jpg" />On Saturday, August 11, 2007, the Providence wobblies organized a march on Jackie's Galaxy, which is a restaurant chain that is being supplied by HWH in New York City, a supplier who is notorious for its slave labor conditions of up to 110 hours per week without basic labor rights (minimum wage and overtime).</div><br /><div>Roughly 30-40 wobblies and supporters (including Providence and Boston SDSers) were marching towards Jackie's Galaxy in North Providence when the police began following them en mass. They told the marches to move to the sidewalk, while this was initially ignored, the marchers listened to the police and began slowly moving to the sidewalk.</div><br /> <div>The police then surrounded the marchers in their squad cars and began getting out. With the police in full force, they began attacking the marchers, one fellow worker, Alex Svoboda, was pinned down by the police during her arrest and suffered a broken and dislocated leg and ruptured blood vessel in the knee. These injuries will require at least two surgeries and extensive rehab and even then may not completely repair the damage. Jason, another wob, was arrested during the police' attack. Ashley, a supporter from Boston, was also severely maced during the attack, suffered chemical burns and required medical treatment.</div> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_679 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/providence-iww/" rel="tag" title="">Providence IWW</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_406"><a href="../category/campaigns/issue-oriented-campaigns/general-defense-committee/" rel="tag" title="General Defense Committee">General Defense Committee</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_553"><a href="../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/nyc-iu460/" rel="tag" title="NYC iu460">NYC iu460</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_23 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-400-manufacture-and-general-product-7/" rel="tag" title="

Worldwide it has over 12,000 stores and employs over 100,000 people. In Britain , it has over 500 stores employing 5,000 workers.<br /> <br /> Starbucks baristas in the UK are barely paid above the minimum wage and are subject to excessive working hours, unpaid overtime; work at a relentless pace, resulting in repetitive strain injuries for many workers. In the US , Starbucks has waged an illegal union-busting campaign resulting in firing of six baristas in New York City .<br /> <br /> Coffee growers receive little more than 0.50p for a pound of coffee, which is then sold for &pound;80.<br /> <br /> Oxfam launched a campaign against Starbucks in October 2006 after it effectively blocked Ethiopia 's attempts to trademark its coffee beans in the United States .<br /> <br /> The tide is turning against Starbucks. In the UK the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is organising the Baristas United Union in several organising campaigns at Starbucks; in the US the IWW-Starbucks Workers Union is expanding across the country; in NZ hundreds of casual fast food workers, including Starbucks baristas organised into the UNITE union; workers are getting organised in France and Germany too.<br /> <br /> 18 August is a national day of action against Starbucks. The IWW, No Sweat and many organisations and supporters are holding protests in cities right around the UK . We are asking the public not to drink at Starbucks today and to show support for the workers and farmers trying to improve their lives and make a living wage.<br /> <br /> Contact us to get involved in the campaign:<br /> <br /> Industrial Workers of the World &ndash; UK<br /> rocsec@iww.org.uk<br /> <a href="http://www.iww.org.uk/">http://www.iww.org.uk</a><br /> <a href="http://www.baristasunited.org.uk/">http://www.baristasunited.org.uk/</a><br /> PO Box 1158 Newcastle upon Tyne<br /> NE99 4XL<br /> <br /> No Sweat<br /> admin@nosweat.org.uk<br /> <a href="http://www.nosweat.org.uk/">http://www.nosweat.org.uk</a><br /> PO Box 36707 London SW9 8YA<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.starbucksunion.org/node/1852">http://www.starbucksunion.org/node/1852</a></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_410 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/british-isles-regional-administration/" rel="tag" title="British Isles Regional Administration">British Isles Regional Administration</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_272"><a href="../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/starbucks/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Starbucks campaign.
