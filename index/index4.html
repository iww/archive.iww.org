</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 07/26/2018 - 8:18pm</p>
<p><strong>Seattle IWW - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/dispatch-from-the-picket-line-iww-fights-lockouts-in-seattle/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, July 25, 2018</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/Group1.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="213" align="right" />The union drive at Grassroots Campaigns Incorporated (GCI) has been nothing short of profound. Throughout months of organizing we built an unparalleled culture of resistance and solidarity and a tangible sense that we don&rsquo;t need bosses to get work done.</p>
<p>At the beginning of May we realized that something was off. May and June are typically the biggest hiring periods with the office frequently swelling to 40 or 50 canvassers by midsummer. This year, though, the interim directors sent by corporate were simply not bringing in new people.</p>
<p>Thanks to shop floor agitation and legal threats, we were able to force the company to begin hiring by the end of May, but we soon found ourselves with a new problem. New hires were being made Field Managers (FMs) on their fourth or fifth days. FMs are similar to shift leads at other jobs but with extra paperwork, no real power, and often no increase in pay. When new workers should have been learning the skills needed to canvass, they were instead being asked to supervise other people.</p>
<p>These new hires felt like they were being pressured to quit by being given such responsibilities so quickly. They joined the union to do something about it. We sympathized with their issue and decided to March on the Boss on Friday, June 8 to demand that new hires get at least two weeks on the job before being asked to take on FM responsibilities. We reasonably expected the current director would accede to our demand on the spot, but, because of the company&rsquo;s consistent and blatant lawbreaking practices, we wanted to have the agreement in writing, which was something the company was incredibly averse to.</p>
<p>Ten of us, including all of the recent new hires, entered the director&rsquo;s office shortly before our morning circle. We delivered our demand and, as expected, she agreed verbally. She stated that she would get us something in writing by the end of the day but that she needed to talk to Laurie Owen (the company&rsquo;s General Counsel and chief union buster) to find out exactly what she was allowed to write. She agreed that one of our members could stay a bit late while she waited for approval.</p>
<p>Most of the office went out to canvass, and the hours ticked by. By noon it was starting to become clear that Laurie wouldn&rsquo;t give us anything. The director was told to write nothing down, although she was assured she had discretion over the policy to ensure all new hires have at least two weeks on the job before taking on FM responsibilities. At lunchtime, one union member pointed out that because we had received a promise to have something in writing by the end of the day, the day couldn&rsquo;t be over until we had it. We all agreed and decided that if we didn&rsquo;t have something by the time we returned from canvassing we would remain on the clock discussing workplace conditions&nbsp;with our manager until she gave us what she had promised.</p>
<p>After the afternoon debriefs, seven people found themselves in the director&rsquo;s office. For the next four and a half hours, there was continuous discussion about workplace conditions with the manager interspersed with songs and teach&shy;-ins. We were told repeatedly that no one would have to leave or be forced to clock out. At 9:45pm, we finally received a written notice from the manager that she could not commit policy to writing. Having forced a response that would greatly aid in future legal matters, we left feeling elated at the power of direct action.</p>
<p>In IU650, the 9th of the month has become something of a harbinger of major events. On March 9, we voted 15&shy;-2 in an NLRB election for federal recognition of our existing union. On April 9, our contract was signed. On May 9, we held a March on the Boss regarding holiday pay that coincided with the New Orleans office filing for an NLRB election. June 9, the day after our sit-&shy;in, proved equally momentous as it turned out to be the first day of our lockout.</p>
<p>We had been preparing for a lockout for the better part of a month. While its immediate arrival was somewhat of a&nbsp;surprise, we were more than prepared to meet it head on. The very first day we received calls from corporate stating that the Seattle office was suspended, but we showed we were more than capable of working even without an open office. This act struck existential fear into management, who now knew we could do our jobs without them. We also had a solid legal case against them, thanks to their admission that the lockout was retaliation for the June 8 action.</p>
<p>Typical companies might obscure retaliatory actions behind a thin smoke screen. GCI, though, has been so blatant and consistent with its lawbreaking that even the NLRB can&rsquo;t help but find sympathy with our arguments.</p>
<p>We continued rolling out a campaign of direct action and workplace self-&shy;organization. On June 14th, we launched a phone zap against the corporate office with the aim of getting hundreds, if not thousands, to call GCI&rsquo;s headquarters and demand they end the lockout. Coinciding with this, we began running our own autonomous canvass in the streets of Seattle designed to build support for the union and get people to join in on the phone zap. This powerful collective action gave us a profound sense of what it means to work for ourselves on our own terms and in control of our own labor.</p>
<p>Picketing started that same day. On Thursday and Friday we held spirited informational pickets outside our locked office in Fremont. We drew attention around the neighborhood and the community. Our numbers swelled from 30 attendees the first day to over 50 on the second. Simultaneously, we received solidarity from around the country with pickets at GCI offices in Denver, Raleigh-Durham, Philadelphia, and at the HQ in Boston. Taking to the streets was both a means of catharsis and community building and, when placed in a national context, had the potential to put serious pressure on GCI&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>We continued to organize over the next few days. We fleshed out our plans for a direct action escalation campaign. Fortunately, those plans became unnecessary on Wednesday, June 20, when almost everyone in the office received a new set of phone calls from corporate: the office would reopen on Thursday. The lockout was over. We had won.</p>

<p><strong>By Burgerville Workers Union - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/burgerville-workers-fight-and-win-job-back/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, July 12, 2018</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/1-4.jpg" width="320" height="185" align="right" alt="" />Report from the Burgerville Workers Union of the IWW who recently fought and won the rehiring of a co-worker.</span></em></p>
<p>Meet Brookelynn, a longtime Burgerville worker at the Gladstone store and a strong union supporter. She worked at Burgerville for two years before leaving the job in December for family reasons. Brookelynn reapplied shortly afterwards, much to everyone&rsquo;s excitement, and it&rsquo;s even Burgerville policy to rehire workers who reapply within three months of quitting</p>
<p>Because of how strong a union supporter she is, however, Burgerville refused to rehire her, violating their own policy. The General Manager, Michael Dawson, hired at least ten other people while Brookelynn kept reapplying, discriminating against her over and over again for her union membership. Meanwhile, Burgerville has spent thousands and thousands of dollars on ads claiming to value their employees and that they do not intimidate or retaliate against workers for being part of the union.</p>
<p>After months of fighting, Brookelynn and the union finally won her job back! She returned to work today and everyone is thrilled. Furthermore, the National Labor Relations Board found merit in Brookelynn&rsquo;s charges of anti-union discrimination, which means Burgerville will likely face legal consequences for their union busting activity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited about the ongoing contract negotiations, but this just goes to show how important it is to keep fighting outside the bargaining room as well.</p>
<p>Welcome back, Brookelynn! When we fight, we win!</p>

<p><em><img src="../sites/default/files/images/Group1.jpg" width="320" height="213" align="right" alt="" />We&rsquo;ve received an incredible outpouring of solidarity during and since the end of out lockout. While we may be able to win back the lost two weeks of wages through court battles down the line, many of our workers may have trouble making rent and paying other vital bills this month with the short paychecks. Any support you can give will go a long way towards helping those folks out and making sure we can stand strong as we continue our campaign.</em></p>

<h3>Statement from IU650</h3>
<p>We are not the first canvassing shop to threaten to Unionize. We aren&rsquo;t even the first canvassing shop to follow up on that threat with an NLRB election.</p>
<p>But in a canvassing shop when you go down that path you always hear the same threat. The Bosses will close down your shop. Thats illegal, so they whisper it, they tell it through innuendo, they imply it with stories about other offices that tried.</p>
<p>On June 11th IU 650 Seattle was informed that operations were suspended at the office. We were locked out in response to legally protected concerted action and they were, you know, basically closing the shop.</p>
<p>We launched into action. We took legal recourse. We reached out to our friends and supporters asking them to help with our call in campaign. We reminded Grassroots Campaigns that we work in the street. You can&rsquo;t lock us out of the street. We organize for a living, they cannot expect us not to organize.</p>
<p>We picketed. Wobblies in multiple cities, from Seattle to Boston took direct action on picket lines. Our IU 650 friends in the Deep South stood up for us.</p>
<p>And people called. Eventually they heard us.</p>
<p>The Seattle office of Grassroots Campaigns reopened its doors on June 21st and the members of IU 650 have returned to work. The terms are still under negotiation, many workers have been forced to change campaigns and it has of course provided cover for yet another round of unilateral changes.</p>
<p>But that office is open.</p>
<p>If you are a canvasser. If you organize folks for a living and your boss tells you that you will be punished for organizing with your coworkers. If they subtly imply that canvassing shops get closed down for organizing.</p>
<p>Seattle says they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all of your help.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 06/20/2018 - 3:49pm</p>
<p><strong>By IWOC - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/iwoc-endorses-national-prison-strike-and-pledges-support/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>,May 23, 2018</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/5-15-1068x654.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="196" align="right" />Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) announces its support for the national prison strike starting on August 21st, 2018.</span></h3>
<p>Whereas, trusted comrades, collectives, and networks behind the prison walls have convened, called for a &ldquo;National Prison Strike&rdquo; from August 21 to Sept 9, 2018, issued a set of demands and guidelines and requested outside support, (1)</p>
<p>Whereas, we, the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee of the IWW have heard their call for support and find the strike and its goals completely aligned with our material work and with all points of our Statement of Purpose (2),</p>
<p>Be it resolved, we endorse the strike, pledge our support and furthermore, embrace the work of solidarity.</p>
<p>We, as the national body of the IWOC network strongly encourage all outside branches and members-at-large to take on the support work to the utmost of their capacity and according to their best judgement.</p>
<p>As the strike develops, the scope of of work will also develop and will need further guidelines and ratification, so we offer this motion as a framework and a beginning. Further motions to amend are entertained as the work demands and teaches. The areas of work appropriate to our network, as we see them now, are as listed below:</p>
<p>1. Immediately add our name to the list of endorsing organizations and solicit other organizations to endorse and support.</p>
<p>2. Spread the word of the strike and demands inside as best and responsibly as we can so that our inside members and contacts can make informed decisions as to their positions and possible actions.</p>
<p>3. Media</p>
<p>a. National Media Committee: assist and coordinate with the Jailhouse Lawyers Speak/Millions for Prisoners media representatives according to their protocols in fielding and fulfilling media requests, strategizing, spreading social media, and assisting in generating original works in all available mediums.</p>
<p>b. Locals: generate, share and publish educational and agitational material in all available mediums.</p>
<p>c. Make available whatever vetted media representatives we can muster regionally and nationally to speak on the strike to groups or to media outlets (according to the prisoners&rsquo; protocols for media requests).</p>
<p>4. Anti-repression</p>
<p>a. To immediately begin building networks of outside supporters committed to phone blasts, demonstrations, and pressure campaigns of any type to combat repression and retaliation against prisoners. Repression is already underway and prisoner groups are already making requests for support.</p>
<p>b. Educate all IWOC members and groups, all other support groups and public at large on the tactics and depth of retaliations undertaken against prisoners.</p>
<p>5. Local demands: Outside IWOC groups can aid prisoners in their area in adding their own demands to local strike messaging. Such addition has been approved by existing inside strike leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Let the work begin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For solidarity over the walls and wire,</strong></p>
<p><strong>For a world without prisons,</strong></p>
<p><strong>For liberation!</strong></p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>A statement from the North American IWW General Executive Board<img src="../sites/default/files/images/static1.squarespace.5911dc9e45b46_0.jpg" width="640" height="427" align="right" alt="" /></em></p>
<p class="rteleft">Comrades,</p>
<p class="rteleft">For over a year, the US has been pressing felony charges--including &ldquo;riot,&rdquo; &ldquo;inciting a riot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;conspiracy to riot&rdquo;--against protesters who were arrested at the inauguration of Donald Trump. After a revelation that they had been withholding evidence from the defense, federal prosecutors dropped all charges against 10 defendants last week, including against members of our union. Today, the second J20 trial ended in a mistrial for three defendants and full acquittal for a fourth.</p>
<p class="rteleft">The state is reeling from this defeat, and lashing out like a wounded animal as it retreats. 44 defendants are still awaiting trial. The hour is late; the time to act in their defense is now. <strong>We are calling for an international day of action in solidarity with the J20 defendants on Monday, June 25th.</strong></p>
<p class="rteleft">From the beginning, the J20 case has represented an escalation of the state&rsquo;s attempts to criminalize revolutionary politics. The Riot Act is an archaic law with a racist history, once used to repress and attack the black liberation movement in the US, which has not been used in Washington, DC since the Matthews case of 1968. Its application against protesters today signals the beginning of a wave of state repression comparable to the Red Scares of the 1920&rsquo;s and 1950&rsquo;s. Despite not even being present on Inauguration Day, an IWW member had his door kicked in and his house raided by police, before being slapped with the same charges as other protesters. We live in an era when fascists and white supremacists can attack us in the streets without legal consequence, but antifascists face over 60 years in prison for a demonstration.</p>
<p class="rteleft">If you live in the US, organize a demonstration outside your local DOJ building. If you live in another country, organize a picket of a US embassy. Call a 1-day solidarity strike at your workplace. Do whatever you can to raise the profile of our courageous comrades who are facing down the forces of reaction. The more scandal an action produces, the better.</p>

<p class="rteleft">Compa&ntilde;eros y compa&ntilde;eras</p>
<p class="rteleft">Hace m&aacute;s de un a&ntilde;o que el Estado acus&oacute; a los manifestantes arrestados durante la inauguraci&oacute;n de Donald Trump de provocar &ldquo;disturbios&rdquo;. La semana pasada, la fiscal retir&oacute; las acusaciones contra 10 de los procesados en el juicio en curso del J20 (20 de enero), incluidos miembros de la IWW. Esa victoria se logr&oacute; al mismo tiempo que se revelaba que la fiscal hab&iacute;a ocultado pruebas a la defensa deliberadamente. Hoy, el segundo juicio de J20 termin&oacute; con juicio nulo para tres de los acusados y absoluci&oacute;n completa del cuarto.</p>
<p class="rteleft">El Estado se tambalea con su derrota, y ataca como un animal herido a la vez que se retira. 44 acusados est&aacute;n todav&iacute;a a la espera de juicio. Ya es hora de actuar en su defensa. <strong>Convocamos un d&iacute;a internacional de acci&oacute;n solidaria con los acusados para el lunes, 25 de junio.</strong></p>
<p class="rteleft">Desde el comienzo, el juicio del J20 (20 de enero) ha sido un intento descarado de criminalizar las ideas revolucionarias. La ley vigente, la llamada &quot;Riot Act&quot; arrastra una historia racista. Fue usada para reprimir y atacar al Movimiento de Liberaci&oacute;n Negra. La &uacute;ltima vez que se utiliz&oacute; en Washington, DC, fue en el caso Matthews en 1968. Su uso actual contra manifestantes se&ntilde;ala el comienzo de una oleada represiva que se puede comparar con las histerias anticomunistas de los a&ntilde;os 20 y 50. Un miembro de la IWW fue objeto de un registro en su domicilio, en el cual la polic&iacute;a derrib&oacute; su puerta, antes de ser incluido en el mismo proceso. Sin embargo, ni siquiera hab&iacute;a estado presente en el d&iacute;a de la inauguraci&oacute;n. Vivimos en una &eacute;poca en la cual los fascistas nos pueden atacar en la calle sin consecuencias, pero en la que los antifascistas se enfrentan a m&aacute;s de 60 a&ntilde;os de c&aacute;rcel por una manifestaci&oacute;n.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Si vives en EEUU, organiza una manifestaci&oacute;n frente al edificio local del Departamento de &quot;Justicia&quot;. Si vives en otro pa&iacute;s, organiza un piquete en la embajada o consulado estadounidense. Convoca una huelga solidaria de 24 horas en tu centro de trabajo. Haz lo que puedas para dar a conocer el caso de nuestros valientes compa&ntilde;eros y compa&ntilde;eras, que se enfrentan a las fuerzas de la reacci&oacute;n. Cuanta m&aacute;s repercusi&oacute;n tenga una acci&oacute;n, mejor.</p>
