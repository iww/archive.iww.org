</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 12/02/2010 - 4:13pm</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/photos/color/events/HPIM1778/" align="right" /><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - December 2, 2010</b></p>
<p>12/2/2010 The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies) has officially voted to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement in support of Palestinian rights. The “Resolution in Support of the Workers of Palestine/Israel” was adopted in an overwhelming vote both at the IWW’s convention in Minneapolis and by the membership via referendum. This vote makes the IWW the first union in the US and the third union in Canada to officially support the Palestinian United Call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.</p>
<p>Inspired by the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, the BDS movement calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel until such time as fundamental Palestinian rights are recognized. The BDS call is supported by a broad cross-section of Palestinian society, including Palestinian unions.</p>
<p>The resolution to support the BDS campaign comes out of the work of the IWW’s International Solidarity Commission and the IWW Friends of Palestinian Workers Group, a grassroots network of Wobblies supportive of the Palestinian, Israeli and international struggle against Israeli apartheid. Support for the BDS campaign was also stressed by all the Palestinian workers who met with members of the IWW on the IWW delegation to Palestine, particularly the Independent Workers Federation of Palestine, with whom the IWW shares a close bond of solidarity.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p><b>The government won’t do it. CEOs won’t do it. Only working people can build a better future</b></p>
<p><a href="https://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2010/11/113198.html" target="_blank">By By Stephanie Basile - New York City Indymedia, November 25, 2010</a></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU660/sbux/d2_iww_banner_at_protest.jpgmid.jpg" align="right" />Every Thanksgiving I remind my friends and family of the deadly war waged against Native Americans in this country. This Thanksgiving, there is another war I’d like to discuss: the war being waged against retail workers.</p>
<p>This year I call on progressives to not only speak up for native people, but to remind our friends and family how important it is that workers have the right to organize for better conditions at work. And there’s no better time to discuss this than Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year.</p>
<center><p>A CULTURE OF NEGLIGENCE</p></center>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently sent letters to 14 major retailers urging them to adopt crowd control measures this Black Friday.</p>
<p>It would almost sound serious if one had no idea how impotent OSHA is and how powerful the big box retailers are. Yes, I’m sure OSHA’s “strongly worded letter” has CEOs shaking in their booties!</p>
<p>In fact, it would be downright comical if it wasn’t for the fact that lives have literally been lost because of retailers’ utter disregard for their employees’ and customers’ safety.</p>
<p>We all remember the tragic story: Two years ago 34-year-old Jdimytai Damour, a temporary Wal-Mart maintenance worker, was trampled to death and four were injured at a Long Island Wal-Mart on Black Friday.</p>
<p>The bloggers and commentators used the event to lament just how crazy our consumer culture has become. While it’s tempting to comment on our frenzied consumer culture, the crowd basically did what any large crowd would do. News reports described a crowd of at least 200 people waiting outside one set of doors for the store’s 5am opening. Predictably, when the store opened, people bum rushed the entrance. And when 200+ eager customers are waiting to enter one set of doors at five o’clock in the morning on Black Friday, it’s going to be difficult, to say the least.</p>
<p>What’s amazing about this situation isn’t how the customers acted, but that they bore the brunt of the blame for what is gross negligence on the part of Wal-Mart. In any other situation, the company surely would have been to blame. When crowds get out of control at football games or rock concerts, the venue is immediately held to account. Where was security? Why wasn’t there better crowd control? Why weren’t safety measures properly enforced? We should expect no less of retailers expecting large crowds on Black Friday.</p> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../node/5279/" title="Read the rest of Black Friday and the importance of having a voice on the job.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../graphics/IU460/NYCmisc/flaum-080510.jpg" />A Williamsburg kosher food company is locked in a battle with former workers who charge they were stiffed out of overtime pay - and then fired when they complained.</p>
<p>National Labor Relations Board investigators found that Flaum Appetizing Corp. illegally booted the workers, and ordered the company to cough up around $260,000 in back pay. But owner Moshe Grunhut has refused to comply - saying he won't pay the workers because they're undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The fired employees said they spent years working as much as 80 hours a week for minimum wage with no overtime, for bosses who often peppered them with verbal abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;I worked 11 years for that company and I never received a dollar of overtime or one holiday or one sick day, nothing,&quot; said Gustino Romero, 32, of Bushwick. &quot;I worked from 7 in the morning until 10 or 11 at night. ... We always asked for [overtime], but they said no.&quot;</p>
<p>Maria Corona, 36, of Williamsburg, said frequent insults from her boss made the situation worse.</p>
<p>&quot;The manager called us cockroaches, tarantulas, all kinds of offensive names,&quot; she said. &quot;The truth is we were unfairly exploited.&quot;</p>
<p>When the workers tried to form a union and went on a brief strike in 2008, management ordered them off the Flaum premises - a move the National Labor Relations Board ruled was illegal retaliation.</p>
