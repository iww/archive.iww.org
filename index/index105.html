</h2>

27 miners missing after New Zealand explosion<br />
By the CNN Wire Staff<br />
November 19, 2010 -- Updated 0829 GMT (1629 HKT)<br /><br />
(CNN) -- Twenty-seven miners were missing hours after an underground explosion on New Zealand's west coast, company officials said Friday.<br /><br />
Two other miners had emerged from the the Pike River coal mine in Atarau, authorities said.<br /><br />
About three hours after the blast, police said no fatalities had been reported. Emergency workers were going into the mine, TV New Zealand said.<br /><br />
The two miners who had surfaced arrived at the Grey Base Hospital, an hour away, with non-life-threatening injuries, TV New Zealand said. They had moderate blast injuries, with one being treated in the emergency room and the other in a ward.<br /><br />
Emergency crews had interviewed the two miners, trying to determine what happened. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, police said.<br /><br />
According to early accounts, an electrician went into the mine to investigate a power outage and discovered a driver who had been blown off his loader about 1,500 meters [0.9 mile] into the mine shaft.<br /><br />
A special mine rescue team was among the many emergency workers on the scene.<br /><br. A large group of family and friends of the miners had started gathering at the mine, TV New Zealand reported.<br><Br />
Communications underground were "terminated" when the explosion happened, Pike River CEO Peter Whittall said.<br /><br />
The entrance to the mine is about 2.2 kilometers along and then branches out, police said. The power outage might have compromised ventilation inside the mine.<br /><br />
Smoke hung outside the mine, trees were charred and a hut had been blown off a hill, TV New Zealand said.<br /><br />
There are two routes out of the mine, Whittall said. Unlike the Chilean mine where 33 miners were rescued in mid-October, the Pike River mine has steep terrain, and the shafts run horizontally into the hill, not vertically into the ground, he told TV New Zealand.<br /><br />
The remote mine is about 50 kilometers [31 miles] northeast of Greymouth, police said.</br.> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_3 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-200-mining-and-minerals/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for Department 200 - Mining and Minerals.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/18/2010 - 2:39pm</p>
<p><b>Employees that Work on Dr. King's Holiday will Receive Time-and-One-Half Holiday Pay</b></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU660/sbux/memphis_king.jpg" align="right" />November 18, 2010 - Contact: Aaron Kocher, 612-220-6454</p>
<p>New York, NY- Starbucks baristas across the United States for the first time next year will begin receiving a time-and-one-half holiday premium for working on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The move comes after a spirited three-year initiative of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) which made public the company's second-class treatment of Dr. King's birthday and called on the coffee giant to pay the same premium that it pays workers on six other federal holidays. After Starbucks refused to change its policy, union workers and their supporters launched a determined campaign of grassroots actions in Starbucks stores and communities all across the country in support of equal treatment for MLK Day.</p>
<p>Starbucks Union members say this is an especially emotional victory, given that the SWU has long-cited the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a major inspiration. Dr. King, who was assassinated in Memphis while supporting the effort of striking sanitation workers to form a union, was a staunch and outspoken defender of workers' rights including the right to a living wage and the right to join a labor union.</p>
<p>"We're deeply moved to have been able in our modest way to increase respect for Dr. King's legacy while ensuring that Starbucks employees who work on his holiday are fairly compensated," said Anja Witek, a Starbucks barista and SWU member in Minnesota. "This is a great example of what baristas and all low-wage workers can achieve by getting organized and taking direct action in support of workplace justice issues."</p>
<p>While Starbucks claims to 'embrace diversity', it doggedly resisted the SWU's call for equal treatment of MLK Day for three years. The company based its refusal on the claim that its holiday policy was in line with the (abysmally low) standards of the food service sector. The SWU made the case that Starbucks' commitment to diversity was illusory, citing the disproportionate number of workers of color in the lowest-paid positions in the company and its intense exploitation of coffee farmers including the Ethiopian workers who grew some of Starbucks' most expensive beans but received just 2.2% of the retail price.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p>Dear City &amp; Monroe Park Advisory Councils,</p>
<p>“There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people,” states the beginning of our labor union’s preamble. We, the Richmond members of the Industrial Workers of the World, feel that the renovation plans for Monroe Park, as they currently stand, will serve to exacerbate hunger and want in Richmond. We, as concerned citizens of the Richmond area and hardened activists and organizers, will not let this issue slip by without a struggle.</p>
<p>These renovation plans include fencing off the entire park for several months, and up to a year, denying access to all who depend on it, including the services provided there. This translates to the homeless being forced out of the park and dispersed into the VCU and Greater Richmond community, without concern for where they might await refuge in otherwise nearby shelters or sustenance via various meal programs that congregate there.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 10/30/2010 - 11:29pm</p>
<p>Jimmy Johns Workers Union (Industrial Workers of the World)
Contact: Emily Pzybylski, 414-477-9803.</p>
<p>October 22, 2010 - <b>Sandwich Workers to Continue to Press for Improved Working Conditions.</b></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/jjworkers1sm.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS – The Jimmy John's Workers Union has filed a 12-page Objection to the October 22 NLRB election at 10 Minneapolis sandwich shops, outlining a pattern of pervasive and systemic labor rights violations that prevented the possibility of a free and fair vote. The union election, a first in fast food in the US, was as close as they come, with 85 votes in favor of the union, 87 against, and 2 challenged ballots.</p>
<p>"Franchise owner Mike Mulligan decided to go beyond the pale. His managers asked workers to wear anti-union pins, fired pro-union workers, threatened a mass firing, implemented an illegal wage freeze, tightened policies and retaliated against union members, offered bribes, and pressured workers to vote no. He broke the law repeatedly in order to win, and he just barely won. That's not right. We are calling on the NLRB to set aside the results of this election," said worker and union member Emily Przybylsky.</p>
<p>In response to his employee's union campaign, franchise owner Mike Mulligan hired a third-party anti-union consulting firm, Labor Relations Inc., to prevent employees from winning an NLRB Union election. According to documents obtained from the Department of Labor, Mulligan spent over $84,500 on an anti-union campaign intended to prevent workers from unionizing.</p>
<p>Tim Louris, of Minneapolis labor firm Miller O'Brien Cummins, is assisting the union pro-bono in navigating the tricky waters of labor law. Union spokespeople say the written objection to the election results will be available to the public within a few days.</p>
<p>While filing with the NLRB to have the election results nullified, the workers also plan to mount a campaign to win their demands without union recognition.</p>
<p>"85 yes votes, in spite of 6 weeks of vicious union-busting, is a mandate for change," said "There are a thousand ways we can put pressure on Jimmy John's to win our demands for fair wages, sick days, consistent hours, and respect. We're fired up, this fight is just beginning," said Ayo Collins, another worker and union member.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is the first fast food union in the nation, and is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.</p>
