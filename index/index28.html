</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 11/30/2015 - 9:03pm</p>
<p><i><b>We prepared this short piece after several comrades were&nbsp;badjacketed&nbsp;in public and with pictures on social media at the 4th Precinct Shutdown.</b>&nbsp;We believe those individual cases have been dealt with, and don&rsquo;t wish to cause unnecessary division by complaining, or publicly calling any group or individual out. Instead,&nbsp;<b>this is intended to provoke reflection</b>, and conversation, amongst all of us, as to how to deal with the suspicions we may have of people we don&rsquo;t know in our growing movements, without creating the sorts of divisions among ourselves that does the work of the State and the police for them. We intend to act in solidarity with those who know how to act in solidarity.</i><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><i>We ask that all organizations and groups working for a better world in which we have killed White Supremacy, Capitalism, and all other forms of oppression, consider that (1) none of us represent the mandate of all the people, (2) that we may have instead genuine and important strategic and tactical differences between ourselves about the best ways to accomplish that world, (3) that&nbsp;<b>we will not win by pretending these differences do not exist, or dictating against difference, but instead by engaging on these differences in the most democratic and least hierarchical ways&nbsp;possible.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Therefore, we ask that groups and individuals read this document against the practice ofbadjacketing, discuss it, and consider publicly endorsing here that we will refrain from the practices of&nbsp;badjacketing.</b>&nbsp;This is not a call to be lax about security; indeed, many of us have been very involved in the provision of security at the Fourth Precinct. Instead, it is a call to be democratic and accountable about our security practices.&nbsp;<b>Please indicate your endorsement in the comments below.</b></i></p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-26 at 2.52.04 PM" src="https://twincitiesgdcdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-26-at-2-52-04-pm.jpeg?w=660" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party, and Anna Mae Aquash of AIM.</em></p>
<p>Every time people organize for liberation, autonomy, and a better world, the state and the bosses try to crush our movements. They don&rsquo;t particularly care how they do it, but they don&rsquo;t want to work hard. It&rsquo;s easier for them, if we do it for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can do this by misportraying us in the media, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sowing distrust and division within or between movements, and they do.</li>
<li>They can do this by harassing our people and preventing them from getting jobs, or demoralizing them with constant police contact, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by sending infiltrators into our groups, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by encouraging fascist groups to attack us, and they do.</li>
<li>They do this by directly and openly attacking us with police, and they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps the easiest and most effective thing they can do to neutralize and destroy our movements for liberation is to encourage us to act paranoid and to refuse each other&rsquo;s solidarity. One of the most effective techniques for this is called&nbsp;<b><span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;</b>(aka &lsquo;snitchjacketing,&rsquo; &lsquo;badjacketing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad-rapping&rsquo;), and it&rsquo;s when one of our own (or a paid infiltrator) accuses others without cause or evidence of being a infiltrator, threat, or security risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>BADJACKETING:&nbsp;</b>creating suspicion, by spreading rumors or unsubstantiated accusations, that people are undercovers, infiltrators, snitches, or cooperators. Sometimes this is done out of fear and paranoia. But normally, those who &lsquo;lay jackets&rsquo; on others want to consolidate their control over a movement and feel threatened in their authority. It&rsquo;s a favorite tactic of the State in destroying movements of liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tactics of the state and the police go together, and&nbsp;<span class="il">jacketing</span>&nbsp;often leads to direct violence and the destruction of movements. If you&rsquo;re still reading, let&rsquo;s take a look at two well known regional cases: the State assassination of Illinois Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark Clark (1969), and the murder of American Indian Movement militant and Anna Mae Aquash (Mi&rsquo;kmaq) (1975).</p>

<p><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/three_fist.jpg" alt="" />The General Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the World declares solidarity with the people standing up to the police state in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Black lives absolutely matter.</p>
<p>Standing up to the oppressive, murderous, and racist police occupation in north Minneapolis is just and we support it.</p>
<p>We stand in solidarity with everyone who stands up against oppression, and the racist violence of the police against people of color.</p>
<p>We pledge our solidarity with this struggle for justice and change that goes beyond reform. We pledge our solidarity with the people in north Minneapolis who deserve to live their lives without fear of being murdered by the police because of their economic status, where they live, or color of skin.</p>
<p>We stand in solidarity with protesters at the 4th Police precinct in north Minneapolis and stand in solidarity with the occupation until there is justice for Jamar Clark and the police are no longer a racist, classist, occupying army in north Minneapolis.</p>
<p>In solidarity and for total liberation,<br />

<a href="../content/what%e2%80%99s-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-solidarity-demo/" rel="bookmark">What’s outrageous? Unpaid wages! Report from solidarity demo</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/19/2015 - 5:38pm</p>
<p><strong>By Communications Officer - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/" target="_blank">Bristol IWW</a>, November 14, 2015</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/DSCN1107-300x225.jpg" alt="" />Fellow Wobblies and supporters, Bristol Communications Officer here to report on the wet but very successful solidarity demo held this morning in Bristol outside Cafe Amore!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We organised the demo in solidarity with Fellow Worker Bonny, who worked at Cafe Amore for a while and was not paid the full wages she was owed after quitting. Bristol IWW union representative assisted her in writing a demand letter to the cafe&rsquo;s boss, which Bonny then delivered by hand a week ago accompanied by fellow Wobblies. During the week, the boss paid her some of the money she was owed but not all of it, and didn&rsquo;t provide a clear explanation as to why he couldn&rsquo;t pay the whole amount, and when he would do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So, on we went this Saturday to hold a solidarity demo demanding the cafe&rsquo;s boss to pay Bonny her wages, as well as to highlight the bad practices that Cafe Amore use on their staff &ndash; unpaid trials, underpaying migrant staff, and forced unpaid overtime. </strong>Despite the relentless rain, we had a very successful demonstration attended by around 30 people, with many members and supporters of the IWW, and members of Bristol SolNet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before the start of the demo, Bonny went in the cafe accompanied by her union rep and other members of the IWW to renew her demand and hand out flyers to customers. The boss was very aggressive towards them, making excuses as to why he hadn&rsquo;t been able to pay Bonny&rsquo;s full wages, and being very vague as to when he would pay her the remaining amount. He then went on to tell another IWW member who was trying to talk to customers to &ldquo;get out of here or I&rsquo;ll beat you up&rdquo; in front of all the customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We stood outside the cafe for an hour, handing out flyers and singing songs in support of Bonny, and having lots of fun Wobbly-style! Lots of passers-by stopped to ask us what was going on and expressed interest and support for Bonny and what we were doing. But, Cafe Amore&rsquo;s boss still hasn&rsquo;t paid Bonny all the money she&rsquo;s owed! Bristol IWW will carry on holding weekly solidarity demos outside Cafe Amore until Bonny&rsquo;s paid up all the money she&rsquo;s owed. <strong>Keep checking our blog and, especially, our Facebook page and Twitter feed (links on the right) and, if Bonny still doesn&rsquo;t get paid, see you on Saturday 21 November at 12pm outside Cafe Amore</strong> (which is on Nelson Street, next to Holland &amp; Barrett). Or, as we put it today in our chants: Pay Bonny her money and we&rsquo;ll go away / Pay Bonny her money or we&rsquo;re here to stay!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Do you also work in the bar &amp; hospitality sector &ndash; bars, pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, catering, etc? Does any of this sound familiar to you? The IWW has just launched a campaign to support and organise workers in these businesses. You can read our statement here:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/iww-bar-hospitality-workers-campaign/"> statement</a>.</strong> <strong>We have also written an article on local paper &ldquo;The Bristol Cable&rdquo; highlighting the issues of bar &amp; hospitality workers in Bristol. You can read it here:<a target="_blank" href="http://thebristolcable.org/2015/11/is-your-waiter-fair-trade-and-ethically-sourced/#"> article.</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>If Bonny&rsquo;s situation sounds familiar to you, and you need help and support to stand up to bully bosses who don&rsquo;t pay wages and treat their workers like doormats, email us at <em>bristol@iww.org.uk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are a grassroots union that uses direct action methods to support workers to fight back for their rights. This is what we can offer you: training to know Employment Law and (where possible) use it to get what you want; training to represent your Fellow Workers in grievance and disciplinary meetings; training to organise your co-workers so you can speak as one voice, and get more influence over what goes on at work; and, finally, TRAINING TO WIN &ndash; better terms and conditions, better pay, and less bullying from your boss!</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 11/19/2015 - 5:28pm</p>
<p><strong>By Phinneas Gage - <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/11/06/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-iii/">Recomposition</a>, November 6, 2015</strong></p>
<p><i><img width="320" height="238" align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/foodservwork_1.jpg" />This is the third part of a series of concrete examples (<a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/08/27/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-i/" class="bb-url">Part I</a> &ndash; <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2015/10/08/concrete-examples-of-non-labour-relations-board-unions-part-ii/" class="bb-url">Part II</a>) and very brief summaries of organizations that have some component of direct action and a form of collective bargaining that operate outside the labour relations framework. The following examples are from the IWWs organising efforts in food service. This includes fast food as well as grocery stores in a lot of the examples the IWW actually engaged in innovative organising that broke ground in more high profile campaigns like the well known &ldquo;Fight for Fifteen&rdquo; campaigns around raising the minimum wage in the USA. </i></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight:bold">4. The IWW in Food Service</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">a). The Jimmy John&rsquo;s Workers Union</span></p>
<p>The Jimmy John&rsquo;s Workers Union started as an effort by the Twin Cities General Membership Branch of the IWW to organise in Fast Food. The campaign at it&rsquo;s height had shop committees in multiple shops and a city wide committee. Ultimately, the campaign made a decision to go for an NLRB election and only failed by two votes with 85 in favour and 87 against. After that point the campaign went into steep decline but the organisers still managed to create an impressive track record of gains for themselves and their co-workers including: reversing decisions by management to fire people, addressing health and safety concerns for delivery drivers, tips jars, a city wide pay raise, and scheduling issues as well as countless smaller individual grievances in their shops. There is still an underground IWW presence in many shops across the USA and a very public campaign in Baltimore.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Advantages</span>: Large numbers of workers mobilised. A city wide organisation spanning at all ten shops in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota) at its height. Coordination through city wide mass meetings. The media work on this campaign was impressive including making the <span style="font-style:italic">New York Times</span>. Impressive gains before, during, and after the failed certification election.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Disadvantages</span>: Campaign wasn&rsquo;t merely oriented towards a youth counter culture, it celebrated it and was itself a function of it. Substance abuse on the campaign was a major issue and led to key organisers putting their jobs at risk and getting injured unnecessarily. Logistically it was very lax with campaign data, mostly being kept in the personal notebooks of key organisers. Many organisers were also goal oriented to the point of certification becoming an all or nothing proposition and the campaign slowly contracted as key people moved on to other projects after the certification campaign failed, despite efforts to downplay the legal process by some organisers. As well the ability to join the JJWU campaign but not the IWW also created a tiered membership that made it ambiguous as to who was actually a member and difficult to consolidate membership beyond just the shop. Ultimately failed to bridge some of the demographic divides in the industry.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">What happened?</span><br />
There is still an underground IWW presence in some shops across the USA and a very public campaign in Baltimore. After the certification election six key organisers were fired over a publicity stunt involving a fight for sick days and the NLRB process is now on its last appeal several years later. The campaign is an impressive achievement for an all volunteer union on a shoe string budget.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">b). The Starbucks Workers Union</span></p>
<p>Where the Jimmy John&rsquo;s Workers Union in the Twin Cities peaked at a failed certification election the Starbucks Workers Union really got going after a failed attempt at certification. In 2003 wobblies started organising at a Starbucks in Manhattan. In 2004 they tried for a union certification election. The National Labour Relations Board defined their bargaining unit as every Starbucks in Manhattan. which for an organising committee of only a handful became unfeasible as it would include hundreds of workers. So the campaign chose to continue outside of the recognition framework. Since that time over a decade ago the SWU has ran campaigns in dozens of cities going public in towns like New York, Chicago, Quebec, Minneapolis and Dallas. Countless underground committees have pushed back against management to rack up impressive wins like: changes to scheduling practices, enforcing the right to take bathroom breaks, winning a two dollar an hour raise for all Starbucks workers in New York, and improvements to health and safety. Perhaps their greatest achievement was winning Martin Luther King Day as a paid day off in the USA for all Starbucks workers, many of whom are African American. The union has also won countless small victories overturning discipline, fighting against sexual harassment and discrimination at work and extending international solidarity to Baristas in Chile. The union has made national press several times and has won several labour relations board rulings cementing some legal recourse to unions that exist outside the contract and certification process.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Advantages</span>: Extremely fluid organisation allowed for rapid expansion to other cities and shops without too much red tape. The campaign can coordinate demands over multiple cities and countries. Strong emphasis on direct action, the campaign has repeatedly avoided certification elections since the initial defeat in New York and has since developed a strong practice of shop floor unionism.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Disadvantages</span>: Like other IWW efforts in Fast Food the campaign suffers from a high turnover in their workforce and all the problems that come from that. The campaign was logistically lax at some points but fairly strong at others. Part of their very fluid structure made creating democratic structures and decision making difficult. The campaign also had a tendency to go public with a small minority in the shop. Part of this was due to a reliance, probably an over reliance, on media tactics. These strategic decisions put a tremendous amount of strain on key personalities and also create problems as far as giving credit to other people, creating an investment on the part of the less high profile activists, and bringing constant scrutiny and attention from management. Also when the Quebec wobblies joined the SWU from an already existing union formation things quickly fell apart due to differing emphases on direct action and a greater reliance on certification votes (which failed) in Canada. Ultimately the organisers quit en mass and called it direct action.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">What happened?</span><br />
The IWW still has organising activity at Starbucks stores all over North America and a public presence in New York that is going on twelve years this year.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 11/08/2015 - 2:56pm</p>
<p><strong>By Eric Dirnbach - <a href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/can-solidarity-unionism-save-labor-movement/" target="_blank">Waging Nonviolence</a>, November 4, 2015</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="510" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/SolidarityUnionismCoverLrg.jpg" alt="" />The debate on how to revive the troubled U.S. labor movement has been around for decades. Labor activists generally believe that much greater rank-and-file democracy and workplace militancy is the key to labor renewal. However, an essential perspective that is usually missing from the conversation is well represented by Staughton Lynd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism: Rebuilding the Labor Movement from Below,&rdquo; which was first published in 1992 and has been recently reissued.</p>
<p>Lynd is a legendary progressive lawyer and activist from Youngstown, Ohio. He is the coauthor with his wife Alice Lynd of the classic &ldquo;Rank and File: Personal Histories by Working-Class Organizers,&rdquo; a collection of oral histories of militant union organizers, which informs much of the framework of &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism.&rdquo; At around 100 pages, the book reads more like a summary of his organizing philosophy, and many readers will come away wanting a more extensive discussion. It should be read along with several other recent books which make similar arguments: Stanley Aronowitz&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2015/02/review-can-labor-save-itself" target="_blank">The Death and Life of American Labor: Toward a New Workers&rsquo; Movement</a>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2014/10/review-alt-labor-or-not-it-will-take-rank-and-file-power-revive-us" target="_blank">New Forms of Worker Organization: The Syndicalist and Autonomist Restoration of Class-Struggle Unionism</a>,&rdquo; edited by Immanuel Ness, who also provided the introduction for &ldquo;Solidarity Unionism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynd argues for a rethinking of the assumptions of the labor movement and for a revived version of labor organizing that was more prominent in the pre-New Deal era that he calls &ldquo;solidarity unionism.&rdquo; What may surprise most labor-oriented readers is that central to this kind of unionism is the absence of a contract between the union and the employer.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the whole point of forming a union to get a written collective bargaining agreement? Lynd doesn&rsquo;t think so and he argues that workers fighting together with direct action on the job to make improvements in the workplace do not need a contract and may be hurt by having one. He is critical of the &ldquo;management rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;no-strike&rdquo; clauses that are standard in almost all union contracts. He believes they reduce the power of workers to influence major decisions in how the workplace is run and to solve their problems at work immediately as they arise. Contracts tend to remove agency from the workers and place it in the hands of union staff who typically bargain and process grievances while the members may be uninvolved and cynical. Lynd is also skeptical of a union&rsquo;s exclusive representation of all workers in the workplace and automatic dues check-off, preferring for workers to actively join the union and pay dues because they want to.</p>
<p>Lynd&rsquo;s view of the prevailing &ldquo;contract unionism&rdquo; differs from standard labor history, which considers the 1935 <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a>, or NLRA, labor reforms as a progressive advance for workers. In the mainstream view, workers organizing, with the support of President Roosevelt, finally won full government enforcement for the right to organize and bargain collectively. In exercising this right, unions typically hold workplace elections and then negotiate contracts with employers that set the conditions of employment and also guarantee labor peace (no strike/no lockout) for the term of the contract. This industrial relations framework led the way for millions of workers to organize and improve their wages and working conditions. This &ldquo;class compromise&rdquo; held for several decades until employers changed their mind and increased their opposition to unionization again.</p>
