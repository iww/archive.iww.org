While Starbucks claims a commitment to racial diversity and pays a holiday premium on federal holidays including the Fourth of July and New Year&rsquo;s Day, baristas receive no added compensation for working through the MLK Day holiday.</p> <p>&ldquo;Dr. King is a hero to many baristas and it&rsquo;s only right that Starbucks- with its claimed commitment to diversity- treat his holiday with respect,&rdquo; said Liberte Locke, a member of the SWU. &ldquo;King stood up courageously for economic justice and no doubt would smile upon low-wage fast food workers taking home much needed extra money at the end of the day.&rdquo;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p><img border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU520/rrcover520.jpg" /><em>By Ron Kaminkow</em></p> <p>Rail Labor activists from across North America are coming together to form a new cross-craft inter-union caucus that include<strong>s</strong> all rail workers in North America. Membership is open to<strong> </strong>union members from all the various unions (once known as the &ldquo;brotherhoods&rdquo;) in this new organization. In addition, special efforts will be made to include Canadian and Mexican workers as well.</p> <p>To build this broad based unity and solidarity, the activists have launched Railroad Workers United (RWU). &ldquo;We want everyone to understand that we are not creating another rail union to compete with those already in existence&rdquo;, explains Jon Flanders, member of Machinists #1145 in Selkirk, NY. &ldquo;Instead, we are creating an industry-wide caucus where we can all come together to help each other build the solidarity, support, democracy and strength that is missing in our individual craft unions. Who knows what the potentials and possibilities could be for such an organization of all rail labor.&rdquo; </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_28 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-500-transportation-and-communicatio-0/" rel="tag" title="

The Industrial Workers of the World, which Utah is both a member and a important supporter of, is holding a benefit to help Utah continue to live a decent life, and to help defray his overwhelming medical bills.<br /><br />Utah is an American military veteran, rail-riding hobo, co-founder of the Joe Hill house, pacifist, former candidate for U.S. Senate (Utah), and former host of National Public Radio (NPR) program Loafer&rsquo;s Glory: The Hobo Jungle of the Mind.<br /><br />A major influence on American Folk Music, as well as on the culture of the modern American labor movement, he taught and inspired contemporary folk icons like Rosalie Sorrels, Kate Wolf, and Ani DiFranco, and his music has been covered by countless musicians.<br /><br />Utah has many Minnesota connections that make it particularly appropriate for this benefit to be held here: he used to play in the hobo jungles at Pig&rsquo;s Eye Landing, and in the Finnish Socialist Communes that played such an important role in the Minnesotan North.<br /><br />This is our humble attempt to help out someone who desperately needs our help, and to pay him back a little for his countless contributions to our lives and world. I sincerely hope all can come and help support Utah in his current difficulties.<br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_35 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/recreational-worke/" rel="tag" title="
