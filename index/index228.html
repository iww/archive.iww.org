<p><strong>By Melissa Meinzer - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/news/story.cfm?type=News%20Briefs#6445"><em>Pittsburgh City Paper</em>, July 20, 2006</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU460/EEFC/2_0005_co-opnews.jpg" />For many workers at the <strong>East End Food Co-op</strong>, the road to union recognition gets longer with every step they trudge. Although union supporters say a majority of workers have voted in favor of a union, the co-op is declining to recognize the election, in part because of a rival union effort begun by a former manager. And there is another source of controversy: the co-op&rsquo;s hiring of <strong>Braun Consulting</strong> &mdash; an organization seen by many employees as anti-union.</p><p>Workers at the <strong>Point Breeze</strong> natural foods outlet, who have been trying unsuccessfully to unionize for years, thought that their most recent push would be enough to have management recognize the <strong>Industrial Workers of the World</strong> as their union. They say that more than half of the 55-person staff signed union authorization cards between May 19<sup> </sup>and June 7. While members of the <strong>Workers Committee</strong>, the employee group heading up the IWW push, won&rsquo;t reveal just how many signed cards they have, committee member <strong>Evan Wolfson</strong> calls it &ldquo;a clear majority.&rdquo;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_244 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/pittsburgh-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Pittsburgh General Membership Branch.

<p><img border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU660/sbux/15912-216sm.jpg" />In the latest attempt to scare workers from joining the IWW Starbucks Workers Union, Starbucks has fired two union members in two different stores. Evan Winterscheidt, a 2 year employee at 14<sup>th</sup> st and 6<sup>th</sup> ave and Charles Fostrom at 57<sup>th</sup> st and Lexington ave. The Union demands the immediate reinstatement of both workers and an end to the illegal anti-union activities. </p> <p>The IWW Starbucks Workers Union believes that these two firings are part of an on going anti-union campaign and is filing more unfair labor practices against the company. Although Starbucks has relentlessly tried to intimidate NYC baristas from joining the union, workers continue to organize for higher wages, consistent hours, respect at work and a better life on and off the job. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
