<p>
Thursday March 4th was an exciting and invigorating day of action as students and education workers from around the State of California walked out of schools and universities in protest of impending cuts to education budgets statewide. Students and teachers protested against the cutbacks, attacks on unions, and even against the systematic privatization of public education.
</p>
<p>
On March 4th the IWW set up a literature table at Frank Ogawa Plaza just outside of city Hall in downtown Oakland, which was the gathering point for students and teachers in western Alameda County. Beginning at Noon, thousands of teachers and students began pouring into the plaza as organizers, activists, students, and teachers spoke out against the impending cuts. IWW members marched in several different contingents (and many active members of the Bay Area GMB are teachers).
</p>
<p>
Bay Area IWW buyback recyclers spoke out publicly against the cutbacks in solidartity with the students and teachers. The largest contingent to arrive in Ogawal plaza (and one of the last) was the 1,000-plus strong UC Berkeley contingent who marched over six miles from the Berkeley campus to downtown Oakland.
</p>
<p>
Some of the IWW members later took BART (public transit) across the bay to San Francisco to join in a rally at Civic Center Plaza organized by teachers and students in the city.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, some of the more militant activists made a bold stand by taking over a very busy Interstate 880 and 980 freeway interchange near Oakland's Jack London Square. It's not certain whether or not any of these activists were IWW members, several of the demonstrators were arrested (and one unlucky activist was injured by a fall from the above-ground freeway overpass to the street level below).&quot;

<a href="../node/5010/" rel="bookmark">“Springtime for America (Again)” - Bay Area IWW Participates in the March 4th Demonstrations</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 03/23/2010 - 2:06pm</p>
<p>

<strong>By John Reimann<br />
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Ronald Reagan ran for re-election for president in
1984, he declared that it was “springtime for America”. He should have said it
was “springtime for Corporate America.” Under his administration and those that
followed, Corporate America and the world wide capitalist class increased its
domination of the world, seemingly without an equivalent resistance from the
working class, especially from the US working class. While this has
started to change in recent years, the movement in the US has been
lagging far behind.
</p>
<p>
Now that is starting to change.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Youth Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
In California,
a college and university student movement started over the last six months. The
attacks on college and university students that have generated this movement
are part of wider attacks on public education as well as on all public services
and on the working class in general. Almost immediately, the university
students grasped the slogan “defend free public education” – making the link
between their own situation and that of public education in general. At a California state-wide
student conference last October, it was agreed to organize a state-wide strike
for March 4.
</p>
<p>
Here in the working class town of Oakland,
California,
an “Outreach Committee” was set up build the movement in this area. One key
issue was decided immediately: Our intent was to actually disrupt the workings
of the state, and we were going to try to do that through setting up a protest
starting at noon, rather than at the end of the work day. We also wanted this
to be an event of, by and for the youth of Oakland.
</p>
<p>
This contrasted to San
Francisco, where the union officialdom conspired with
the Board of Education to block a day-time rally. There, they organized a rally
for 5:00 p.m. to ensure that workers didn’t walk off work and students didn’t
walk out of school. Throughout the region, those forces who sought to tame the
movement pushed for attendance at this San Francisco
rally rather than the one in Oakland.
</p>
<p>
A key focus in Oakland
was to organize in the high schools. However, the size of our effort was
limited by the extreme constraints on our actual forces and resources. As a
result, in most schools we were unable to establish regular working groups to
organize a strike. Yet on March 4, by 7:30 in the morning, there were some 30
or 40 students standing outside the high school near my home, with home-made
picket signs in hand, shouting and cheering. <em>With just the minimal outside help, these students had organized
themselves!</em>

Kati Moore Inspires Starbucks District Managers to Expose High-Level Sexual Harassment<br />
<br />
Howard Schultz Still Silent Amid Growing Evidence of a Hostile Work Environment<br />
<br />
New York, NY- In a risky departure from the normal chain of command, a group of  Starbucks district managers have authored an impassioned letter to top executives in Seattle demanding that action be taken against a company vice president allegedly engaged in pervasive sexual harassment.  <br />
<br />
The letter, which was made available to the IWW Starbucks Workers Union, alleges that Regional Vice President Andrew Alfano has created an unsafe work environment with his behavior and is responsible for the departure of two female regional directors, among many other troubling charges.  <br />
