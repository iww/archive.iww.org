<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 01/18/2016 - 10:31pm</p>
<p><strong>By Coeur de Bord - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2016/01/17/15-at-ups-by-fw-coeur-de-bord/" target="_blank"><em>The Organizer</em></a>, January 17, 2016</strong></p>
<p>Eleven months ago, the Package Handler&rsquo;s Organizing Committee (PHOC) voted to begin a campaign demanding the starting wage at the three UPS hubs in the Twin Cities be raised to $15/hour (from the current $10), and a corresponding $5/hour raise for all hub employees. &nbsp;We had our sights set on building power towards some form of disruptive action during 2015&rsquo;s Peak Season. &nbsp;Now that Peak has arrived, I would like to share some of my feelings on the progression, evolution, and execution of this campaign, as well as some ways it has influenced our organizing in general at UPS in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I feel this document is useful as part of a future retrospective assessment of the Boxmart campaign and the PHOC committee itself. &nbsp;However, I hope it can also serve as a useful reference for other IWW organizing committees thinking about taking on labor-intensive, medium- to long-term campaigns such as this. &nbsp;Whether or not such a campaign would have a positive impact on your organizing is a decision that only your committee can make, but I hope that by offering my perspectives other Wobblies will be able to make a more informed decision.</p>
<h3><b>The motion </b><b><i>(original language)</i></b><b>:</b></h3>
<p><i>Notes 16/01/15</i></p>
<p><i>What: $5 hourly raise across the board, which would bring starting wage up to $15. Also, end petty wage theft and other shop floor issues where possible.</i></p>
<p><i>When: Major direct action during peak season 2015 aimed at entire Twin Cities operation. &nbsp;Smaller DAs before them, at moments to be determined. Campaign to start within two months (petitions coming out along with Screw ups at MPLS, Eagan, Maple Grove and airport).</i></p>
<p><i>Who: Petition to be drafted by core committee, Mass meeting to be run by &mdash;&mdash;, other tasks delegated to &mdash;, &mdash;- and &mdash; wherever possible to gather support from rest of branch. New shop floor contacts will be expected to further trenchwork on shop floor, canvass for issues to be addressed by escalating Direct Actions, and inoculation. OTC to arrange an OT soon after mass meeting for new contacts. Core committee (eg &mdash;&ndash;) to fill in gaps where people cannot attend a full OT. &nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Where: Meetings at TC IWW office, actions in MPLS, Eagan, Maple Grove and airport. &nbsp;Actions to focus on Minnesota operation unless tempting opportunities arise.</i></p>
<p><i>How:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i> Use petition to gather contacts for mass meeting. Create Facebook, etc contact points.</i></li>
<li><i> Use mass meeting to identify people willing and able to be organizers (and other roles) and set broad outlines of effort, changing as necessary to reflect workers&rsquo; concerns.</i></li>
<li><i> Follow up with potential organizers, get to OT where possible and patch with one-on-</i><i>ones where not. Create a campaign committee to broaden work, bring in smaller escalatable issues (eg petty wage theft, harassment etc), grow committee itself.</i></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><i> Do direct actions on smaller issues, symbolic stuff where appropriate. Include off-shop-floor issues eg prison slave labour ala hands up don&rsquo;t ship.</i></li>
<li><i> Follow up on retaliation for the above.</i></li>
<li><i> Bring smaller issues back in, build excitement and commitment and hold mass meetings in the months leading up to peak to organize peak action.</i></li>
<li><i> Mess everything up during peak.</i></li>
<li><i> Publicize concessions and workers&rsquo; eye view analysis of fight, follow up on retaliations.</i></li>
<li><i> Set further goals.</i></li>
</ol>

<p><b>By Phineas Gage - <a target="_blank" href="http://recomposition.info/2016/01/07/free-parking/"><em>Recomposition</em></a>, January 7, 2016</b></p>
<p><img width="320" height="222" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/freeParking_Photo3.jpg" alt="" />Ike and I walked into Sam&rsquo;s office at exactly ten in the morning. Not a minute before or after. We never talked to management, especially the Labour Relations guys, with less than a pair present. Sam ran the video on his computer screen for us to look at. It was a clip of a woman walking at night towards a door. She looks over her shoulder and a shadow glides towards her, she lunges for the door and struggles to open it with the key card. Then a leg that ends with a bicycle pedal and two wheels drifts into plain view and off camera. She opens the glass door and then slams the door behind her and leans on it, panting. The clip then looped and played over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, in the investigation, you told the sister that you think the union put her up to this?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>I was starting to feel a keen rage swelling up inside of me but I grabbed the arms of the chair tightly and tried to keep my cool.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s face was like cold stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too convenient. You guys start complaining about the health and  safety at the Transportation yard and all of a sudden someone almost gets &lsquo;attacked&rsquo; in the yard?&rdquo; He was doing the scare quotes with his fingers.</p>
<p>The video clip completed another loop.</p>
<p>I could feel my anger at the situation starting to effect my judgement. He was probably egging me on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is staged Sam. I mean, really, all things being equal, what is more likely: a confrontation with someone at night outside a downtown workstation or an elaborate conspiracy to put a show on for the cameras?&rdquo; I was smiling and trying to insert some humour into the situation.</p>
<p>The clip completed another loop.</p>
<p>I could feel a light stinging sensation on the back of my thighs as soon as Sam started to talk again. The hairs on my arms were starting to stand on end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at? This isn&rsquo;t funny. See, this is his problem, Ike, he doesn&rsquo;t take this stuff seriously.&rdquo; Sam was dripping with condescension. That and cologne.</p>
<p>I shot out of my chair, like a bullet, and leaned over his desk stuffing my index finger into the space in front of his chest. I could see Ike&rsquo;s eyes go wide as my one arm stretched out towards him, my index finger stopping just shy of his chest. &lsquo;Never, ever, touch them, Phineas, especially when angry&rsquo;, I told myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking lucky all I&rsquo;m doing is laughing, you dickhead. A woman almost got assaulted in your parking lot and your first response is to spin an insane conspiracy theory about performance art in front of surveillance cameras? What kind of piece of shit sociopath does that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I regained composure and looked at Ike.</p>
<p>Ike nodded and said, &ldquo;I think that is about as of thorough an exploration of the issues we are going to get today,&rdquo; He gently grabbed my arm and we walked out.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 12/28/2015 - 9:13pm</p>
<p><b>By anonymous - <a href="http://newsyndicalist.org/2015/12/24/no-one-strikes-harder-than-a-wobbly-dual-carder/" target="_blank"><em>New Syndicalist</em></a>, December 24, 2015</b></p>
<p><img width="320" height="251" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/OpenRedCard.jpg" alt="" />Like many IWW members in the UK I work in the public sector. Traditionally this has been an area of high trade union density particularly in teaching, the civil service and health. It is also one of the last bastions of collective bargaining power for the trade union movement. Although as the recent record of capitulation to austerity policies, cuts in pay and cuts in social services shows trade union density rarely equals trade union militancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dual carding&rdquo; &ndash; membership in a craft union alongside the IWW &ndash; is a relatively underdeveloped strategy for the UK. In spite of a reputation for &ldquo;minority unionism&rdquo; Wobblies have historically played animating roles in trade unions aside their commitment to building a combative and revolutionary alternative to craft union structures. The IWW, after all, was the product of an amalgamation of the most militant and advanced expressions of the trade union movement of the time.</p>
<p>In spite of this it would also be simplistic to say that membership in the IWW and activity in a broader trade union is fully harmonious. The IWW does ultimately exist as a criticism of the limitations of craft unionism and its reformist methods. Many leftists labour under the illusion that trade unions can be captured and turned towards revolutionary aims. In practice this has often meant running left leadership slates for union elections. A practice that is neither appealing to Wobblies nor has proved particularly successful in terms of shifting the actual activity of trade unions. An equally common approach is to stoke rank-and-file militancy at the branch level, either through the building of left caucuses or networks of militant reps. This seems like a more natural approach for a Wobbly to take promoting those qualities and methods that we see as valuable in syndicalist organising &ndash; militancy, activism from the roots, bottom-up over top-down etc.</p>
<p>Yet this approach also has its limitations. The structure and organisation of the trade unions can undercut struggles even at the rank-and-file level. Just like any experienced organiser should prepare strategies for dealing with a difficult and divisive boss, a dual-carder needs to anticipate and prepare for the possibility that trade union bureaucracies will undermine the work of militant organisers and remove them from a position of influence with the membership if they see them as troublesome or a threat. Our aims should also go beyond simply organising more militant and combative trade unions. We need to understand how our activities as trade unionists help to sow the seeds of workers&rsquo; control in our industries in addition to building links with those in unorganised sectors and supporting our fellow workers growing IWW campaigns.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to act as a representative for my local NUT (National Union of Teachers) branch, below are a number of observations developed from experimenting with this new role. My aim is that these offer a contribution to some of the issues that are raised above as part of a broader debate on dual-carding in the union:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Debunking the myth of the &ldquo;militant union rep&rdquo; &ndash; building a militant membership</strong></h3>
<p>It is a widespread view within trade union branches that it&rsquo;s reps who should do most of the leg-work. This perception is reinforced by the fact that the majority of union resources, communication and, most importantly, meetings with management happen exclusively through the rep. The result is that workmates will talk more or less favourably about &ldquo;bolshie reps&rdquo; who are capable/incapable of standing up to management on their behalf. This is a bottle-neck in collective strength that a boss can easily exploit to demobilise, distract or diffuse the activity of the union. Good reps need to send the message out that it&rsquo;s the membership that calls the shots and not them. A step towards building a new union culture on this basis is bringing workmates into these otherwise exclusive communication channels. Dual-carders should share rep guides and union resources, carefully minute meetings with management, show how issues raised have been actioned and insist that problems are raised collectively through regular branch meetings and not via private communication with the rep. Even in recognised workplaces workers need to be educated on the idea that the union is only as strong as its membership and a poorly organised union can easily fall into a forum of consultation with management or even be de-recognised.</p>
<h3><strong>2. The branch is not a social space &ndash; so make one.</strong></h3>
<p>Trade union branches are generally very poorly organised. This does create opportunities for dual-carders in terms of introducing more democratic and inclusive processes without much institutional resistance. But in the absence of such clear structures meetings can often just be collective moaning sessions that can be tiring and demobilising for those involved. It is, of course, important for people to blow off steam especially in stressful professions but this shouldn&rsquo;t come at the expense of collective action. So why not create alternative spaces to do that? In the North we have been experimenting with this kind of model for young professionals in teaching. Our &ldquo;Educators Underground&rdquo; group meets once a month with young education professionals across the city. We talk about stresses and emotional challenges we have had at work, discuss alternative educational theories and provide advice and support to each other going back to our union branches. This helps to fill gaps in the current trade union structure as well as making us feel like we are well supported by our fellow workers in the same sector.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Act collaboratively, reproduce yourself.</strong></h3>
<p>Any good organiser should aim to reproduce themselves and this is as true of a dual-carder as it is an organiser within an IWW campaign. By sheer coincidence when I stood for position of branch union rep another workmate also expressed interest in the role. Rather than run a competitive election I suggested that we could share the job. This turned out to be a beneficial move for both of us. I was grateful for the help and support my co-rep could offer in getting to grips with the new role. Having another perspective on the running of the branch was also really valuable. I was able to support them in areas where they were less experienced such as meeting with the boss for the first time. And together we were able to bring in more robust changes to how branch meetings were run by virtue of the extra pair of hands and added energy. We also had the bonus benefit of strength of numbers in our last meeting with management (myself, my co-rep and the outgoing rep outnumbering the head 3-1)! I&rsquo;m now convinced that this practice should be pushed in all areas where it is practical. It shares out valuable skills, makes sure that there are others to step up when you are unable to fully take on union responsibilities and further debunks the myth that the rep is the linchpin of the branch.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Act like OBU, even if you aren&rsquo;t one.</strong></h3>
<p>Most public sector workplaces will have multiple recognition deals with different sections of the workforce. Legal action across these divides is difficult (that&rsquo;s not to say that other forms of solidarity aren&rsquo;t both practical and desirable) but there is nothing stopping you acting as a single unit in terms of how you organise within that work site. Inviting reps from other trade unions on site to your branch meetings is a good first step towards building dialogue between different sections of the workforce. Individuals or groups from unorganised sections can likewise be sought out and invited, for example, agency or temporary staff. Ideally at a more advanced stage this could evolve into a forum for discussion and decision-making across the work site and present a natural springboard for cross-site solidarity and industrial action.</p>
<p>Within this it is similarly important to maintain a parallel structure of social contacts and connections with workmates that exist outside the official trade union role. If you get into a position where you need to call unofficial or unsanctioned industrial action the trade union will do everything in its power to halt it. It&rsquo;s important in this case to have a working knowledge of the social map of your workplace to ensure success irrespective of the existence of the trade union labels. If you have approached the role with the idea of organising the worker as well as the branch you should be able to call on the former when the latter comes under attack. In effect falling back on the strength of the red card when the blue/green/grey/yellow/white one has failed you.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 12/23/2015 - 9:42pm</p>
<p><b>By Keno Evol - <a href="http://tcorganizer.com/2015/12/22/4thprecinctshutdown-a-statement-on-magic-and-resistance/" target="_blank">Twin Cities IWW</a>, December 22, 2015<br />
</b></p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/keno-15.jpg" />Still there is magic. Throughout the days I&rsquo;ve spent at the 4th precinct, on that sacred, now spiritual road of Plymouth Avenue, I have seen what I&rsquo;ve imagined in my mind&rsquo;s eye for quite some time &ndash;&nbsp;a community blockade of resistance. I say sacred intentionally. Throughout black history the shedding of black blood has made things sacred. Consider the way we view voting. Often the argument is that it&rsquo;s necessary to vote, because there is blood on these ballots. The people who came before us suffered so we can show up to the booth. This is true, though I think the idea distorts and manipulates people&rsquo;s commitment to figuring out their own consciousness and defining for themselves what activism really is. It creates a sort of guilt complex around the trauma of our elders. I&rsquo;m thinking of <em>A letter to Maria </em>when June Jordan writes, <em>&ldquo;So voting, or the right to vote, was a goal, yes, but not an overriding objective, nor was it a strategy, nor was it a tactic. The overriding objective was freedom from American apartheid.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>I also say spirituality intentionally, though not in terms of organized religion. But in terms of organizing around a common suffering, an approach which lends itself to a certain otherworldliness taking place &ndash;&nbsp;in this case within North Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I would go as far as to say the entire nation is in a moment of magic. I say magic within two categories of the word. For white Americans, I mean it in the most exhaustingly literal of terms. A Black boy vanishes and white America has a moment of immediate awe! They can&rsquo;t believe it! Where did the black boy go? The cop, the magician in this ritual, knows what a person in his trade would know about fooling the audience. Tragically unsurprised, however, black people living in this country know where every mirror, every smoke canister and every trap door is placed. This is what I mean by magic centered in white America.</p>

<p><img width="250" height="250" align="left" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/cropped-cropped-middle-proper.jpg" />1<b>. </b><strong>You&rsquo;re having problems at your workplace.</strong><b> </b>You may not be getting your correct pay, or your correct sickness pay, or holiday entitlement, but you are unsure what to do because you haven&rsquo;t got anything written, or you do but it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to you and nobody has bothered to explain it to you.</p>
<p><strong>You want to do something about it,</strong> but you don&rsquo;t really know what your rights are and what the law says. You may be bullied, harassed or intimidated by colleagues and/or managers, and feel isolated and depressed. Or, perhaps, you may actually like your job, get on with your colleagues and not have any problems at all with it. You may be unemployed, or a student or a retired person. You may think you have nothing in common with people in different circumstances, but we think you do: <strong>we think you should all join the IWW</strong>. In the IWW we believe that whether you are in work or not right now, you are still part of a society based on paid work and as such you will be affected by it at some point or other.</p>
<p><strong>In the IWW we believe you don&rsquo;t join the union only when you have a problem</strong> that you need an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; to fix; we think you should join anyway because being in a grassroots union is a key element of being involved and engaged with the world you live in. We think everyone has the right to take control and power back over their lives and work. We think everyone has the right to learn about employment rights and legislation and <strong>become their own &ldquo;expert&rdquo;</strong>. We become &ldquo;experts&rdquo; through formal training courses in casework and organising, but mostly we learn informally, by sharing knowledge and skills and supporting each other. We are grassroots, we are democratic, and we are fighters.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fightingcat.jpeg"><img width="253" height="300" align="right" alt="fightingcat" src="../sites/default/files/fightingcat-253x300.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-402 alignright" /></a>2.<b> </b><strong>You are a member now</strong><b>,</b> and suddenly you do have problems in your workplace. Your manager may have decided to change your terms and conditions and demanded you to accept. You may notice you are not getting paid all the hours you are working. You may be under a lot of stress and pressure at work and have to take time off work sick because of it. <strong>Who you gonna call? The Wobblies!</strong> You arrange to meet with one of our caseworkers and go through things with them. You finally have someone to talk to who will listen to you and give you guidance and support, help you understand the law and what to do.</p>
<p><strong>In the IWW we believe in EMPOWERMENT not delegation: </strong>we don&rsquo;t do things FOR you, we do things WITH you. Once you have a clearer idea of the options available to you, it is up to you to decide what steps to take, knowing that the IWW will have your back. The IWW can help you in many different ways, from standard workplace procedures such as grievances and disciplinaries to more complex casework such as supporting you to take your case to an Employment Tribunal if appropriate. All these words and expression may mean nothing to you at the beginning, and you may feel overwhelmed by it all, but slowly, with the help of your IWW rep, you will become your own &ldquo;expert&rdquo;. You will start to understand, learn and feel empowered: <strong>knowledge is power.</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>So, your case is ongoing and we are following the standard procedures. </strong>We may be supporting to write formal demands to your employer, attending meetings alongside you, helping you to find a good solicitor, advocating on your behalf with your employer or other organisations (such as ACAS).</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes though things don&rsquo;t work,</strong> maybe because your employer is not responding, or because the nature of your employment is such that standard procedures are not appropriate. So, what happens then? Simple: we use direct action. <strong>We get together, because together we are stronger,</strong> and we get your case &ldquo;out there&rdquo;. We may ask people to call or write to your employer and complain about they way they are treating you. We may ask for a boycott of the company you are working for. We may get in touch with local and national press to publicise your case. We may hold a demonstration at your workplace until your employer meets your demands.</p>
<p>This is what we have done recently for one of our members who had her wages withheld by the cafe she worked at. And just in case you are wondering, <strong>yes, it did work:</strong> direct action does get the goods! <a href="http://www.bristoliww.org.uk/whats-outrageous-unpaid-wages-report-from-solidarity-demo/">Read our report about it &ldquo;What&rsquo;s outrageous? Unpaid wages!&rdquo;.</a></p>
<p>4.<strong> All is over now,</strong> your employer has seen sense and you are in the pub celebrating with the Wobblies and your friends. You will feel knackered. You will also feel thrilled, energised, inspired. You will look at yourself in the mirror and know you have had the guts to stand up for your rights, no matter how stressful it has been. You have learned that you are not alone, and you will never feel alone again when standing up to your boss because the IWW will always have your back. <strong>So, what next?</strong> Well, if you haven&rsquo;t already done so, you could complete our training courses in casework and organising. You will now have the knowledge and skills to support people in the same situation, and you will have a personal understanding of how it feels to have a dispute with your employer and WIN. <strong>The sky is our only limit, for us Wobblies! </strong></p>
