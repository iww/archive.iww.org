<p><img src="../graphics/photos/color/incidents/SVOBODA_502.jpg" height="167" width="251" align="right" />PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Superior Court Judge Joseph F. Rodgers Jr. Friday ordered a new trial for the woman accused of assaulting North Providence police officers during a protest in August 2007.</p>
<p>Rodgers ordered a new trial for Alexandra Svoboda on three counts of simple assault on the officers. Rodgers said he did not feel convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Svoboda had assaulted the officers by striking them with drumsticks during the protest, <a href="http://www.projo.com/news/content/NP_PROTESTER_CONVICTION_05-05-10_2QIBS4A_v34.41ba337.html" target="_blank">despite a jury's finding last week that she was guilty on all three counts</a>.</p>
<p>Rodgers did, however, let stand the jury's verdict that 25-year-old Svoboda had resisted arrest while picketing Jacky's Galaxie on Mineral Spring Avenue that hot August day.</p>
<p>Then the union secretary of the Industrial Workers of the World, Svoboda and others were protesting because the restaurant had purchased rice and takeout containers from a New York supply company accused of mistreating its employees. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_679 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/providence-iww/" rel="tag" title="">Providence IWW</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_553"><a href="../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/nyc-iu460/" rel="tag" title="NYC iu460">NYC iu460</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_23 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-400-manufacture-and-general-product-7/" rel="tag" title="

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 05/05/2010 - 2:39am</p>
<p>By John Jacobsen - <i>Fellow Worker Jacobsen is a labor activist currently living in Seattle, Washington. He works as a welder’s apprentice with the Boilermakers Local 104, and is an organizer with both the Seattle Solidarity Network and the Industrial Workers of the World. He has written and spoken on labor and anti-war topics to audiences from Seattle to Portland to London.</i> Originally Posted at <a href="https://thetbf.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/arizonas-immigration-law-and-mayday/" target="_blank">Trial by Fire</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/16/AzSB1070.pdf" target="_self">Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act</a> would require immigrants in the state of Arizona to carry their alien registration documents on their persons at all times. It also requires police to question any person they may reasonably suspect is in the U.S. illegally.</p>
<p>The Act comes after years of increased public outcry for better enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.</p>
<p>In response, grassroots organizations all over the country, from faith-based groups to labor unions, poured into the streets on May 1st to demand a repeal of the Arizona reforms.</p>
<p>May 1st, also known as International Workers&#8217; Day, has traditionally marked the anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_Massacre" target="_blank">Haymarket Massacre</a> in Chicago, 1886. But recently, the holiday has served as rallying point for labor activists and immigrant rights advocates to gather around.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Backlash &#8211; Mayday, 2010:</span></strong></p>
<p>In all, over 90 cities saw tens of thousands of protestors march, and a large number of high-profile politicians and celebrities speak out against the Arizona law.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AROZcIw0qio" target="_blank">this video</a>, you can see U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) being arrested for participating in an act of civil disobedience at the white house.</p>
<p>In another high-profile disagreement with Arizona, the Major League Baseball Players Association <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-zirin/this-is-racist-stuff-base_b_559738.html" target="_blank">released a statement</a> condemning SB1070.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20100502/D9FECDM00.html" target="_blank">Chicago</a>, between eight and fifteen thousand people gathered in support of immigrant rights only days after activists attempted to physically <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-illinois-immigration-anger2-20100427,0,7206749.story?obref=obinsite" target="_blank">block deportation vans</a> in their city. In Dallas, around 20,000 rallied.</p>
<p>Los Angelas saw by far the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/immigration/la-me-0502-immig-rally-20100502,0,5011733.story" target="_blank">largest protests</a>, massing about 50,000 marchers at its height, focusing predominantly on the Arizona reforms. Five coalitions, representing over 150 labor, faith, and immigrant rights organizations banded together to put out the call for the protests. Protestors in the march chanted &#8220;boycott Arizona,&#8221; and wore t-shirts asking &#8220;do I look illegal?&#8221;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
