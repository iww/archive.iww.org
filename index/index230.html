But Carey, a big, block-shouldered man with a reputation as both a polished salesman and a hard-line intimidator, didn&rsquo;t take Cudal&rsquo;s news well. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Cudal remembers him saying. &ldquo;What are you doing?

<p><img width="233" height="175" border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/IU630/Shattuck/DSC00143a.jpg" />BERKELEY 6:30 PM -- This afternoon workers at Landmark Shattuck Cinemas voted an outstanding 22 to 2 in favor of unionization. Despite new promises by Landmark and an attempt by CEO Bill Banowsky to thwart the union attempt, workers at the Shattuck say they've never really been worried about the vote.</p> <p>&quot;I've felt extremely confidant that the union would go through since the beginning.&quot; said Ryan Hatt, cinema employee age 21. &quot;Support has been almost unanimous since day one. There was no contest, if you would have asked me two months ago I could've guaranteed a landslide victory.&quot;</p> <p>Now that the vote has gone through, workers are looking ahead to the contract negotiation process. Contract negotiations at Kendall Square Cinemas in Cambridge, MA, the only other Landmark theatre to hold a union, have been moving extremely slowly with Landmark officials meeting only the bare minimum requirements to keep the negotiations process &quot;in good faith&quot; over the last year.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
