</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 05/30/2006 - 2:49am</p>
<p><em>This story was psoted after May 20th, so the tense doesn't agree with the date of the posting.&nbsp; We will bring more news about this campaign as it develops.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><img border="0" align="right" src="../graphics/agitators/modern/x351964/htruck3.jpg" />TORONTO &ndash; Members of the Toronto branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) are pleased to announce a recruitment drive in several targeted workplaces in the city&rsquo;s service and retail sectors. The IWW will kick off this campaign on May 20 with a public event at 18 Eastern Ave. (lower level), at 7 pm, featuring a presentation by Tomer Malchi. Malchi is involved in the union&rsquo;s highly publicized organizing initiative at Starbucks coffee shops in New York City. On May 21, Malchi will lead an organizing workshop for interested participants.<br /><br />The Cincinnati-headquartered IWW, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2005, is presently at its highest membership level since the 1940s, having recently enjoyed recruitment successes in, among other areas of the economy, New York food services and the California trucking industry. The union&rsquo;s Toronto branch was re-established in the summer of last year.<br /><br />While supportive of other trade unions, the IWW &ndash; informally known as the Wobblies &ndash; differs from mainstream organizations in its emphasis on rank-and-file initiative. IWW staff is minimal and dues paid by members are much lower than in other labour bodies.<br /><br />According to Toronto branch secretary Rachel Rosen, this approach is appropriate in an economy where low-wage positions with high turnover constitute much of the &ldquo;final frontier&rdquo; for organizers. In retail, she added, &ldquo;many workers can barely support themselves. They can&rsquo;t afford expensive dues. But they could use the assistance and solidarity of an organization that&rsquo;s been around for a long time. They need to come together to improve their wages and benefits in workplaces where employers clearly don&rsquo;t have their interests at heart.&rdquo;<br /><br />Young workers, according to Rosen, are also drawn to the IWW because of its alternative image, its commitment to a green, de-centralized economy and its standoffish approach to political parties.<br /><br />Aside from unorganized workers, the IWW also recruits the unemployed, students and dues-paying members of other unions (with no raiding intentions). The IWW &ldquo;organizes the worker and not the job&rdquo; and takes the view that those of its members who belong to other unions have a responsibility, in those organizations, to promote Wobbly values of grassroots democracy and militant action.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_592 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/toronto-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Toronto GMB">Toronto GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_38 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/general-distributi/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from General Distribution Workers Industrial Union 660.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 05/27/2006 - 2:35am</p>
<p><strong>A Campus Campaign for Starbucks Baristas and Coffee Farmers</strong></p> <p><img border="0" align="right" src="../graphics/IU660/sbux/starbuckslogo2.jpg" />Friends:</p> <p>This is a call for activists towards a campus campaign to achieve dignity on the job for Starbucks baristas and coffee farmers. </p> <p>Despite its attempt to create a socially responsible image, Starbucks' failure to meaningfully embrace Fair Trade coffee has left coffee farmers and their children teetering on the brink of starvation in the Global South. A new documentary, Black Gold (<a href="http://www.blackgoldmovie.com/">www.blackgoldmovie.com</a>), reveals in detail the pained existence of coffee farmers under the purchasing practices of Starbucks and other multinational corporations. </p> <p>In Starbucks cafes, baristas are paid a poverty wage and the company insures a lower percentage of employees than Wal-Mart. Starbucks baristas are organizing a union (<a href="http://www.starbucksunion.org/">www.starbucksunion.org</a>) with the Industrial Workers of the World for a better life on and off the job. In response, the company has waged a fierce and relentless anti-union campaign that tramples on workers' rights. In this union-busting operation unburdened by the law, Starbucks routinely retaliates against baristas for supporting the union. In addition, Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz recently broke the union of roasting plant employees.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_239 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/nyc-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our New York City General Membership Branch.
