</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 05/25/2017 - 7:05pm</p>
<p><strong>By the Portland IWW - <a href="http://portlandiww.org/2017/05/portland-may-day-2017-official-response/" target="_blank">Portland IWW</a>, May 4, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../sites/default/files/images/xPortland-LOGO.png.pagespeed.ic.eyvHj59-oJ/" align="right" alt="" />This was originally sent to KOIN 6 as a response to the events that took place on May Day in Portland.</em></p>
<p>The Industrial Workers of the World is proud that we were able to celebrate International Workers Day and march in solidarity with so many organizations which are essential and vibrant to the community of Portland and at large. International Workers Day is an important holiday that showcases the struggle of all workers against the wholesale societal systemic oppression brought about by corporations, CEOs, and the mega-rich capitalist class. The fact that there was such a strong contingent of marchers from all walks of life is representative of the American working class.</p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s use of violence against workers and their families &ndash; as well as the children who were in the crowd celebrating the holiday with their parents &ndash; is a travesty and a violation of both human rights, as well as the right to peaceful assembly. We condemn their efforts in restricting accessibility to fellow workers with disabilities, and their blatant disregard for the health and well-being of the people they have sworn to protect. By direct contrast, they assisted visible white supremacists and white nationalists at the &ldquo;March for Free Speech 82nd Ave,&rdquo; specifically a non-permitted march by pro-Trump supporters on April 29th by chartering Tri-Met buses and public transportation to get these people, some of whom were making Nazi salutes during their protest, back to their vehicles.</p>
<p>Our goal is and has always been to support and assist the workers of the world, and we will continue to fight for the needs of all in the face of police and capitalist oppression, and stand by our watchword that an injury to one is an injury to all. As such, the Portland Police Bureau inflicted shameful injury against the workers, their families, and their children during the May Day march; we will stand against that in solidarity with our fellow workers.</p>

After 15 years of service, Whole Foods retaliated against Julia for collectively organizing to win back a fellow worker&rsquo;s job. Since Julia&rsquo;s wrongful termination, she has made several appeals to the company&rsquo;s local and regional leadership only to be dismissed without justice. In December 2016, the manager who terminated Julia, Victor Vazquez, &nbsp;was fired along with eight other managers, for &lsquo;</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/whole-foods-accused-of-cheating-workers-out-of-bonuses-in-class-action-lawsuit/2016/12/21/104dfd7c-c705-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.7cf71eea2358"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stealing bonuses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;.

An injury to one is an injury to all!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our coalition was comprised of around sixty comrades including members of Many Languages One Voice (MLOV), the Comit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&eacute;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the IWW and its General Defense Committee (GDC), the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), Socialist Alternative, Future is Feminist, DC Stampede, DC Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), and the Socialist Snack Squad. We assembled at 10:30 am to review our overall strategy, our contingency escalation plan, and individual roles. The fulcrum of the action was a delegation of five comrades that accompanied Julia to Whole Foods to present her demands to the store manager in advance of the picket. Unsurprisingly, Whole Foods refused to negotiate and demanded the delegation leave the store. While we had no illusion that the bosses had any intention of conceding, workers organizing an effective picket should clearly articulate their demands to both the bosses as well as to the wider community. &nbsp;The delegation relayed the details of their meeting to the picket and then proceeded to canvas nearby businesses to put pressure on Whole Foods. At each stop the delegation explained the circumstances of Julia&rsquo;s wrongful termination, Whole Food&rsquo;s history of worker repression, and the delegation&rsquo;s recent treatment by the store manager. </span></p>

<p>If you are reading this then over 40,000 CWA union members have walked off their jobs as part of a three day strike against AT&amp;T. The strike at the telecommunications giant is just one of the latest in a string of strikes by workers in the industry that have all pushed back against attacks on wages, health care, job outsourcing, and corporate globalization.</p>
<p>Despite tough talk from both major capitalist parties and Trump in particular, since the economic meltdown of 2008, the only thing that has changed is that billions of dollars have moved out of the hands of poor and working-class people and into the hands of the billionaires &ndash; who are now running the government.</p>

<p>With the election of Trump, the demand for nonprofit fundraising is on the rise. Sadly, the people who do this important work are often poorly compensated for their much-needed labor. In Ann Arbor, employees of the progressive-oriented canvassing firm, Grassroots Campaigns Incorporated, are demanding better working conditions and higher wages.</p>
<p>To this end, canvassers and field managers with the Boston-based company's Ann Arbor office have applied for a National Labor Relations Board election for union recognition with the Industrial Workers of the World union. GCI employees submitted paperwork for the election on May 12. An overwhelming majority of workers at the company&rsquo;s Ann Arbor office have signed union cards.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided to organize, because we felt that the charitable organizations that we fundraise for would be less than thrilled to hear that the people who are doing the fundraising for them are being paid minimum wage with no benefits or any possibility of advancement,&quot; says GCI employee Brett Mcfann.</p> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first"><a href="../content/ann-arbor-canvassers-file-union-election-iww/" title="Read the rest of Ann Arbor canvassers file for union election with the IWW.">Read more</a></li><li class="upload_attachments last"><a href="../content/ann-arbor-canvassers-file-union-election-iww/#attachments" title="Read full article to view attachments.">1 attachment</a></li></ul> </div>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 05/08/2017 - 8:30pm</p>
<p><strong>By Patrick O&rsquo;Donoghue - <a target="_blank" href="https://tcorganizer.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/one-class-one-struggle-undocumented-and-citizen-workers-unite-on-may-day/"><em>The Organizer</em></a>, May 1, 2017</strong></p>
<h3><img src="../sites/default/files/images/IWWMayDay.jpg" width="320" align="right" height="240" alt="" />A Day of Resistance!</h3>
<p>Today is May Day, or as we in the labor movement call it, International Worker&rsquo;s Day- a day of celebration and resistance for working class people. It is a day not only of looking forward to the future, but also remembering the lessons of the past. May Day commemorates&nbsp;the struggle&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Haymarket Martyrs, a group of labor organizers, most of them immigrants, executed in Chicago for their work in the Eight Hour Day movement. The Eight Hour Day was the first time that workers around the world joined together in one campaign, supporting each other&rsquo;s strikes and protests around a&nbsp;single demand- reduce the work day to eight hours, without a cut in pay. The movement faced violence and arrests from governments, but eventually won in country after country. The eight hour day became the basic work day for workers across the countries where the movement fought, with victories across Europe, North and South America, Australia, Iran, Japan, and elsewhere. Over a century ago, workers realized the power we have when we refuse to be divided by borders, industry, or race.</p>
<p>This May Day is also the Day Without Immigrants. It is the latest in a wave of of day strike&nbsp;by immigrant workers- not only to protest&nbsp;wages and work conditions, but also to protest the Trump&rsquo;s plans to increase deportations.&nbsp;Under the Trump&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/politics/immigration-arrests-rise/">ramping up</a> of the Obama administration&rsquo;s already record-breaking deportations, ICE has increasingly targeted previously protected DREAMers and other undocumented people&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration-arrests-of-noncriminals-double-under-trump/2017/04/16/98a2f1e2-2096-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html?utm_term=.e7dd9246fd5a">not otherwise criminalized</a> by the state. ICE raids are becoming&nbsp;more regular even in &ldquo;Sanctuary Cities&rdquo;, and more of our neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends are being&nbsp;captured, torn from their homes, forced through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/us-deaths-immigration-detention">over-crowded detention centers</a> and&nbsp;courts <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/deportation-and-due-process">without due process</a>.</p>
<p>In the Twin Cities, many&nbsp;of the actions today are organized&nbsp;by CTUL, the <a target="_blank" href="http://ctul.net/">workers center for low wage workers of color</a>, especially immigrant workers. Even more of the walk outs and sick outs are &ldquo;wildcat&rdquo; actions organized on the shop floor between undocumented workers, without needing the go-ahead from a union or organizer.</p>
<p>By striking, these undocumented workers are showing how important they are to making the world run. How many restaurants are shut down today because the back end staff didn&rsquo;t come in? How many landscapers and construction companies who rely on day laborerers are not making money today? How many farm fields aren&rsquo;t being worked? Every day, undocumented immigrant workers do some of the toughest jobs in America, and the country starts to grind to a halt without immigrant workers.&nbsp;Deportations crackdowns have already left <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-06/crops-rot-while-trump-led-immigration-backlash-idles-farm-lobby">millions of dollars of produce</a> to rot in the fields in Alabama, Georgia, and California as farmers dependent on exploiting undocumented&nbsp;workers can&rsquo;t find Americans to work for as low as <a target="_blank" href="http://nfwm.org/education-center/farm-worker-issues/low-wages/">$10,000-$12,000 a&nbsp;</a><u>year.</u>&nbsp;The four industries with the most undocumented workforce- agriculture, cleaning and maintenance, construction, and food preparation and service- are all expecting labor shortages if Trump&rsquo;s deportation plan is carried out. American companies and bosses need our immigrant fellow workers- but the administration and parts of the press try to tell workers who are citizens that undocumented workers are hurting American working standards. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
