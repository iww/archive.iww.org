<a href="../content/atlanta-gmb-statement-planned-execution-troy-davis/" rel="bookmark">Atlanta GMB Statement on the Planned Execution of Troy Davis</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/20/2011 - 4:16pm</p>
<p>Troy Anthony Davis is obviously the most innocent man on the face of this earth.</p>
<p>Yet he continues to face down his executioner. There is no physical evidence against him. No court testimony which is not tainted by obvious bias. No doubting that Sylvester Coles, one of those to testify in court and one of the few who did not recant his testimony, identified that he himself was the shooter.</p>
<p>In our world innocence is a thing which must be proven, like in the old days of the Napoleonic Code of Law, as during the days of kings and queens and dungeon-and-cudgel justice. Until then, we are guilty.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World stands in solidarity with Troy Davis and his family. We call for the indefinite stay of his death sentence, and the death sentences of all those imprisoned by the laws of a country which prosecutes innocence by the testimony of the guilty. We call for his immediate release, without exception, without hesitation, and without doubt.</p>
<p>The IWW demands that the State of Georgia will recognize the impermissible and unacceptable nature of the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; and testimony submitted in court against him. We stand not just for the very serious and well-documented questions that exist about Troy Davis&rsquo; guilt; we stand for common decency, common justice, and common sense.</p>
<p>There are some things that the state of Georgia is guilty of itself: the worst history in the nation of executing and lynching innocent black people is one. It is a very old, hallowed tradition and we should like to see its continuance brought to an end. The State, too, is guilty of having the seventh highest rate of capital punishment convictions in the country. We call for an immediate end to this. We call for an end to all this vulgarity that is advanced as justice in this country. We call for all such poisons as pentobarbital and sodium thiopental to be neutralized, made harmless, and discarded.</p>
<p>The IWW intends to continue to march in solidarity with those in support of Troy Davis up to his planned execution date of Wednesday, September 21st, and beyond. We lock arms with those who call him friend, brother, son, and lover and expect to welcome him back into our midst any day now, when the conscience and good reason of those who detain him finally gives way to the plain notion that those who are innocent are not guilty, too.</p>
<p>We stand definitively and decidedly against those, like U.S. District Judge William T. Moore Jr., who will condemn Mr. Troy Anthony Davis to his death by the statement:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Troy Davis is not innocent.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>If this is not innocence, indeed, and if this is what not-innocence deserves, perhaps we are all guilty.</p>
<p>The IWW is Troy Davis, too.</p>
<p>In Solidarity, <br />
The Atlanta General Membership Branch of The Industrial Workers of the World.</p>

</h2>
<p><strong>Passed by the IWW General Executive Board, September 18, 2011:</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of our entire union, the General Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the World salutes you for your strong stance against union busting in the Port&nbsp; of Longview. <br />
<br />
Now, the state forces are starting to be used to break your struggle. We think now is not the time to back off. Around the world, from Egypt to Greece, the workers' movement is starting to rise up. The recent struggle against union busting in Wisconsin and your struggle in Longview shows that US workers are fed up too. We think that many thousands of workers throughout the West Coast are prepared to join in with you and show that together, we can put a stop to union busting, regardless of what the courts say. <br />
<br />
If this means returning to the methods of the 1930s, including work place occupations and mass pickets that back down to nobody, then so be it. <br />
<br />
We in the Industrial Workers of the World will do all in our power to help in your struggle. <br />

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 09/10/2011 - 2:15am</p>
<p><strong><img width="200" align="right" height="200" src="../sites/default/files/images/kc-iww-logo-full.preview.jpg" alt="" />By FW Zachary M.- September 9th, 2011</strong></p>
<p>A new organizing campaign is in full swing at a sub-sandwich shop. No, it&rsquo;s not Jimmy Johns, but a local Kansas City deli and pizzeria. The campaign, initiated by a brand new member in a brand new branch, started about four months ago when a worker joined the Wobblies and then realized that the IWW is the perfect platform for making changes at the oppressive restaurant he works at. I am that worker, and this is the beginning of our ongoing struggle to take over our workplace.</p>
<p>I started working at the shop about two years ago but only started to organize after becoming a Wobblie in April. After a mixture of stabbing in the dark, taking advice from the group that would later become the Greater Kansas City Branch, attending a wonderfully helpful meeting with some Wobblies from the Starbucks Union in Omaha in May, and then receiving an exceptional Organizer Training in June, some real organizing started to take place. Energized and educated by the Organizer Training, I started to rally my co-workers to defend each other at work. These activities lead to our first meetings where we committed to solidarity in the workplace and began to figure out the concrete problems at our shop. After a few more weeks of organizing and trying to establish some concrete ground from which to move forward, management decided to rearrange the structure of the store and started clamping down; enforcing new and old policies alike. This new enforcement of the rules led to understaffing as workers were fired or left due to frustration over harassment in the workplace. Management refused to replace these workers and then expected the few remaining workers to pick up the slack.</p>
<p>Then, at the beginning of August, things at our workplace started to heat up. Corporate management decided that they want to open more locations so they need a whole new set of rules and a rigid cost cutting strategy to squeeze every last penny out of every store. To do this they are using our location as a guinea pig and transferred in a management loyal worker who has worked for the company on and off for the last 20 years. This person, whom we refer to as the Corporate Manager (CM), for lack of a better term, is not a manager but is in charge of enforcing the new rules and cutting costs. During this transition, the assistant manager was fired due to rumors that he was taking home extra food.</p>
<p>The weekend after the firing, I was away on vacation, so the store was more understaffed than usual because the precedent is that no one is called in to cover shifts no matter how much notice is given that a worker will be off. On Saturday there were only two line cooks, Fellow Worker Charlie and another worker. The other line cook was sent out on a catering delivery. Our store never does catering on Saturday and the worker who was sent out had never done catering before. This left FW Charlie alone to do the work of what normally is done by three workers. The store starts to get busy with the lunch rush, so FW Charlie starts running back and forth between the lines making sandwiches and running them down to our expo line which is being worked by our store manager. FW Charlie forgot to write the name of a sandwich on the wrapper (writing the names on the wrappers is a new, superfluous policy being enforced as one of the many brand new &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; rules because the manager refuses to read the tickets we give him with the sandwiches). The manager picks up the sandwich and yells &ldquo;WRITE THE NAME ON THE GOD DAMN SANDWICH!&rdquo; and throws the sandwich at FW Charlie. Not surprisingly this upsets FW Charlie. He calmly takes off his hat and apron, clocks-out, and leaves without saying a word.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2011/09/pushing-the-envelope/" target="_blank"><strong>By Erin Hudson - <em>The McGill&nbsp;Daily</em>, September 2010</strong></a></p>
<p>On November 22, 2010, nine weeks after a new, arduous mail delivery system was introduced to Winnipeg, postal workers simply walked off the job. They had the consent of neither Canada Post nor their union leadership.</p>
<p>This is how Bob Tyre, president of the union&rsquo;s Winnipeg branch, tells it: &ldquo;One of our temporary workers said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do the new method. I&rsquo;m more than happy to do work in another depot &ndash; I&rsquo;ll deliver the old way &ndash; but this new way is too much for me and I can&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo; So they suspended him on the spot and that angered the building. We had four letter carrier depots in that building together. When the boss wouldn&rsquo;t back off, well, then, they walked out for a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walkout would set the stage for six months of workers&rsquo; struggles, culminating in this summer&rsquo;s mail strike. But the walkout would also inspire some workers to break with their union&rsquo;s powerful National Executive and to question the future of unions. From November 2010 to June 2011, anarchism arrived at the post office.</p>
<p>Last fall, Canada Post Corporation (CPC) introduced the Modern Post &ndash; a new method of delivering mail that would begin the transformation Canada Post believes they need in order to modernize, become financially sustainable, and maintain relevance in the digital age where mail volume per address is decreasing.</p>
<p>The Modern Post plans to motorize letter carriers and implement a two-bundle carrying method. The two-bundle system will consist of one bundle of presequenced mail to hold on the forearm, and a second bundle of flyers to be handed out at each point of call. Instead of letter carriers sorting their mail in the plant, machines will sequence the majority of mail, which means that letter carriers will spend more time on delivery routes.</p>
<p>Parcel delivery drivers will be almost completely eliminated. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) estimates that in Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, and Scarborough, 306 jobs will be cut as a result of the new system.</p>
<p>Outside a union meeting in Montreal, delivery agent Denis Auger Delegue said this is his first bad year at the post office in 32 years.</p>
<p>Modern Post was first implemented in Winnipeg&rsquo;s Southwest and Northeast depots. The system came in two waves, beginning the transition on September 20, and completing it on October 18.</p>
<p>On November 4, following a court decision prohibiting workers from refusing to work under Modern Post, the CUPW &ndash; which represents all Canadian postal workers &ndash; released a web bulletin weighing in on the matter. Their message: the union&rsquo;s collective agreement, which was set to expire at the end of January 2011, would not protect workers who walked off the job to protest the Modern Post.</p>
<p>With little concrete action taken by CUPW&rsquo;s National Executive, workers facing the daily challenges of the Modern Post took matters into their own hands.</p>
