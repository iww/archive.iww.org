<p><strong>Production Services Collective declaration to the ownership of Sound Stage Systems:</strong></p>
<p><img width="320" height="320" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/IWWBalloonWindow.jpg" alt="" />For nearly a year, as fellow workers, we have organized ourselves, put forth proposals, met and negotiated with you, the ownership and management of Sound Stage Systems. We have done these things in an attempt to create a democratic work place and a functional system of working that is inclusive, promotes creativity, compensates fairly and sees the value in cooperation rather than the unsustainable spiral of competition.</p>
<p>Our proposals have been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm and hostility. Weekly staff meetings have been attempted and some proposals implemented. Some workers have negotiated better wages on a one on one basis only to find the overtime they expected was now unattainable. Profit over substance has become the mode of operation. Clients' needs have been swept aside as cost over runs are hurriedly &ldquo;funded&rsquo; and new avenues of profit are exploited. New hires have been intimidated with the threat of firing during probation periods. Workers old and new have been &ldquo;talked to&rdquo; regarding trivial matters in an apparent attempt to intimidate. An atmosphere of intolerance for dissenting views, alternate methods, procedures and social/work culture is present daily.</p>
<p>We find ourselves in a continuous cycle of emotional and economic boom and bust. Daily we experience the torturous trickle down from a system that disregards our contributions and rights to self-determination and fair compensation. We have determined the only way out of this cycle and into routine control of our lives and movement forward lies in solidarity with workers locally and around the world who struggle daily to form the structures of a new way to work and live within the shell of the old.</p>
<p>It is with this in mind that we proudly declare ourselves members of the Industrial Workers of the World and move to build a work environment that fairly addresses the needs of client, worker and owner.</p>
<p>Before we can continue work on existing projects and before the discussion of work on new projects, we demand that you, the ownership and management of Sound Stage Systems, recognize us, the workers of Sound Stage Systems, as members of IWW IU630 (The Industrial Workers of the World, industrial union 630) and allow us the space to create a more democratic work place.</p>
<p>With a fresh prospective from this new owner/worker dynamic, we can discuss the details of the following additional demands;</p>
<ul>
<li>1) that as members of IWW IU630 we are given access to and input in every aspect of our role as workers on any project.</li>
<li>2) That as members of IWW IU630 we are the first to be responsible for the training, review and assignment to departments of any member or new hire for any project.</li>
<li>3) That as members of IWW IU630 we receive equal pay for equal work based on a four tier pay scale.</li>
<li>4) That travel project notifications will be a minimum of two weeks prior to booking.</li>
<li>5) That an open system for review and conflict resolution is established with no less than two IWW IU630 members present at any meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are no longer willing to participate in or make excuses for substandard work that is produced by a system beyond our control. We are dedicated to providing the best products and services in this industry. Within this new framework we are confident we can achieve this and create a work environment that will elevate every project Sound Stage System involves itself in, to this level and beyond.</p>

</em></p>
<p><img width="320" height="251" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/HotelFrank1.jpg" alt="" />Almost five years after I was illegally fired from my job as a bellman at Hotel Frank, the current owners of the Union Square hotel at Geary and Mason (now called Hotel G) are telling guests that there is no luggage service, that if they want to get their bags to or from their rooms they are on their own, and that if they want to store their luggage there is a roped-off area in the lobby where they can dump their bags, without any guarantee that they will be there when they want to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Hotel management recently instituted this goofy practice in order to keep me from coming back to work at the hotel.&nbsp; Quite a backhanded complement to my perceived organizing and troublemaking ability, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Here is an email that Matthew Rubenstein, the Associate Sales &amp; Social Media Manager at Hotel G, sent to a potential guest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do have a place in the lobby where you can store the luggage &ndash; it is a roped-off area by the front desk.&nbsp; Unfortunately we cannot transport the bags up to the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this, also from Mr. Rubenstein, responding to a question about the security of the &ldquo;roped-off area&rdquo; in the lobby:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, if it were me I would be fine leaving anything outside of laptops/cameras etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a photo of the &ldquo;roped-off area&rdquo; in the lobby.&nbsp; Note that there is a woman, presumably a hotel guest, going through some of the stored luggage:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/HotelFrank2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Note that the luggage is blocking a doorway.&nbsp; That is the door to the stairs from the basement, where the housekeeping office and the employee break room are located.&nbsp; With this door blocked, the only access to the basement is via the elevator.&nbsp; I wonder what the Fire Marshal might think of this.</p>

<h3><strong><img width="204" height="320" align="right" alt="" src="http://ecology.iww.org/images/gunkist-oranges.1699729.40.jpg" />BITE ON</strong></h3>
<p>Seventy years ago this week, Orange County&rsquo;s most brutally suppressed strike began with a bite.</p>
<p>On June 15, 1936, at the break of dawn, about 200 Mexican women gathered in Anaheim to preach the gospel of <em>huelga</em>&mdash;strike. Four days earlier, about 2,500 Mexican <em>naranjeros</em> representing more than half of Orange County&rsquo;s crucial citrus-picking force dropped their clippers, bags and ladders to demand higher wages, better working conditions and the right to unionize.</p>
<p>The women spread across the groves of Anaheim, the heart of citrus country, urging workers to let the fruit hang. Twenty Anaheim police officers confronted the women; they refused to disperse. At some point there was an altercation, and 29-year-old Placentia resident Virginia Torres bit the arm of Anaheim police officer Roger Sherman. Police arrested Torres, along with 30-year-old Epifania Marquez, who tried to yank a strikebreaker&mdash;a scab&mdash;from a truck by grabbing onto his suspenders.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the Fort Sumter of Orange County&mdash;newspaper accounts say only that Torres and Marquez received jail sentences of 60 and 30 days, respectively. But Orange County responded with an organized wrath years in the planning. Growers enlisted the local chapters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion to guard fields. They evicted families of strikers from their company-owned houses. The English-language press became a bulletin board for the growers&mdash;<em>The Santa Ana Register</em>, for instance, described the 200 Mexican women in Anaheim as &ldquo;Amazons with fire of battle in their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Orange County Sheriff Logan Jackson deputized citrus orchard guards and provided them with steel helmets, shotguns and ax handles. The newly minted cops began arresting strikers en masse, more than 250 by strike&rsquo;s end. When that didn&rsquo;t stop the strike, they reported workers to federal immigration authorities. When that didn&rsquo;t work, out came the guns and clubs. Tear gas blossomed in the groves. Mobs of citrus farmers and their supporters attacked under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>What county residents tried to dismiss as a fruitless strike quickly escalated into a full-fledged civil war in which race and class were inseparable. The Mexicans of Orange County, the county&rsquo;s historical source of cheap labor, were finally asking for better working conditions; their <em>gabacho</em> overlords wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. And so both sides fought for a month until the lords of Orange County won.</p>
<p>Wonder why Orange County trembles whenever its Mexicans protest? Welcome to the Citrus War of 1936, the most important event in Orange County history you&rsquo;ve never heard of.</p>

<p><b>Press Release</b><b> - <a href="https://htowniwwsolnet.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/houston-iww-wins-first-campaign-a-multi-worker-fight-against-a-remodeling-contractor/" target="_blank">Houston IWW</a>, August 11, 2015<br />
</b></p>
<p>We won!!</p>
<p>The fight against Felipe Serna has concluded.&nbsp; Serna wrote a check to Hector, Pancho, and Mauricio which was promptly cashed this morning.</p>
<p>After our letter delivery, folks will recall that we organized a phone blast of The Growing Tree daycare and Felipe&rsquo;s cell.&nbsp; It was very effective; his phone didn&rsquo;t stop ringing and he was in tears begging for mercy.&nbsp; But when the calls ceased, his verbal commitment to settling turned into indignation as he failed to follow through and after a few days texted us an image of his &ldquo;lawyer&rsquo;s&rdquo; business card, the second attorney he had threatened us with.</p>
<p>So we got indignant too and last night covered the surrounding neighborhood of The Growing Tree with &ldquo;Wanted for Wage Theft&rdquo; posters with his image prominently on the front.&nbsp; We made sure to leave one on the front door of the daycare.&nbsp; The next morning he wrote a check.</p>
<p>This is an important first victory for the Houston IWW and we couldn&rsquo;t have done it without your support.&nbsp; Thanks to the folks who showed up at the ass crack of dawn for the demand delivery and thanks to the many people who participated in the phone blast.</p>
<p>While we can&rsquo;t know if Serna will steal wages again, he will certainly consider the costs.&nbsp; And that is what we want every employer in Houston to do; consider that there are forces that they will have to contend with when they steal from labor-power.</p>
<p>We also know that to seriously challenge wage theft and to build workers power, we need an active and fighting working class, something we cannot create by sheer will.&nbsp; Instead, we do what we can with the resources we have until that becomes a general condition.&nbsp; In addition to fighting on the job, we need to fight against Adrian Garcia, the police, and ICE, we need to organize with detainees against incarceration, we need to defend our homes and neighborhoods from landlords and banks, we need to fight the grassroots Right and&nbsp;the fascists among them, we need to fight against racist school boards and curriculum, etc.</p>
<p>The IWW is committed to fighting against all of these forces.&nbsp; An injury to one is an injury all!!</p>
