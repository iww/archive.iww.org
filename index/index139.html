</p>
<p>On
January 8, 2009, there was a Press Conference in the Minnesota Capitol
in St Paul, organized by a coalition of &quot;Trade Union&quot; and so called
&quot;progressive&quot; groups.
</p>
The organization included
TakeAction Minnesota, AFSCME Council 5, Children's Defense Fund
Minnesota, Education Minnesota, ISAIAH, Minnesota Nurses Association,
SEIU Minnesota State Council, The AFL-CIO.
<br />
<br />
The Press Conference was organized to trumpet &quot;coalition representing
350,000 Minnesotans will launch its &quot;Make Health Happen&quot; campaign to
reform the state's health care system, which now leaves hundreds of
thousands of state residents without health coverage and many thousands
more underinsured.&quot;<br />
<br />
These group of self described &quot;progressives&quot; support the &quot;Minnesota
Health Security Act&quot; to be Introduced The group will also unveil the
&quot;Minnesota Health Security Act&quot; (MHSA) which charts a clear path to
guaranteed affordable health coverage for all Minnesotans, starting
with children. It will be introduced in both the House and Senate. The
bill is based on the Children's health Security Act, which successfully
passed the state House in 2007. The bill's authors, Representative Paul
Thissen and Senator Tony Lourey, will participate in the event.<br />

<div>
Statement of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union on the Purchase of a $45
Million Corporate Jet by Starbucks
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;The IWW Starbucks Workers Union is appalled that Starbucks spent $45
million on a new corporate jet so that CEO Howard Schultz could spend the
holidays in Hawaii glad-handing sports superstars while baristas and shift
supervisors are denied the work hours they need to make ends meet in the midst
of an economic crisis.  With that $45 million, Starbucks could provide over five
million additional work hours to employees in need or maintain its gutted 401k
program for three additional years.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Starbucks' new corporate jet only seats 19 passengers.  That leaves out
tens of thousands of us so-called partners.  As a company that claims to treat
all of its employees with &quot;respect and dignity&quot;, Starbucks should sell its
extravagant jet and use the money to benefit its workers and their families, not
just senior executives.  Starbucks should start by scaling back painful
across-the-board labor cuts and maintaining a transparent 401k matching plan, so
that workers know what to expect before they put their money away for
decades.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In today's dire economic climate, there is no room for this kind of
corporate extravagance.  Instead of bearing their share of the burden, Starbucks
management has recklessly chosen to further reward their poor performance.  As
Starbucks wastes much needed funds on unnecessary luxuries, it can expect
increased resistance from baristas and shift supervisors seeking job security
and sufficient work hours.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
The IWW Starbucks Workers Union (StarbucksUnion.org) is an organization of
almost 300 current and former employees at the world's largest coffee chain
united for secure work hours, a living wage, and an independent voice on the
job.  Through direct action, public education, and legal advocacy, the union
fights for systemic change at Starbucks and confronts management over unfair
treatment of individual employees.

The Industrial Workers of the World (iww.org) is a global grassroots union
open to all working people.

<div>
<img src="../graphics/anarchism/police_brutality01.gif" alt="" width="259" height="179" align="right" />
</div>
The cameraphone videos which have surfaced on
YouTube seem like a scene out of some futuristic movie. But the cold-blooded murder is all-too real, and is one more tragic body in the capitalist carnage that is already hundreds of years old.
<div>
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
Police brutality and racism are just as much parts
of capitalism as the real estate brutality that we are all facing. The ruthlessness and seeming irrationality of the BART murder is no different that that of
a broker who evicts a family that can't pay their mortgage. Capitalism
is
the only social system that sees overproduction as a problem -- when
too many people have homes, they must be evicted until houses become profitable again. It is the same with us the workers, who have to
sell our labor to live and can only live as long as we can sell our labor. Capitalism has always seen us, not as human beings, but just as one
more thing to be bought and sold. This is why it has been starving the workers, especially those from ethnic minorities, in all the
industrial cities of America for the last thirty years. It is the same kind of
&quot;market adjustment&quot; that is happening with houses right now. They are both done with the same ruthlessness and they both require armed
thugs called police.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
The capitalist media will claim that this is a case
of particularly bad cops, just as they claim that the economic crisis comes from bad
bankers. But bad cops and bad bankers will always exist as long as there are
cops and bankers, and there will always be cops and bankers as long as we allow ourselves to be robbed at work, as long as those who rob us
need men in ties to invest their stolen wealth and thugs to protect it.
Also, since our exploiters are only a tiny minority of society, they must divide up the majority. In the US, this , this means racism first and foremost. As Malcolm X said, &quot;You can;'t have capitalism without
racism.&quot;
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
To get rid of a system that relies on murderers, the
workers of Oakland and the entire world have to develop a revolutionary form of
unionism, one that recognizes the inherent opposition between workers and
bosses and which wants to end exploitation. The Oakland General Strike of
1946, and the workers occupation of Republic Windows in 2008 both give us a glimpse of how powerful we really are.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
We want to express our deepest condolences to the
family and friends of Oscar Grant, and on the issue of this police execution, we call for
the immediate arrest of the police involved on charges of first-degree murder.

We, the New York City General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers
of the World--an international, rank-and-file labor
union--enthusiastically express solidarity with the occupants of the central offices of the
General Confederation of Labour of Greece and the Thessaloniki Trade Unions
Center. The brave, and principled, actions of our working class brothers and
sisters in Greece is an inspiration to us. We recognize that our struggle is
one, and offer the fullest capacity of our solidarity and support.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In addition, we offer our condolences to the family, friends, and
comrades of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 16-year old boy whose murder by the
police last month triggered a widespread uproar from workers, students and
the downtrodden throughout Greece. We also stand with Konstantina Kuneva,
an immigrant worker in Athens who recently fell victim to a severe
retaliatory attack while organizing for decent conditions for the workers of the
Attica Union of Domestic Workers and Cleaners. Consistent with the demands of
the occupants, we demand a full investigation of the attack with justice for
the perpetrators, and that Konstantina's employers comply with the just
demands of her union. We also call for an end to the abuse and lethal brutality
of Greek law enforcement and reactionaries on working people, immigrants,
and the youth.

<div>
<img src="../graphics/labor/globsolired.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
The following motion was passed at the San Francisco Bay Area GMB January meeting, Thursday, Janury 8, 2009 with few dissenting votes:
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;WHEREAS the Apartheid State of Israel has conducted a siege of Gaza
for many months; and
</div>
<br />
<div>
WHEREAS this siege, itself, is an act of war as well as an act of collective punishment; and
</div>
<br />
<div>
WHEREAS  this siege is simply a further extension of the apartheid policies of the State of Israel, including calls within Israel for
ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Israel, stealing of land and water
rights from Palestinians both within Israel as well as in the West Bank, and
the
</div>
<div>
building of the Apartheid Wall, as well as other measures; and
</div>
<br />
<div>
WHEREAS the Industrial Workers of the World stands for working class unity, which is impossible as long as any sector of the working class
is oppressed in the way that the Palestinian people are by the State of Israel; now be it
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that the San Francisco chapter of the IWW unreservedly condemns the Israeli attack on the people of Gaza; and be it
further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we also oppose all terrorist acts aimed at civilians, whether they be Palestinian, Jew or anybody else, and in this
particular case we recognize that the rocket attacks on Israel being carried out
by Hamas can only serve as a cover for official Israeli racism and expansionism, even though we recognize that the State of Israel bears primary responsibility for the situation; and be it further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we call for complete Israeli withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders, including dismantling of the settlements and the Apartheid
Wall, the right to return of the Palestinians driven into refugee status,
and for equal rights for all within the State of Israel; and be it
further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we recognize that the Histadrut leadership, in their
support for the Israeli bosses and the bosses' politicians as well as their support for the apartheid policies of the State of Israel, have
placed themselves squarely in the camp of the class opponents of the working class; and be it further
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we oppose the state imposition of or support for any religion; and be it finally
</div>
<br />
<div>
RESOLVED that we will support any steps to oppose division within the working class as well as racism and all forms of special oppression in
our struggle for workers' rights and workers' power internationally.&quot;
