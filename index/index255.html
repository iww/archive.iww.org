</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 10/26/2005 - 12:15am</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/agitators/modern/others/strike_chalkboard.jpg" align="right" border="0" /><strong>Professor points to politics as Yale fails to renew contract<br /></strong><br />By MATT APUZZO - <em>Associated Press</em> Writer, October 23, 2005, 3:18 PM EDT<br /><br /><strong>NEW HAVEN, Conn</strong>. -- By all accounts, Yale anthropology professor David Graeber is one of the brightest minds in his field. His books are taught worldwide and the London School of Economics recently asked him to give its annual Malinowski lecture, an offer reserved for the world's most promising young anthropologists. <br /><br />And he's about to be unemployed. <br /><br />Graeber is an anarchist whose counterculture writings are nearly as popular as his academic work. He carries an Industrial Workers of the World union card and has been arrested during anti-globalization protests. <br /><br />So when Yale recently told Graeber not to return next year, it touched off a letter-writing campaign from professors worldwide, some of whom suggested that the Ivy League university is letting politics influence its hiring. <br /><br />&quot;It's extremely odd that one of the most brilliant anthropologists is being excluded from the department at Yale in such an extraordinary fashion,&quot; said Maurice Bloch, a London School of Economics anthropologist and one of many professors to write letters to Yale. <br /><br />Graeber, who has taught at Yale since 1998, has appealed the decision. University spokesman Tom Conroy said the university is negotiating an informal settlement but would not discuss the reasons behind the contract decision. <br /><br />Dozens of the 250 non-tenured professors at Yale come up for contract renewal each year, Conroy said, and it's not unusual for them to leave. He said some leave for personal reasons or take tenure-track jobs at other universities. Others, like Graeber, are not renewed. <br /><br />Graeber, 44, is the son of a seamstress and a print plate stripper and still lives in the same New York City co-op where he grew up. &quot;Socialist housing,&quot; he calls it. He wears cargo pants to class and is not shy about his disdain for the tenured Yale faculty who showed him the door. <br /><br />&quot;I'm both more productive intellectually than they are and I'm having more fun. It must drive them crazy,&quot; he said in an interview. <br /><br />Later, he added: &quot;I'm publishing like crazy. I'm all over the place. I try hard not to rub it in.&quot; <br /><br />Graeber said he got along with his colleagues at first and passed a three-year review before leaving for sabbatical in 2001. While away from New Haven, Graeber joined groups such as the Direct Action Network and Ya Basta and began appearing at anti-war and anti-globalization protests and in newspaper articles. <br /><br />When he returned to Yale, he said things changed. <br /><br />&quot;All of a sudden, people weren't speaking to me,&quot; he said. <br /><br />At his six-year review, he said he was given only a short-term renewal because some colleagues expressed concerns. <br /><br />&quot;It was incredibly petty,&quot; Graeber said. &quot;It was stuff like, 'He turns in grades late, comes in late to class.' Really stupid little things.&quot; <br /><br />He said he made more enemies by objecting when some colleagues tried to kick out a graduate student. The student, Christina Moon, was an organizer trying to unionize graduate students and prepare a strike. <br /><br />This spring, when his contract was up for review again, the department voted not to extend it. Like all employment decisions, it was made behind closed doors. Even Graeber doesn't get to know why. <br /><br />Andrew Hill, chairman of anthropology at Yale, did not return a call for comment. He told the student-run Yale Daily News that professors should not assume they will be rehired. <br /><br />Enrique Mayer, a Yale anthropology professor who was in the department's meeting, said he doesn't believe Graeber was fired simply for being an anarchist. <br /><br />&quot;I have my own opinions, but I'm gagged,&quot; Mayer said. &quot;There are people who don't like his politics and people who don't like internal graduate student issues. That's true.&quot; <br /><br />Despite being eccentric _ an adjective echoed by several anthropologists and students _ Graeber's classes are among the most popular in the department, Mayer said. <br /><br />&quot;If Yale can't cope with eccentric possibilities, that's rather odd,&quot; Bloch said. &quot;It's had many in the past. He doesn't run around naked in the middle of lectures. He doesn't do anything as radical as that.&quot; <br /><br />Moon, a doctoral candidate, is one of dozens of anthropology students who signed a student petition supporting Graeber. She said he is the department's most popular professor but is not liked by the senior faculty. <br /><br />&quot;He was really challenging the attitudes, the politics and the conservative views of the department,&quot; Moon said. <br /><br />Since Graeber's firing, he has become a cause celebre for student union activists. It's bittersweet, he said, because he disagrees with the union's centralized organization and tried hard not to get political on campus. <br /><br />&quot;I figured, I'll be an anarchist in New York and a scholar in New Haven,&quot; he said. <br /><br />Peter McLaren, a UCLA professor and outspoken Marxist who is among more than 4,000 names on a general online petition supporting Graeber, said that can be difficult. He said he was similarly fired early in his career. <br /><br />&quot;It's the professors that get active locally and in their communities, where newspapers stories come out about them. They're the professors very often that are in trouble,&quot; he said. &quot;If you keep your ideas to your politics and your books, you're OK.&quot; <br /><br />As negotiations continue between Graeber and Yale, letters keep arriving on campus. A student-run Web site supporting Graeber has collected nine letters signed by several dozen professors. <br /><br />&quot;It has also led to widespread speculation on the motives that lie behind it,&quot; University of Chicago faculty members wrote. &quot;None of this can do anything but a disservice to anthropology at Yale and to the discipline at large.&quot; <br /><br />With his job prospects for next year uncertain, Graeber didn't renew a lease on his apartment. He splits his time between his New York co-op and apartments in New Haven where friends let him sleep. <br /><br />Though he said he'd like to stay at Yale, he's touching up his resume just in case. But he worries whether his reputation is tainted. <br /><br />&quot;Anybody looking at this is going to think one of two things: Either Yale is very, very bad or I did something very, very bad and they're not saying what it is. You're going to cut it either way depending on how you feel about anarchists and how you feel about Yale.&quot; <br /><br />___ <br /><br />On the Net: <br /><br />David Graeber's official Web site: <a href="https://www.iww.org:2096/horde/services/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yale.edu%2Fanthropology%2Fpeople%2Fdgraeber.html" target="_blank">http://www.yale.edu/anthropology/people/dgraeber.html</a>&nbsp; <br /><br />Student-run protest site: <a href="https://www.iww.org:2096/horde/services/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.com%2Fgraebersolidarity%2F" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/graebersolidarity/</a>&nbsp;</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_34 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/educational-worker/" rel="tag" title="All workers in educational institutions.">Educational Workers Industrial Union 620</a></li></ul> </div>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 10/25/2005 - 4:55pm</p>
<p><strong>By Jon Bekken - <em>Industrial Worker</em>, October 2005.</strong></p><p><img width="329" height="246" border="1" align="right" src="../graphics/photos/color/events/Judy_Ancel_6.jpg" />More than 50 economists and labor activists went to Kansas City Sept. 15 &ndash; 17 for a conference on radical economics and the labor movement organized as part of the IWW centenary. Presentations addressed a wide variety of topics, from historical work to studies of recent efforts by Latin American workers to defend their labor standards through strikes and worker collectives. Other papers sought to update IWW and Marxian economic analysis, reported on initiatives to bring radical economic analysis to broader audiences, and explored the intersection between radical economics and economic thinkers such as Galbraith and Sraffa. In addition, there was a tour of Kansas City labor history sites (shortened by bad weather), culminating in a performance of Wobbly songs in the old City Market by Bob and Judy Sukiel. The idea was to bring together economists and labor activists for a dialogue which might restore the dialogue between economists and working-class movements that once posed a vital challenge to the dominance of capitalism&rsquo;s house economists. As Dirk Philipsen of Virginia State University noted in his presentation on historical struggles for economic democracy, &ldquo;It is clear that corporate capitalism is not sustainable. It is not realistic to believe that it can survive.&rdquo; And so there is an urgent need to open a conversation about economic alternatives. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 10/22/2005 - 2:55am</p>
<p>The Stockholm Subway closed for five hours in an unofficial strike by the train-drivers on Thursday the 6<sup>th</sup> of October. It made chaos in the traffics during the rush-hours when hundred of thousand people could not use the Subway to come to their work places. Some hundred train-drivers protested the sacking of their union chairman, Per Johansson, in a massive manifestation of anger and solidarity.</p><p>Per Johansson has been an active representative for the members of SEKO (the LO-affiliated union for service and communication) which organises most of the train-drivers in the Stockholm Subway. Since a couple of years the Subway has been run by the multinational company Connex, and the unions have felt that money nowdays are more interesting in the public transportation then issues as security and good working conditions.</p><p>Connex sacked Per Johansson September 29, refering he has been &quot;disloyal&quot; to the company and had acted &quot;improperly&quot; to other workers. One of the situations that Connex mentioned was an episode from the Syndicalist train-drivers strike in March, when he told a scab not to work.</p><p>Both members of SEKO-union and the members of the Syndicalist Job Branch in the Subway had reacted strongly against the sacking. It has been seen as an attack on the right of free speach as well as an attack on trade union-rights. The SAC General Secretary Lars Hammarberg demanded changes in the labour laws in an debate article in the biggest Swedish daily paper, Aftonbladet, October the 7<sup>th</sup>, with the sacking and the unofficial strike as background. It is possible for Connex to run a juridicial process for months in the Labour Court, and then &quot;buy out&quot; Per Johansson, giving him high severance pay and paying damages to the SEKO-union. By these labour laws Connex can get rid of union activists. And, legally, the workers are not allowed to go on strike as a countermeasure. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_30 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-500-transportation-and-communicatio-2/" rel="tag" title="

The Teamsters and Service Employees unions withdrew on the eve of the convention; the United Food and Commercial Workers quit the Federation as delegates were leaving Chicago.</p><p> </p> The Change to Win Coalition kicked things off with a high-energy press conference packed with union staffers. The presidents of all six CWC unions - SEIU, Unite-HERE, Teamsters, UFCW, Laborers and United Farm Workers - spoke to an enthusiastic crowd, but the surface unity quickly dissolved when things got down to specifics. Four Coalition unions boycotted the AFL convention, two said they would participate. The officers were unwilling to say whether their unions would formally quit the AFL-CIO; the decisions trickled in over the next few days.<p> </p> While CWC representatives said the split was over the need to &quot;restructure&quot; the Federation to focus resources on organizing, &nbsp;the closest thing to a specific illustration of differences on offer was when SEIU President Andy Stern contrasted the wording of the AFL leadership's and CWC's resolutions: where the AFL-CIO resolutions employed the word &quot;should,&quot; the Coalition used the word &quot;shall.&quot; Such momentous differences can not help but inspire a movement.<p> </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_76 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all IWW Departments and Unions.
