<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/JimmyJohns3.jpg" align="right" /><b>Sandwich Workers and Customers Unite in Support of Working Class Hero</b></p>
<p>Press Conference and Delegation: 1pm Sunday September 26, Calhoun Square Jimmy Johns, 3001 Hennepin Ave. S.</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS– When Shift Supervisor Margaret Brickely began her morning prep work at Jimmy John's last Monday, she noticed that all of the meat and produce she pulled out of the cooler was warm and beginning to rot. The coolers had broken, leaving the meat at room temperature overnight. Margaret refused to serve the meat. Now, Jimmy John's is threatening her job in retaliation.</p>
<p>“The vegetables were shriveled, the meat hot, and the bread dough semi-cooked. This is not something I was willing to serve” says Margaret. “I called my District Manager Jason Effertz to inform him that the meat was rotten, and he ordered me to slice it and serve it. When I refused, Effertz came in and sliced the meat himself, preparing to sell it to customers.”</p>
<p>With the support of the newly-organized Jimmy Johns Workers Union, Margaret and her coworkers called the City of Minneapolis Health Department. A City Health Inspector came to the store, condemned the meat as unfit for human consumption, and forced management to throw it all away.</p>
<p>Had Margaret not taken a stand for proper sanitation, hundreds of customers would have been served rotten meat.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.

<p>Dear New Socialist Group, <br /><br />A friend recently sent me issue 60 of <em>New Socialist</em>. I enjoyed reading it, especially the discussions of unions and union organizers. I plan to read a lot more of your writings as soon as I'm able. <br /><br />In this letter I'd like to pose some respectful questions and criticisms. I also want to think out some issues I am unclear about and have been having conversations about with some close friends and comrades. Just so we're clear, and since electronic communication makes it much easier to come off polemical when that's not my intention, I mean these as a sort of "can think about this together?" rather than an attempt at the sort of point scoring that sometimes stands in for political discussion. I've only read some of your publications - I plan to read more of them - so if you deal with my questions elsewhere I would love to know. I should also say, I'm a member of the small radical union the Industrial Workers of the World and the small political organization the Workers Solidarity Alliance. My experiences in those organization shape my views, but I write in a personal capacity. <br /><br />I liked the piece on the comrade who worked for SEIU. It did well in getting at some of the limits of AFL-CIO and CtW unionism. I would like to know, however, if she learned anything positive from doing that work. Perhaps she didn't. My experience working as an organizer had a lot of the negative components that that comrade described and others too, which is why I no longer do that kind of work. I ran into iterations of the same problems when I worked as a community organizer too.) <br /><br />That said, as much as working as an organizer was a lousy job, I learned a ton doing that job. As much as the bosses were jerks, I learned a lot from following their orders and from the training they provided. I learned stuff which set me up to go on to organize at my own workplaces in the jobs I worked afterward, and this has enriched my IWW activity too, in my opinion. I'd like to know if NSG has anything to say about working as organizers in order to learn things for a while - not as a career path but as an educational detour. Personally, I think more radicals should so then come back to the shop floor. <br /></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p>Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood has been without accessible bus service for over a decade. The CTA’s 31st st. bus route was eliminated as a ‘cost-cutting measure’ in 1998, leaving schools, businesses, and residents isolated from the city’s expansive transit network. The Little Village community, LVLHS, and the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization spent years mounting <a href="http://areachicago.com/p/issues/institutions-and-infrastructures/busy-building-buslines/" target="_blank">an unsuccessful campaign </a>to reopen/expand the CTA’s 31<sup>st</sup> St. route; as of the recent cuts in bus service throughout Chicago, which have resulted in the loss of <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/news/default.aspx?Month=&amp;Year=&amp;Category=2&amp;ArticleId=2558" target="_blank">nine express routes and over 1,000 transit jobs</a>, it has become clear that <strong>progress is impossible unless members of the community take control of their transit options.</strong></p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_229 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/chicago-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Chicago General Membership Branch.

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/21/2010 - 3:21pm</p>
<p><b>Marie Mason Transferred to a new prison in Carswell, Texas.
By Kenneth Miller and Erik Davis - {based on original story by FW Miller for the <i>Defiant Spirit</i>}</b></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/marie_fciwaseca.jpg" height=360 width=259 align="right" />Fellow Worker Marie Mason, a long-time member of the Industrial Workers of the World, is currently serving a 22-year sentence for two acts property destruction in 1999 and 2000, events in which no injuries were intended, and in which none occurred.</p>
<p>Marie has received the longest sentence of any of the Green Scare defendants, whose prosecution in America appears to be the new front line in the revived COINTELPRO-esque actions of the state. While there is room in our union for discussion and disapproval of the acts that resulted in Marie's imprisonment, the more significant issues before us are the use of Green Scare prosecutions to pioneer a new set of repressive laws and punishments for those who oppose the state in general, and capitalism and its depredations in particular.</p>
<p>The Twin Cities GMB of the IWW voted to 'adopt' FW Mason when she was transferred to a Federal facility in Minnesota, in Waseca, about an hour and a half from the Twin Cities. I was able to make a few visits during her period here, and exchanged many letters. I found her to be an astonishing person, full of optimism and struggle, even in her dire circumstances. She taught guitar and music lessons, and organized with the self-named group of "Spanish Mommies" (Spanish-language speaking imprisoned mothers). Her personal struggles were not her focus, although they were considerable. As a vegan and a practicing Buddhist, she was never permitted a proper diet or the ability to properly practice her faith.</p>
<p>Marie has now been transferred to a new federal facility in Carswell, Texas, near our sisters and brothers in Fort Worth. Marie was held in a Solitary Housing Unit for a considerable amount of time both prior to the transfer and after. While she is now out of solitary, her unit has only 16 others, and they are never permitted to leave the building in which they are housed (i.e., no time outside at all). It is unclear whether her dietary or religious needs are being properly addressed.</p>
<p>At this time, FW Marie needs our actions, and our solidarity. You can help out significantly merely by writing to her; the address is below. Please DO NOT SEND MONEY, as she will be fined for this and the money confiscated. We also hope that fellow workers in Fort Worth and the Carswell area will consider formally 'adopting' her the way the Twin Cities branch did, and make attempts to visit her.</p>
<p>Write her at MARIE MASON #04672-061, FMC CARSWELL, FEDERAL MEDICAL CENTER, P.O. BOX 27137, FORT WORTH, TX 76127 She is being represented by a lawyer at the Civil Liberties Defense Fund in Eugene, Oregon. Contact Kenneth Miller at 412-867-9213 if you are in the Carswell/Fort Worth area.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 09/21/2010 - 2:52am</p>
<p><b>Sandwich Workers Union Keeps the Pressure on as Unprecedented Union Election Approaches</b></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/jjworkers2sm.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS– Jimmy John’s workers were doing more than preparing french bread, cold cuts, and sliced tomatoes for “Dollar Sub Day” this morning as union members and supporters hit the bricks outside stores, asking customers to put up tip jars and use them.</p>
<p>The act of civil disobedience is meant to draw attention to a company policy that forbids tip jars, despite the fact that it costs nothing.</p>
<p>Union members say the action supports their goal of shifting power back to the workers. “We think having customers act in solidarity by putting up tip jars will give workers a glimpse of a better workplace, and a few more dollars in their pockets on one of the most hectic days” says Max Specktor, a bike delivery driver at multiple Jimmy John’s stores.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_587 first"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/twin-cities-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Twin Cities GMB">Twin Cities GMB</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_695"><a href="../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/food-retail-workers-organizing/jimmy-johns/" rel="tag" title="">Jimmy Johns</a></li><li class="taxonomy_term_36 last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-600-public-service/restaurant-hotel-a/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Restaurant, Hotel, and Building Service Workers Industrial Union 640.
