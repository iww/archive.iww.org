<p>National Lawyers Guild Labor & Employment Committee and Immigrant Workers of the Campaign for Justice at Flaum Appetizing to Be Honored at the 2nd Annual Brandworkers Awards Dinner</p>
<p>New York, NY -- Leading lights from the progressive legal and organizing communities will be honored on October 28th at the 2nd Annual Brandworkers Awards Dinner. The National Lawyers Guild Labor & Employment Committee and the Workers of the Campaign for Justice at Flaum Appetizing Corp. will receive "Champions of Economic Justice" awards to honor their achievements in the movement to win fair pay, equality, and respect for all workers.</p>
<p>"We couldn't be more gratified to honor these inspiring fighters for economic justice," said Daniel Gross, the founding director of Brandworkers. "They are in the trenches every day waging innovative and dynamic campaigns for workplace justice and dignity. It's an honor for Brandworkers to acknowledge their tremendous contributions to the movement."</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Guild Labor & Employment Committee is the country's leading organization of progressive lawyers, legal workers, and law students serving labor unions, worker centers, and individual employees. The Committee is on the cutting-edge of providing innovative legal strategies to combat the intense employer resistance that characterizes organizing drives in the United States today. Firm believers in the need for global solidarity, the Committee and its members are leading participants in the international labor rights arena and recently helped spearhead the landmark amicus brief to the Mexican Supreme Court, filed by 47 prominent labor rights organizations and attorneys from around the world, in opposition to the Mexican Government's attempt to undermine the independence of the National Union of Mine, Metal, Steel and Allied Workers.</p>
<p>The Workers of the Campaign for Justice at Flaum Appetizing Corp. are recent immigrants from Mexico and Ecuador using innovative legal, advocacy, and organizing tools to challenge sweatshops conditions at one of New York City's top processors and distributors of kosher foods. The workers are members of the Focus on the Food Chain campaign, a joint initiative of Brandworkers and the Industrial Workers of the World (NYC) labor union, to create good, family-supporting jobs in the food processing and distribution warehouses of New York. Flaum Appetizing illegally withheld hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation owed to workers and responded with vicious anti-immigrant retaliation when workers stood up for their rights. Despite the illegal retaliation, the workers of Flaum, through diligent and creative organizing, are well on their way to win justice at the company. The workers' effort to limit the scope of the Hoffman Plastic Supreme Court case, which condoned discrimination against many workers based on immigration status, could have important ramifications for workplace justice projects across the country.</p>

<p><b>Support Builds for Sandwich Workers in Run-up to Historic Union Election with Rally Planned for Monday.</b></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/jjworkers1.jpg" width=250 height=166 align="right" />Rally and Press Conference: 5:30pm Monday 10/18, Block E Jimmy John's</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS– The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation has voted to endorse the IWW Jimmy John's Workers Union, throwing the weight of its 75,000 members in 125 affiliated labor unions behind the unprecedented effort to unionize franchised fast food. 200 Jimmy John's workers at 10 Minneapolis locations will vote in an historic NLRB union election on October 22nd. If a majority of workers vote in favor of unionization, 10 Minneapolis Jimmy John's will become the first union fast food franchise in the United States.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for this support. The franchise owner Mike Mulligan has been saying we aren't a 'real' union. If we're not 'real,' then why does the largest union federation in this city support us? We are very real, and we are going to win our demands for fair wages, consistent scheduling, sick days, and respect,” said Ayo Collins, a member of the union at the Ninth St. Jimmy John's.</p>
<p>Franchise owner Mike Mulligan has refused to address the workers grievances over pay hovering around minimum wage, shifts as short as one hour, and pressure on workers to work while sick. Instead, Mulligan has employed a third-party union-busting firm at an estimated cost of $3000 per day to undermine the unionization effort with a campaign of captive audience meetings, misinformation, and misrepresentations, often crossing over into illegality.</p>
<p>In response, the IWW Jimmy Johns Workers Union has filed Unfair Labor Practice charges over 22 alleged labor rights violations. The National Labor Relations Board is investigating the charges.</p>
<p>Despite a harsh employer response, the sandwich workers remain confident of victory.</p>
<p>“You can only keep people down for so long. We are standing up for better wages, consistent hours, and a better life for ourselves and our coworkers. And we know that millions of fast food workers across the country are watching. We will win,” said David Boehnke, a union member at the Skyway Jimmy John's.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.</p>

<a href="../node/5231/" rel="bookmark">Ottawa Busker Appeals Conviction</a>
</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sun, 10/10/2010 - 1:31pm</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/agitators/classic/robbedlg.jpg" align="right" height=267 width=229 />When the City of Ottawa installed speakers and started broadcasting muzak in busker Raymond Loomer's favourite underpass, he cut the speaker wires one day in May 2009. He then taped the wire on the door of the office door of the Downtown Rideau Business Improvement Area, a business lobby group that has waged a campaign to remove street people and performers from the city centre.</p>
<p>As a tin flute player, he was one of several buskers who relied on the unique acoustics of the downtown Ottawa underpass near the Rideau Centre shopping centre to make a living. Loomer is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). He did not take kindly to having his live music replaced by a machine.</p>
<p>"They were playing music to interfere with our industry," he said.</p>
<p>City police arrested Loomer and charged him with two counts of mischief under $5,000. He was convicted on May 25, 2010 with a sentence of 12 months probation and 20 hours community service. Loomer represented himself and has appealed, saying the city failed to provide bylaw information he could have used in his defense and that he has rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to make a living and freedom of expression. He objected to the community service as "the slave style practices of government" for appropriating his labour power.</p>
<p>Loomer's appeal will be heard on November 12, 2010 at the city courthouse.</p>
<p>Ottawa had introduced restrictive bylaws requiring street performers to get a license and perform in designated spots chosen by the city. Ontario's Safe Streets Act, brought in to target squeegee kids, buskers and other street people making a living on the province's streets, has set the stage for tighter controls on informal workers.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 10/08/2010 - 1:55pm</p>
<p><b>Jimmy Johns Workers Join National Day of Action in Defense of Education</b></p>
<p><img src="../graphics/IU640/dinkytown.jpg" align="right" />MINNEAPOLIS– Dinkytown will resound with protest chants and techno beats at 4pm this afternoon as Jimmy Johns workers and student allies join in a dance party protest of low service industry wages and skyrocketing tuition at the nation's colleges and universities.</p>
<p>“There's no way you can pay for school or pay off student loans on the poverty wages workers like us make at Jimmy John's and other fast food businesses,” said Emily Pzybylski a delivery driver at the Dinkytown Jimmy Johns and student at the University of Minnesota. "High tuition and low wages turn these into dead-end jobs," she added.</p>
<p>Many Jimmy Johns workers are either attending college, paying back student loans, or hoping to go back to school for additional job training in order to escape low-wage service industry employment. As college and university tuition has increased, the dream of higher education has become an unreachable mirage for many. Tuition at the University of Minnesota has more than doubled in the last decade. At the same time, university graduates have found fewer and fewer job opportunities, prompting <i>BusinessWeek</i> to dub today's young workers “The Lost Generation” because of high rates of joblessness and chronic underemployment.</p>
<p>“People say 'get a better job.' What they don't realize is that places like Jimmy Johns are some of the only jobs that are left. We decided to organize a labor union at Jimmy Johns because if we're going to be stuck in this service economy, then it needs to provide quality jobs for working families. We are not going to be a 'lost generation',” said Ayo Collins, a worker at the sandwich chain.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board will conduct a union election for 200 Jimmy Johns employees at 10 Minneapolis locations on October 22, a historic first for the nation's largely non-union fast food industry. If a majority of Minneapolis Jimmy Johns workers vote in favor of the union, franchise owners Mike and Rob Mulligan will be legally required to negotiate in good faith over the terms of a contract. The Jimmy Johns Workers Union is seeking improved wages, sick days, consistent scheduling, and basic respect for workers.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Johns Workers Union, open to employees at the company nationwide, is affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World labor union. Gaining prominence in recent years for organizing Starbucks workers, the IWW is a global union founded over a century ago for all working people.</p>
