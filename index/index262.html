<p>By Shay Totten | Vermont Guardian</p> <p><em>posted July 29, 2005 </em></p> <p>Vermont, the home of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys. That&rsquo;s the history many schoolkids learn year after year, and it&rsquo;s one that is often invoked by politicians, thinkers, and op-ed writers.</p> <p>Yet, there is a separate, but distinct, history more than a century after the Allen boys that took shape in and around the granite quarries of Barre &mdash; the Italian socialist and anarchist granite workers who were not only unionized, but upon whose backs were spawned Vermont&rsquo;s major export products.</p> <p>At the center of this history is Barre&rsquo;s Old Labor Hall, which sits squarely in what was known as the &ldquo;Socialist Block.&rdquo; An illustration of the spirit of the era is best captured in a preserved photograph, which shows a crowd of people inside the hall flanked by wall portraits of Karl Marx. During its heyday, people gathered to eat, dance, and hear the renowned speakers of the day &mdash; Samuel Gompers, Eugene Debs, Mother Jones, Emma Goldman, and Joseph Etter, to name a few.</p> <p>The union members during the early 1900s were not only civic minded, but politically motivated.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_408 first last"><a href="../category/branches/all-branches/montpelier-gmb/" rel="tag" title="Montpelier IWW">Montpelier GMB</a></li></ul> <ul class="links link-links"><li class="node_read_more first last"><a href="../node/1198/" title="Read the rest of  Welcome Back, Wobblies: Barre’s Old Labor Hall Celebrates the Past.">Read more</a></li></ul> </div>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 07/27/2005 - 12:06am</p>
<p><img border="0" align="right" src="../graphics/agitators/classic/solidcircleA.jpg" />We can all agree that the AFL-CIO, and business unionism in general, is a dead-end for the working class in North America. We need a new international labor movement; one that is based on workers&rsquo; self-organization and on the recognition of the inevitable conflict between labor and capital.</p> <p>We of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) have stayed close to our roots and feel that we have some ideas and lessons, learned from bitter experience, for such a new labor movement. We feel that a new labor movement will have to return to the strategies and tactics of the workers&rsquo; movement before it&rsquo;s decent into the bureaucratic quagmire of business unionism if it is to go forward.</p> <p><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> </p> <p>We have a few suggestions on how to proceed:</p> <ol> <li>Organize the unorganized into self-managed industrial unions. Unions built from the grass-roots by worker organizers. Unions run by the membership to address their own needs and aspirations on the job. Unions that are independent of government and political parties. Unions that welcome all wage workers and unemployed, regardless of nationality, race, gender, political or religious creed, sexual orientation, etc, on the basis of strict equality. Unions in which all officers are directly elected by those they serve and are immediately recallable by the membership. Unions in which remuneration for officers is tied to the average wage of the workers involved; where term limits for officers are strictly observed; and, where the officer returns to the job when their term in office is over. We call this Solidarity Unionism.</li><li>Re-organize the miss-organized of the business unions via establishment of shop-committees that can take direct action on the job in pursuit of workers&rsquo; needs outside of the restrictions of legal collective bargaining agreements. We reject dues check-off because joining a union should be a conscious commitment to solidarity not a &ldquo;condition of employment&rdquo;. We reject no-strike deals because we need to be able to act to defend and extend our rights at every opportunity. We reject &ldquo;management&rsquo;s rights&rdquo; because they are inimical to our own.</li><li>Establish horizontal links between and among unions and shop committees to foster solidarity on a local, regional, national and international level. Build workers&rsquo; centers in every community to reach out to all sectors of the working class and unemployed, including their kids.</li><li>Solidarity Unionism recognizes no restriction on what we should strive for. Health and safety at work, the environmental and social impact of what we produce, shorter and flexible hours of labor, universal health care - everything is fair game! Ultimately, we reject the employing class&rsquo;s so-called &lsquo;proprietary rights&rsquo;. We want to gain control of the means of life!</li> </ol> <p>We offer these ideas in the hope that the new labor movement that will necessarily emerge from the shipwreck known as business unionism can avoid the same mistakes of the past that have led us to the present impasse. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

I.B.B.484 , Meredosia Illinois 62665</p> <p>Email : paul@mail.boilermakers484.org</p> <p>Subject : lockout of I.B.B. 484 </p> <p>Message : This is the information that pertains to the lock out of the Boilermakers L-484 of Meredosia, Illinois. The following information was sent to ICEM. We need to reach out to the world to assist us in putting pressure on Celanese of Dallas Tx. to bargain in good faith and to end the lockout of our members. </p> <p>The members have been without wages since June 5th. I would greatly appreciate it if there is anyway to put out our cause to your readers for support.</p> <p>484 Solidarity - Defense Fund P.O. 258 Meredosia, Illinois 62665 217-584-1916</p> <p>Please contact me for more informtion.</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Paul Craig I.B.B. 484</p> <p> There are 148 employees with average plant age of mid 30s. The employees live in the 5 county bordering the plant.</p> <p>Meredosia is located in western Illinois along the Illinois River. Celanese bought 1/2 our plant ibn Feb 2005. We signed a 120 day extension after the sale and it seems the company was spending more time on their contengency plan than negotiations. Negotiations broke down in the final days after 9 days of non-monetary discussions. The company issued the Lockout notice on June 3 and locked out the membership on June 5 at 9:30 pm. The company is offering to hold the helpers wages flat for the 3 year period of the contract, has insisted on placing our membership in Aetna family for insurance at a rate of 20 % premium union co-pay. The insurance network plans for very limited coverage of doctors in our area. Most families will have to travel up to 50 miles to find a dr. in the network. The offer included retirees to copay for health insurance also and to freeze the pension rate at $48.00 per month per year of service. As most of these proposals are consessionary to our members. We previously had a traditional 90/10 with no premium copays. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_21 first last"><a href="../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-400-manufacture-and-general-product-3/" rel="tag" title="All workers in blast furnaces, steel mills, aluminum plants, etc. All workers engaged in the production and repair of agricultural machinery, cars, locomotives, engines, automobiles, bicycles, air craft, and various instruments.
