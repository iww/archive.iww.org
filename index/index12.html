<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 08/10/2017 - 8:25pm</p>
<p><strong>By X357058, X383824, X373817, X387362 - <a href="https://incarceratedworkers.org/news/coalition-black-trade-unionists-supports-industrial-workers-world" target="_blank">Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee</a>, August 7, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/three_fist.jpg" alt="" align="right" />May 24th &ndash; 29th CBTU International Convention &ndash; New Orleans: The recent work by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) has caught the attention of the <a href="http://www.cbtu.org/" target="_blank">Coalition of Black Trade Unionists</a> (CBTU), bringing their support to the effort to unionize incarcerated workers. At their recent convention in late May the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists voted to support the IWW in the struggle, growing the prisoner unionization movement that has, until now, been overlooked by trade unions. The CBTU brings with it support for the implementation of collective bargaining and a minimum wage for prisoners, which can be viewed as a step toward prison abolition in regards to near-slave labor which prisoners currently perform.</p>
<p>Dee, an IWW member in prison, explains in <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B13-UJjehXaIb2QwZlFHbTRnS1U" target="_blank">an interview</a>, &ldquo;Labor unions can give prisoners more unity and more power to challenge the system that's exploiting prisoners as well as a structure to give prisoners power to resist collectively.The union has a role to play in building the sense of collective power, so that's why George Jackson thought prisoner unions were necessary,&rdquo; Dee states. &ldquo;The demands are many and varied based on conditions in different states and facilities, but take for example the demand for minimum wage, if they're forced to pay prisoners, and we can force their hand, it'll break down the prison system, because the prison system was not based on anything except exploitation of prisoners.&rdquo; Prisoners are currently making between $0.90 and $2.00 per day. Furthermore, the prison population is largely comprised of People of Color currently (~ 66.7%), who make up only 36.3% of the US population.</p>
<p>Within the IWW, the abolitionist oriented <a href="https://incarceratedworkers.org/">Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee</a> (IWOC) is on the cutting edge of the prison labor movement. CBTU&rsquo;s support brings a newfound solidarity to the union, and substantially expands the support base of the union and its project. Brianna Peril, IWOC outside organizer, responded to the news: &ldquo;This is really exciting. One of our strengths as a union is our ability to explain to other union members how important it is that we start recognizing prison slavery as a labor issue. Receiving support from the CBTU is a huge step toward this overarching goal that we had from the founding of IWOC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark Maxey, an IWW member from Oklahoma says, &ldquo;Within the IWW, members seek not only to organize the workplace, but also organize the working class. Whether they are currently employed or not. Many members view this approach as crucial to unions regaining relevance in a rapidly changing job market. The root cause is capitalism and its use of slavery, unemployment, underemployment, and human trafficking. &nbsp;A remedy is to look outside traditional workplaces and outside the box creatively in aspects of the struggles of the working class. &nbsp;This will lead to members of the working class who are jobless or completely alienated from their jobs seeing unions as an answer,&rdquo; Maxey stated.</p>
<p>This remedy could take the form of organizing tenant unions, anti-hate support, clean water coalitions, all sorts of different types of community self-defense networks inside the working class, and especially in the prisons. The CBTU, self-described as &ldquo;the fiercely independent voice of black workers within the trade union movement, challenging organized labor to be more relevant to the needs and aspirations of Black and poor workers&rdquo;, fits well with these ideals of IWW members. IWW proudly calls itself One Big Union. The work of IWOC, aided by CBTU, will ensure that it really is One Big Union.</p>
<p>IWOC was formed in 2014 as a letter-writing program to speak directly to prisoners. Since then, it has already seen a successful <a href="https://incarceratedworkers.org/fire-inside">National Prisoner Strike on September 9th, 2016</a>. This year, the <a href="http://www.iamweubuntu.com/millions-for-prisoners-human-rights.html" target="_blank">Millions for Prisoners March</a> on August 19th will mark the anniversary of George Jackson's death, an early prison organizer whose death lead to the Attica uprising.</p>
<p>CBTU, which was founded in 1972, is the largest, independent voice of more than 2.2 million African American workers in labor unions today. With more than 50 chapters in major U.S. cities and one in Ontario, Canada, CBTU is dedicated to addressing the unique concerns of black workers and their communities. CBTU is a strong supporter of low-wage workers who are fighting for respect and the right to have a voice on their jobs.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Thu, 08/10/2017 - 7:40pm</p>
<p><strong>By Marianne Garneau - <a href="http://blackrosefed.org/uaw-nissan-vote/" target="_blank">Black Rose Anarchist Federation</a>, August 7, 2017<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../sites/default/files/images/nissan-workers.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="213" align="right" />There&rsquo;s been much attention over the reported <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/workers-mississippi-nissan-plant-casting-ballots-union-49027849" target="_blank">loss of a UAW union election</a> at a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi on Friday, August 4th. Many see the organizing effort as part of a larger question of whether the US labor movement can organize in the historically unorganized and union-hostile South. <a href="https://wobblycity.org/" target="_blank">New York City IWW</a> organizer Marianne Garneau writes this brief commentary offering her assessment. <br />
</em></p>
<p>The defeat of a UAW election bid at a Nissan plant in Mississippi got a tremendous amount of attention this week, particularly from the left. People seemed especially disheartened by the defeat, and almost at a loss for why things turned out so badly for the union. Sure enough, the internet produced all kinds of hot, world-historic takes explaining the outcome, a lot of them looking for some kind of exceptional circumstances here. Most zeroed in on the Southern context.</p>
<p>Granted, the union defeat was unfortunate. And it is possible it could have gone another way &ndash; we shouldn&rsquo;t think it was some inevitable outcome (there is way too much fatalism on the left these days). But the reasons why the UAW failed are perfectly legible, and none of them are novel. Everything about the loss &ndash; the union&rsquo;s strategy, the company&rsquo;s union-busting, the social and political context &ndash; was textbook.</p>
<h2>Why the UAW Vote at Nissan Failed</h2>
<p>1. The company union-busted like crazy. And yes, union-busting includes things like playing on racial divisions and threatening people&rsquo;s jobs (these are the sticks), and paying workers high salaries (the carrots). The bosses apparently built a tent outside the plant and met with every single worker on shift, including the ones who weren&rsquo;t even eligible to vote in the election. That&rsquo;s brilliant union-busting, but it&rsquo;s to be expected. That&rsquo;s why unions have a counterstrategy to that, called &ldquo;inoculation,&rdquo; where workers are prepared ahead of time for the boss&rsquo; rhetoric, and their sticks and carrots.</p>
<p>2. The union took a weak-ass, conservative, timid stance of mostly trying to keep the stuff the company was already giving workers and playing nice/reasonable with management. UAW has repeatedly said that it wants to work with companies to help their bottom line healthy, etc. That borrows directly from the boss&rsquo;s logic that they are gifting workers a job and a wage, as opposed to workers generating all the profits the owners get to pocket.</p>
<p>3. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) played its usual role of &ldquo;wot, us?&rdquo; It slowly churned through its processes of listening to complaints from either side. I don&rsquo;t even remember what the outcome was of its rulings (or if it ever got to them). But that&rsquo;s how little that matters to the actual, bloody fight &ldquo;on the shop floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. By the way, none of this has anything to do with &ldquo;the south.&rdquo; What is supposed to be unique here? The fact that other jobs in the area pay terribly? The fact that workers are divided along racial lines? The fact that union density is low? Those are exactly the same conditions that beleaguer workers, and organizing efforts, elsewhere.</p>
<p>5. And yeah, unfortunately, these workers, who presumably voted this way out of fear, and wanting to keep their jobs, will die on their knees as their wages get cut, their jobs get automated or outsourced, or they get replaced by lower-wage temps. You can&rsquo;t &ldquo;play nice&rdquo; or compromise your way to better wages or conditions. Playing nice with the boss means they retain the power to control your wages and your working conditions. The only alternative is to amass real power on the shop floor &ndash; real power to disrupt the flow of profits &ndash; and control how the boss treats you. You can&rsquo;t escape the forces of capitalism inside of one plant, but you can fight like hell over every single site where your labor is exploited for the boss&rsquo;s gain.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t avoid the class war; workers need to make it clear to the bosses that they can&rsquo;t either.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/01/2017 - 7:47pm</p>
<p><strong>Pete Shaw - <a href="http://www.portlandoccupier.org/2017/07/19/11521/" target="_blank"><em>Portland Occupier</em></a>, July 19, 2017</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="../sites/default/files/images/BVWU.jpg" width="320" height="480" align="right" alt="" />The shakes&ndash;blackberry, chocolate hazelnut, and pumpkin spice&ndash;come and go. So do the Walla Walla onion rings, waffle fries, and asparagus. But since April of last year, solidarity has always been in season at Burgerville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its formation 15 months ago, the Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU)&ndash;which is supported by the Portland Industrial Workers of the World&ndash;has been organizing for better working conditions on the job, greater benefits, and higher wages. Fighting against a management that promotes the Burgerville corporation as one which supports family values, local farmers, and sustainable practices, but treats its workers no differently than people have come to expect from larger fast food chains such as McDonald&rsquo;s, the Burgerville Workers Union has slowly but surely been gathering steam in its struggle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Burgerville management has so far refused to talk with the union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday July 14, the BVWU took another small but significant step toward pushing Burgerville&rsquo;s management to start negotiating with it. A crowd of over 100 people picketed outside the Burgerville on Southeast 92</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Powell during the early evening, virtually shutting down business at the store. On a hot night when one of the raspberry shakes would have made a delightful treat, only a few customers crossed the picket line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a rally just prior to establishing the line, Mark Medina of the BVWU told the gathered crowd, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna shut down the shop for a couple of hours and make corporate know that workers care about benefits, about wages, and that they want Burgerville to negotiate with the union and respect the rights of workers here in Portland, Oregon. This is a union town. They should respect our rights to organize.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That lack of respect was given official imprimatur when on June 22 Burgerville agreed to pay $10,000 to settle </span><a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-NOI.pdf" data-slimstat="3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charges brought against it by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BOLI) that between August 1 and August 15, 2015 the company willfully &ldquo;failed to provide a meal period of not less than 30 continuous minutes during which the employee is relieved of all duties and/or failed to provide timely meal periods to twenty-eight employees&rdquo; as required by law. Another 16 employees were also denied their 30-minute work-free meal period during a two-week period in December, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to those charges, BOLI found that Burgerville was &ldquo;employing minors under 18 in hazardous and permitted occupation&rdquo; when two 17 year old employees operated a trash compactor which Oregon law has declared &ldquo;hazardous and detrimental to to the health of employees under the age of 18.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All charges pertained to the Burgerville store on NE Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, near the Oregon Convention Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandon Doyle, BVWU Shop Leader at the SE 92</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Powell Burgerville, is one of many Burgerville workers who has seen the company&rsquo;s scarce regard for workers up close and personal. A few months ago Doyle was feeling ill to the point of vomiting while on the job. Instead of allowing him to go home and rest&ndash;as well as not risk getting Burgerville customers sick&ndash;Doyle&rsquo;s manager insisted he remain at work. Fortunately, Doyle and his fellow workers contacted fellow union members from other stores, who then contacted Doyle&rsquo;s manager, eventually resulting in Doyle being allowed to leave and likely helping prevent the spread of what ailed him. They had his back, and Doyle now wants to return the favor.</span></p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 08/01/2017 - 7:29pm</p>
<p><strong>By Cal - <a href="http://www.dciww.org/2017/07/26/dc-iww-supports-the-tpss-co-op-workers-union-for-15hour-and-a-union/" target="_blank"><em>DC IWW</em></a>, July 30, 2017</strong></p>
<p><img src="../sites/default/files/images/tpssphoto-624x832.jpg" width="320" height="427" align="right" alt="" />The DC General Membership Branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) supports the TPSS Co-op workers in their struggle to unionize. Wages lag behind the rising cost of living in the DC metropolitan area. In Takoma Park, the average cost of living is much higher than in other parts of <a href="http://tpmobilization.org/the-fight-for-15" target="_blank">Maryland</a>, and even a starting salary of $11.50 is unacceptable. A starting wage of $15/hour&ndash;though not ideal&ndash;is a reasonable demand that allows workers the chance to afford rent, transportation, child care and sustenance in one of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the country.</p>
<p>We further support the rights of all workers to unionize, ensuring fair and equitable treatment during these trying times. Moreover, a union will foster a spirit of unity and cooperation among workers so TPSS Co-op can continue to be a place of respect, dignity, and community.</p>
<p>TPSS Co-op is a member-owned cooperative, and the IWW shares many of the the values and goals of the Co-op: a healthy planet, democratic/cooperative ownership, and community-sourced goods and resources. A fully democratically organized workplace is necessary to help strengthen the bonds between the co-op, its workers, its members, and the community at-large. &nbsp;The financial statements, publically available on the TPSS Co-op website, &nbsp;indicate good financial health through growth, profitability, and the ability to consistently meet its obligations. To remain successful, the co-op must also fulfill its obligations of utmost importance &ndash; paying a reasonable wage to its workers and providing improved working conditions.</p>
<p>We encourage the membership, the Board of Representatives, and the greater Takoma Park community to support the workers of the TPSS co-op in creating a truly democratic community.</p>
<p>We believe such a community is in the best interest of everyone and that a productive conversation, centering the workers&rsquo; needs, will build a stronger relationship&ndash;grounded in solidarity&ndash;between the TPSS workers and the Takoma Park Community.</p>
<p>We the membership of the DC General Membership Branch of the IWW hereby fully endorse the efforts of the TPSS Co-op workers&rsquo; union and pledge our support, solidarity and aid to our fellow workers.</p>
