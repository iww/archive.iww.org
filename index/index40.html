<p>This action in solidarity with postal workers is set in a current context of struggles against austerity, and in the scope of the campaign for a social strike on May 1st 2015.</p>
<p>Today, many workers are directly confronted with the effects of budget cuts to health services, to municipal employees, to firemen and firewomen, to postal workers, to students, to workers in the private sector...</p>
<p>Yet, resistance is organizing itself everywhere. We will not let different governments (whether conservative or liberal) and the bosses impose their anti-social measures on us. The time of a minority enriching itself on the back of an impoverished majority is finished.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p>S. was terminated immediately and without cause, which is reprehensible but legal in Ontario within a probationary period. During her 6 months-less-two-days at Syme Woolner, S. had advocated for better treatment of workers and against discrimination and disrespect of workers and service users. She was the third person to occupy her position in less than a year.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p>Last Thursday we had a fantastic, loud demonstration outside Friends House. The Quaker boss, Recording Clerk Paul Parker, refused to come out and meet us (more on this soon), so we'll be back this week to up the ante.</p>
<p>Management&rsquo;s tactic so far has been to ignore us and hope the problem will disappear, so we intend to make this difficult by being as loud and as visible as possible.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.

<p>London&rsquo;s busy Leicester Square was the scene on Saturday, January 17th, for a picket organised by the IWW London general membership branch with the support of the Angry Language Brigade. The Leicester Square School of English (LSSE) was closed down over the Christmas period leaving workers out of work and out of pocket.</p>
<p>Workers decided to occupy the workplace in the hope of getting the money that they&rsquo;re owed in unpaid wages, holiday pay and redundancy. Whilst they were there a group of students arrived expecting to be taught English only to find that the school had closed. The bosses had taken their money and not told them they were closing the school down. The workers have helpfully provided information for any students that turn up in future.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
