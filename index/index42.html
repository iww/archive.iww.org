<p><b>By Ron Kaminkow - <a href="http://labornotes.org/blogs/2015/01/rail-workers-and-environmentalists-teach-each-other" target="_blank"><em>Labor Notes</em></a>, January 21, 2015 </b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <em>The views expressed here are not the official position of the IWW (or even the IWW&rsquo;s EUC) and do not necessarily represent the views of anyone but the author&rsquo;s. Several IWW branches have, however, endorsed this effort.<br />
</em></p>
<p><img width="320" height="239" align="right" src="../sites/default/files/images/BombTrainBuffett1.jpg" alt="" />With public attention focused on the railroads in a way it hasn&rsquo;t been for decades, the cross-craft solidarity group Railroad Workers United is seizing the opportunity to teach the general public &ldquo;railroading 101&rdquo;&mdash;and teach rail workers &ldquo;environmental politics 101.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both those workshops, among others, will be offered at one-day conferences on &ldquo;The Future of Railroads: Safety, Workers, Community, and Environment,&rdquo; March 14 in Richmond, California, and March 21 in Olympia, Washington. (See below) for details.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;My excitement about the conference is having railroaders, who on a daily basis are moving these really dangerous, volatile, flammable materials, having a dialogue with communities who want it to be made safe,&rdquo; says activist Gifford Hartman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my knowledge it&rsquo;s never been done,&rdquo; says Seattle switchman-conductor Jen Wallis. &ldquo;Rail labor hasn&rsquo;t worked with environmentalists to the degree that steelworkers and longshoremen and Teamsters have. It&rsquo;s all very new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RWU is partnering with the Backbone Campaign and other groups to organize both events. The idea is to bring together rank-and-filers, environmentalists, and the general public.</p>
<p>Just as important as learning each other&rsquo;s issues, Wallis says, is that &ldquo;we get to know each other&hellip; So we have people we can call on when we have an issue on the table, and they can do the same with us.&rdquo;</p>

The cops grabbed IWW member Jason by the throat, threw him on the ground and pinned him partially under a car.

<p>There&rsquo;s a hidden underside to Santa Monica, California&rsquo;s idyllic exterior.</p>
<p>Santa Monica is a beautiful beachfront city: breezes from the Pacific Ocean, a year-round Mediterranean climate, 3.5 miles of beaches. Seven million visitors a year flock here&mdash;generating $1.63 billion.</p>
<p>But the workers who maintain the city are hired on an as-needed basis, earning poverty-level wages, lacking benefits and the ability to form a union.</p>
<p>I am one of them. I&rsquo;ve been employed as a temporary employee in beach bathroom maintenance for four years. I struggle to earn a living and hold an extra job so I can earn enough money to survive.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
