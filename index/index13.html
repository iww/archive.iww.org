<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 07/25/2017 - 7:22pm</p>
<p><strong>By the members of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midatlanticgdc.com/j20_defense_campaign_goes_global?recruiter_id=563">Mid Atlantic General Defense Committee</a></strong><strong>, July 20, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em>This past week, <strong><a target="_blank" title="J20 Letter" href="http://www.midatlanticgdc.com/letter">our J20 campaign</a></strong> not only received endorsements from more unions and organizations across the country, but from multiple European unions as well.&nbsp; As we approach the J20 Week of Solidarity July 20-27 organized by <strong><a target="_blank" title="Defend J20 Resistance" href="http://defendj20resistance.org/">Defend J20 Resistance</a></strong>, we're happy to have this boost of energy and support!</em></p>
<h3><strong>Endorsement Update </strong></h3>
<p>This past week or so, we received endorsements from multiple IWW branches such as those in <strong><a target="_blank" title="Baltimore IWW" href="https://www.facebook.com/IWW-Baltimore-97451807925/">Baltimore, Maryland</a> </strong>and <strong><a target="_blank" title="Tampa Bay IWW" href="https://www.facebook.com/IWWTampa/">Tampa, Florida</a></strong>.&nbsp; In addition, we received endorsements from the <strong><a target="_blank" title="Metro DC Socialist Party" href="https://www.facebook.com/MetroDCSP/">Washington, D.C. branch of the Socialist Party, USA</a></strong>, and the <strong><a target="_blank" title="SeaSol" href="http://www.seasol.net/">Seattle Solidarity Network</a></strong>, commonly known as SeaSol.&nbsp; SeaSol has long been an inspiration for many of us in forming the GDC, so we wanted to give a particular shout out to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/midatlanticgdc/pages/24/attachments/original/1500389082/shuler-picket1.jpg?1500389082" alt="shuler-picket1.jpg" width="410" height="230" /></p>
<p>If you haven't encountered SeaSol before, you should do yourself a favor and <strong><a target="_blank" title="SeaSol" href="http://www.seasol.net/">check them out</a></strong>--they're a &quot;volunteer network of working people who defend each other through collective action,&quot; who have amassed an impressive list of victories fighting for tenants' and workers' rights in Seattle over the past decade.&nbsp; Their amazing successes have led to similar groups elsewhere, and has shown a working, democratic model of how working people can take action to fight against abusive bosses and landlords.&nbsp; We're really thrilled that they've endorsed our letter!</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 07/18/2017 - 8:36pm</p>
<p><strong>By Sadie Farrell and M.K. Lees - <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/2017/07/10/the-fourth-star-the-new-junior-wobblies-and-the-next-generation-of-union-militants-by-sadie-farrell-and-m-k-lees/" target="_blank">Institute for Anarchist Studies</a>, July 10, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em>Several factors played into our collective decision not to run a print issue of </em>Perspectives on Anarchist Theory<em> for the current year. We sincerely thank all inquiries and submissions sent for what was hoped to be an issue on Play. A call out for submissions for a Beyond The Crisis print issue of </em>Perspectives<em> (2018) will be announced shortly.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This is an article written by two Wobblies in response to our call for Play essays. These organizers bridge the gap between play and the practice of organizing skills via educational skits and fun activities led by the New Junior Wobblies, the young members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).</em></p>
<p><em>The IWW globe logo holds three stars representing Education, Organization and Emancipation.&nbsp;This article looks at Recreation &ndash; a &nbsp;fourth star &ndash; from challenging uneven relations of power, to making joy central to organizing against capitalism,&nbsp;regardless of age.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Shortly after a wave of government repression and internal splits nearly destroyed the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as a functioning labor organization, a group of Wobblies felt the immediate need to find new ways to raise the next generation of revolutionary unionists.&nbsp; As a part of solidarity support for striking IWW coal miners in Colorado, children of union members were invited to join an IWW organization of their own.&nbsp; These Wobbly kids formed &ldquo;locals&rdquo; to organize support for their striking parents, and alongside them, develop a rudimentary understanding of the world and how they might soon be a part of organizing to change it.&nbsp; To the IWW tripartite motto, &ldquo;Education, Organization, Emancipation&rdquo; they added &ldquo;Recreation,&rdquo; and in 1927, the Junior Wobblies Union was born.</p>

<p>This effort to formally carve out a space for children in the IWW was lost as the union fell into obscurity, but with the IWW revival of the past few decades, old traditions have been revived.&nbsp; In 2011, the Twin Cities branch of the IWW reconstituted both the self-educational institution, the Work People&rsquo;s College, as well as the Junior Wobblies.&nbsp; It began as a combination of IWW members coordinating childcare to enable parents to attend trainings, panels, and other IWW events.&nbsp; But as the network of Wobblies with kids grew, so did the desire to provide concrete ways for kids to engage with union activity.</p>
<p>In July, 2012, the Twin Cities put on the first Junior Wobblies summer camp in decades, hosting IWW children ages 2 through 12 at Mesaba Park campground for a week of games, outdoor play, and structured learning activities.&nbsp; The camp has continued annually ever since, drawing a larger crowd from across the US and Canada each year.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Tue, 07/18/2017 - 8:28pm</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>By staff - <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/2017/07/burgerville-pays-10000-to-settle-wage-and-hour-violations/" target="_blank"><em>NW Labor Press</em></a>, July 6, 2017</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The Burgerville fast food chain &mdash; target of a 14-month union campaign to improve wages and working conditions &mdash; on June 22 agreed to pay $10,000 to settle charges that it willfully failed to give workers meal and rest breaks as required by law.</p>
<p class="p1 rteleft"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11554" src="../sites/default/files/images/BWU-logo-black_0.png" width="263" height="300" align="right" alt="" />Oregon law requires employers to provide paid rest periods of at least 10 minutes for each four-hour work period, and a duty-free meal period of at least 30 minutes when employees work six or more hours at a time.</p>
<p class="p1">The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) first <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BOLIletterToBV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> to Burgerville on April 7, 2016, saying it received information that the company may not have been providing rest breaks and meal periods at its Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard restaurant in Portland. The letter asked the company to review its practices and take immediate steps to correct the situation. Burgerville&rsquo;s chief operating officer <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BVletterToBOLI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote back</a> April 18 to say the company had retrained the entire management team and would meet with all 40 employees to make sure they know about the requirement that they take breaks.</p>
<p class="p1">But the practice continued: Two other employees complained in August, and BOLI sent another letter, and opened an investigation. The investigation found that over two-week periods in August and December 2016, managers &ldquo;willfully&rdquo; failed to provide meal periods to 28 and 16 employees respectively. Willful, in this case, is a legal term meaning the company knew about the requirement for meal breaks, and also knew that workers weren&rsquo;t getting them. The agency <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-NOI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> 44 violations total, and assessed $250 per violation, for $11,000 in all. BOLI also found three cases in which minors were performing a hazardous duty &mdash; operating a trash compactor &mdash; and assessed $250 per violation for those.</p>
<p class="p1">On June 2, 2017, the agency issued a notice that it intended to assess civil penalties of $11,750. The Vancouver-based fast food chain <a href="https://nwlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/55-17-Burgerville-FOID-w-Agreed-Settlement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to pay $10,000 to settle all the charges.</p>
<p class="p1">Burgerville Workers Union, affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World, has been campaigning since April 2016 for a $5 an hour raise, affordable health care, and other demands. The Oregon AFL-CIO and half a dozen other labor organizations have endorsed their campaign.</p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 06/28/2017 - 7:38pm</p>
<p><strong>By Mid Atlantic General Defense Committee - <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/letter-j20-defense-campaign-mid-atlantic-gdc/" target="_blank"><em>It's Going Down</em></a>, June 27, 2017</strong></p>
<p><em><img src="../sites/default/files/images/gdc-banner-freezing.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="180" align="right" />PDF Version </em><strong><a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/midatlanticgdc/pages/18/attachments/original/1498512767/J20DefenseLetter.pdf?1498512767" target="_blank">Here</a></strong></p>
<h5><strong>Looking for a solidarity statement&nbsp;that you can take to your union, local organization, or faith based group to sign and build a base of support for J20 arrestees facing repression? The Mid-Atlantic General Defense Committee of the IWW has created one along with a<a href="http://www.midatlanticgdc.com/petition" target="_blank">&nbsp;petition for individuals to sign here.</a></strong></h5>
<p>On January 20, 2017, thousands took to the streets of Washington, D.C., to protest the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. During one of the many marches held on Inauguration Day, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department showed the world how it planned to treat dissent moving forward: Shortly after the protest began, hundreds of protesters were attacked with pepper spray, rubber bullets, and batons. Police confined over 200 people within a &ldquo;kettle&rdquo; for hours before arresting them. Every protester&rsquo;s cell phone was confiscated as evidence and rooted through. Upon being released, they were handed a riot charge. Months later, US attorneys piled on 8 additional felony charges, including &ldquo;Conspiracy to Riot&rdquo;. Protesters now face up to 75 years in prison &ndash; all for attending a demonstration.</p>
<p>Among the people arrested were over two dozen members of our union, the Industrial Workers of the World, and its affiliated legal defense and community organizing body, the IWW General Defense Committee (GDC). Within the IWW and GDC, we don&rsquo;t shy away from our members&rsquo; politics, and support our members&rsquo; rights to express their politics through protests and marches, a tradition that goes back within our union to battles over free speech in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Since the arrests, D.C. prosecutors and police have shown a disturbing pattern of repression as well as specific targeting of IWW and GDC members. Our members had their union cards and buttons confiscated and held as evidence. Months after the protest, three individuals (including two prominent members of the DC IWW local branch) were served with warrants for their arrest on charges of conspiracy to riot. Prior to their warrants being issued, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office revealed that they had created separate trial groupings, including one grouping where nearly all defendants were IWW or GDC members. While they will not say as much in public, it has become clear that the city attorneys for Washington, D.C. are treating membership in our union as evidence of a criminal act.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the IWW has been targeted for repression, and it is unlikely to be the last. The crackdown on protesters in D.C. is part of a larger effort to criminalize and silence dissent in working-class and marginalized communities. D.C. is just one of more than a dozen states that are attempting to quell dissent through legislation or harsh legal penalties. This is not a coincidence. <strong>People in power want activists and <strong>organizations to be afraid to protest Trump&rsquo;s agenda.</strong></strong></p>
<p>The labor movement cannot succeed if union members are treated as criminals when protesting anti-union and anti-worker politicians and their policies. No social movement can operate in repressive conditions like that. We have always stood by the principle that &ldquo;an injury to one is an injury to all.&rdquo; In this spirit, we are calling on our friends and allies in the labor movement, as well as in allied progressive or left groups, to share this letter and pass the following motion within your union local or organization<strong>:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>We are deeply concerned about the severe repression against all protesters facing charges for exercising their First Amendment rights on January 20, 2017 in Washington, D.C.
