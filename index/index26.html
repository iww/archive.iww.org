<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/27/2016 - 12:49am</p>
<p><b>By 6eoff - <a target="_blank" href="http://iwwboston.org/2016/01/25/wobs-instrumental-in-getting-workers-job-back/">Boston IWW</a>, January 25, 2016</b></p>
<p><img width="320" height="214" align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/img_6910.jpg" />Pictured are MISU&rsquo;s John P (recently reinstated), Evan and John M, as well as Genevieve, Geoff, Max and Jon from the Boston IWW.</p>
<p>IWW members returned to aid our friends and fellow workers in the Museum Independent Security Union on 1/23/16. Despite freezing temperatures, our hearts were warmed by a message from John M of MISU, who conveyed his belief that IWW support was &ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; in getting unfairly-fired MISU member John P re-hired with no discipline and with back pay. John P was fired by Boston&rsquo;s Museum of Fine Arts merely for fulfilling his responsibilities as a parent. The outcry that followed (which Boston wobs are proud have helped with) compelled the museum to take John back. The MFA has been forcing working parents out of their jobs and taking a hard line in contract negotiations with MISU, and the battle is not over yet. Please join the Boston IWW and MISU for pickets at the Museum of Fine Arts, Saturdays from 12-2 pm.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/27/2016 - 12:26am</p>
<p><b>By a member of the <a href="http://ottawaiww.org/?p=940" target="_blank">Ottawa-Outaouais IWW</a>, January 23, 2016</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img align="right" src="../sites/default/files/WineRack.jpg" alt="" />OTTAWA&mdash;The Industrial Workers of the World are picketing Wine Rack to defend a member unfairly fired on September 6, 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our member engaged in his legally-protected right to organize and was publicly engaged in a card-signing campaign by another union in efforts to certify a bargaining unit for Wine Rack locations in Ottawa, Ontario.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wine Rack is owned by parent company Constellation Brands, a US-based multinational corporation with two billion dollars of profit in 2013. Front-line employees of Wine Rack are paid minimum wage and given only conditional yearly increases lower than the rate of inflation, compounding the difficulties posed by a part-time and unpredictable schedule for workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to the Labour Relations Act, all workers have the right to form, select, and administer a union without interference from the employer. In response to our member&rsquo;s organizing efforts, Wine Rack manufactured a spurious reason to terminate his employment without following their established disciplinary processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The IWW will continue to picket Wine Rack to demand fair treatment for our member until our demand for our member&rsquo;s reinstatement on the job with back pay is met. All employees deserve to be able to organize without reprisal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The IWW is calling on Ottawans to not cross our picket line and to respect a boycott of Wine Rack locations until management meets with our union to negotiate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is yet another instance of arbitrary firings and disrespect for the Labour Relations Act happening here in Ottawa. Workers can win these fights when they unite and take action. The IWW is a member-run union for all workers and is dedicated to organizing on the job.</p>

<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/27/2016 - 12:16am</p>
<p><b>By FW W.H. Glazer - <a target="_blank" href="http://tcorganizer.com/2016/01/20/on-voting-by-fw-w-h-glazer/">Twin Cities IWW</a>, January 20, 2016</b></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b><img width="400" height="296" align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/images/voting.jpg" />Introduction</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Every four years, Americans are subjected to a painfully long election cycle. It is January of a presidential election year, and that means that we can anticipate another ten months of mainstream media coverage that manages to simultaneously overwhelm us with its volume and leave us with no novel or useful information (did you know, for example, that Dr. Ben Carson was a rageful and violent nerd growing up in Detroit? Or that Donald Trump is a shameless blowhard whose racist, classist, and sexist rhetoric appeals to a sizeable group of racists, classists, and sexists?). My boss loves to play CNN in the office as background noise, but my proximity to the television means that I know a lot more about Martin O&rsquo;Malley and Carly Fiorina than I ever needed to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Inherent in the decision to enact non-stop coverage is an assumption that all of this election stuff really matters, that who you support and ultimately vote for can have a tangible effect on the lives of millions of people. We are taught from a young age that our right to vote is a tremendously precious one, and further that failure to participate in the election process is a failure of civic duty. We are Americans, god dammit, and it is our responsibility to uphold justice and liberty and democracy through our voting process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">From a pragmatic standpoint, there is actually some truth to this idea. It is, from a purely practical point of view, smart to vote for the lesser of two evils. Hillary Clinton is less likely to impose anti-Muslim immigration reforms than is Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders is considerably less scary and objectionable than are the cackling hyenas who comprise the Republican field. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the IWW, though, we can&rsquo;t only think in terms of pragmatism and practicality. We are a revolutionary anti-capitalist union, and it can be convincingly argued that active participation in electoral politics is not only counterproductive for our organizational goals, but counter-revolutionary. After all, no major party candidate will ever advocate for the dissolution of our capitalist economy and the establishment of a worker run society. Voting third party in a presidential race may be more morally justifiable, but barring tremendous social and political upheaval, a third party candidate will never take the White House.</span></p>

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Wed, 01/27/2016 - 12:03am</p>
<p><b>By the <a target="_blank" href="http://lifelongwobbly.com/2016/01/18/workers-power-against-police-brutality-and-racist-terror-2/">Life Long Wobbly</a> - January 18, 2016</b></p>
<h2>The Chicago Teachers Step Up &ndash; What does it mean?</h2>
<p><img width="320" height="178" align="right" alt="" src="../sites/default/files/tciww-african-peoples-caucus.png" />The decision of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) to participate in the Black Friday <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20151126/streeterville/teachers-union-join-black-friday-mag-mile-laquan-mcdonald-protest">protests against police brutality</a> is an important step forward, advancing both the struggle against the Chicago police department, and allowing the CTU to flex its muscles before the end of its contract. Chicago Teachers voted overwhelmingly to support a strike in their recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/chicago-teachers-union-strike-rahm-emanuel-laquan-mcdonald/">strike authorization vote</a>, and if they can win another strike as they did in 2012, it would be an incredibly important victory for the working class around the country. It would show that education workers can fight and win, especially if they have united with the broader working class around issues such as institutional racism.</p>
<p>The simmering rage against Chicago&rsquo;s blatantly racist, terrorist, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/chicago-cops-detained-7-000-secret-interrogation-center-article-1.2404256">secret prison-operating</a> police department provides an important backdrop. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.revivingthestrike.org/">US anti-labor law illegitimately limits what workers can strike over</a>; if the teachers go on strike, and demand the removal of police from school campuses, or defunding of the police force, that would make their strike &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; in the eyes of the state. Chicago teachers have an important choice. Even if the teachers go on strike and don&rsquo;t say a word about the police, the CPD is intimately tied to Rahm Emanuel&rsquo;s austerity regime, and a teachers&rsquo; strike could strengthen and build on the movement against police brutality and terror. However, if the teachers do explicitly include anti-police demands in their strike, and stick by them even when threatened with injunction, they could really inspire the rest of the working class in Chicago to mobilize and support them. A victory in that case would also show that workers can successfully take on the system of anti-labor laws in this country, particularly those which declare certain kinds of strikes &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Could teachers and other education workers strike to remove police from schools? Nothing could stop them from putting this into their demands. If a teachers union prioritized &ldquo;cops off campus&rdquo;, and waged a strike on the level of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/teachers-strike-chicago-explained">Chicago in 2012</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/heres-why-seattle-teacheres-are-strike">Seattle earlier this year</a>, this would be a massive step forward. This would be particularly powerful to the degree that it spread beyond the teachers to include other education workers. Of course, any industrial action for &ldquo;cops off campus&rdquo; would meet bitter resistance from the city administration, at the same time that the national media, the Democratic Party, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; the national unions would stop at nothing to sabotage this action, and force or cajole the workers into moderating their demands.</p>
<p>This is why militant education workers would have to prepare for this struggle, beginning by consciously identifying with the victims of police brutality, against the police rather than with them. An initiative to strike for &ldquo;cops off campus&rdquo; might need years before education workers actually have the strength and organization to pull it off &ndash; but the situation in the US over the last several years has also been very fluid, and things could develop much quicker than we might expect.</p>
