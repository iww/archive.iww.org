INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD STATEMENT ON WISCONSIN SB 11 AND THE DEMONSTRATION IN MADISON <br />
<br />
The Industrial Workers of the World stands in solidarity with all public and private sector workers in the state of Wisconsin during this trying time. The Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, is attempting to close a 137 million dollar budget gap at the expense of the rights of state employees; effectively eliminating collective bargaining and destroying public sector unions. This bill is nothing less than a slap in the face to people who have dedicated their lives to serving the state and its people. <br />

</h2>
<p class="submitted">Submitted on Sat, 02/19/2011 - 11:42pm</p>
<p><img width="172" height="227" align="right" src="../graphics/sabocats/gdcsabcat.gif" alt="" />Right now in Wisconsin public workers from across the state, supported by private sector workers, students young and old, retirees, labor activists and more, are holding unprecedented protests in Madison against the utterly dictatorial move by Governor Scott Walker to gut their collective bargaining rights.</p>
<p>After giving $140 million to special interest groups in January, many of whom donated to Republican campaigns and to the Governor himself, Walker is now attempting to strip Wisconsin's state workers of their hard-won right to collectively bargain over the conditions of their labor under the guise of filling a claimed $137 million budget shortfall.</p>
<p>A similar bill has been introduced in Ohio, and Republican Sen. Jane Cunningham in Missouri has also introduced a bill to strip state law of all Child Labor protections.</p>
<p>In light of these increasing attacks on the working class, We, the Steering Committee and Central Secretary Treasurer of the General Defense Committee of the Industrial Workers of the World, stand firmly behind all workers fighting back. We extend Solidarity to all workers, union or non-union, fighting back against the Capitalist class trying to return us to conditions not found since the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>As our primary mission is to offer solidarity and defense help to any workers imprisoned, arrested, attacked, or punished by the State in any way in fighting the class war, the GDC of the IWW is here to offer any and all help we can during these times, and during all labor struggles.An injury to one is an injury to ALL!</p>
<p>Solidarity Forever! <br />
Signed,</p>
<p>Central Secretary-Treasurer: <br />
Steven Ayers</p>
<p>Steering Committee: <br />
Chuck Bailey <br />

<p>Madison, Wisconsin - Industrial Workers of the World<br />
Emergency Mid-West Meeting<br />
Madison Labor Temple<br />
1602 South Park Street<br />
Madison, WI 53715<br />
2:30pm - 2nd Floor<br />
<br />
At present, people are on the streets and in the Capital 24/7. The Tea Party will be at the capital on Saturday February 19 from noon-3pm. The Democrats have fled the state and a stalemate is ensuring.<br />
<br />
Please consider coming this weekend and giving public workers the support they need. We will be making best use of the time that the Democrats have given us by holding an emergency meeting. We are expecting this situation to continue, allowing time for a deeper analysis. We are asking members to understand that we are working with the militant tendencies with-in the existing unions and asserting our perspectives when appropriate. This may be the half way point but it may also be the beginning. The situation is developing steady by itself but we need to direct it towards empowering the rank-n-filers. We will be developing short term strategies to push this forward and long term plans for support.<br />
<br />
This will be a chaired meeting that is open to the public but you must have your red card to vote or pass motions. Delegates will be on hand to sign people up and pay dues up. There is a parking lot at the Labor Temple and the room can fit 70 people. We'll have a couple of guest speakers to brief the membership and bring them up to speed on the current events.<br />
<br />
For those who can not come please consider supporting the Madison IWW financially.<br />

Right now we are working on housing and logistical issues. Please contact Marty for housing at: mjk-333@att.net<br />
