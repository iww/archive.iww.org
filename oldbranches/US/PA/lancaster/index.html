      <P align=left><FONT color=#000000>The working class and the employing 
      class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and 
      want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make 
      up the employing class, have all the good things of life.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#000000>Between these two classes a struggle 
      must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take 
      possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live 
      in harmony with the Earth.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#000000>We find that the centering of the 
      management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions 
      unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing class. The 
      trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to 
      be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby 
      helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid 
      the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the 
      working class have interests in common with their employers.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#000000>These conditions can be changed and the 
      interest of the working class upheld only by an organization formed in 
      such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries 
      if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any 
      department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to 
      all.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#000000>Instead of the conservative motto, "A 
      fair day's wage for a fair day's work," we must inscribe on our banner the 
      revolutionary watchword, "Abolition of the wage system."</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT color=#000000>It is the historic mission of the 
      working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be 
      organized, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to 
      carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By 
      organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society 
      within the shell of the old.</FONT></P></DIV></TD>

      <P><FONT color=#000000>We are teachers, dishwashers, techies, musicians, 
      factory workers, bicycle messengers - membership crosses most
