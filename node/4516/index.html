<img src="../../graphics/IU630/Shattuck/640_3-27-06thru9-1-06290.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="197" align="right" />As members of the Starbucks Workers Union, we believe that the need for
workplace organizing is greater than ever before ; behind each shiny
logo lies a potential struggle. Since the mid-1970s bosses have been on
the offensive : battering workers with inflation, union busting,
outsourcing, industrial restructuring, and the destruction of the last
shreds of the social safety net. The result of these shifts can be
summed up as the rise of &quot;precarity&quot; as the defining fact of life for
an ever-growing section of the working class.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Precariat : An Impossible Class<br />
</strong>
<br />
More than anything, precarity describes the everyday life experience of
workers in the corporate chains. It is simply impossible to make a life
for yourself working one of these jobs. Because of the lack of union
organization in these industries, we are almost all legally classified
as &quot;At Will&quot; employees. This means that under U.S. labor law, we can be
fired for no reason. The threat of firing, however, is only the least
subtle of many mechanisms used by management to control us.<br />
<br />
At Starbucks, many workers have difficulty budgeting or planning ahead
because our work hours fluctuate wildly from week to week. The company
uses a computer system to determine staffing levels for the stores
based on past sales. Starbucks’ &quot;Automated Labor Scheduling&quot; software
displaces almost all of the risk of the vagaries of the market onto
individual workers. Bosses order &quot;labor&quot; exactly like they order coffee
beans or other inputs. When workers challenge the arbitrary authority
of their boss they often face punitive measures, such as cuts in hours.
But we are not coffee beans, we are human beings ! By organizing, we
assert our humanity in a system founded on our commodification.<br />
<br />
The corporate chains have proven almost as difficult to organize as
they are hellish to work in. In fact, many industries were restructured
with the explicit goal of reducing workers’ power. Workers are broken
into small groups at numerous, networked production sites, which are
all monitored closely for signs of subversion. There are very few
&quot;chokehold&quot; points where industrial action can shut down a corporate
chain. But it rarely even gets that far ; union busting is now fully
integrated into the day-to-day operations of &quot;Human Resources&quot;
departments in the corporate chains. Rather than fight a union drive
once it has been initiated, corporations create &quot;union avoidance&quot;
programs to prevent workers from being able to organize in the first
place.<br />
<br />
The corporate chains will not settle for putting down workers’ revolts
; they seek to stamp out the potential of revolt once and for all by
destroying the historical subject of the working class itself. There
are no &quot;workers&quot; in the corporate chains : at Starbucks we are
&quot;partners,&quot; at IKEA we are &quot;Coworkers,&quot; and at Wal-Mart we are
&quot;Associates.&quot; Once everyone is assumed to be on the same team, workers
are encouraged to compete with each other for advancement within the
company, which in turn is supposed to advance the company on the market.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, the culture of solidarity built by the working class
movements of the 19th and 20th centuries is being undermined by an
ethos of mutual suspicion, snitching, and cutthroat competition. The
bosses want us to think that the only way out of precarity is by
becoming a boss.<br />
<br />
This is the geography of today’s working class : underpaid, overworked,
under surveillance, flung across networked production sites on multiple
continents, always on the move, desperate, always scrambling for the
next foothold. As organizers, it is on this terrain we must learn to
walk.<br />
<br />
For the last four years, the IWW Starbucks Workers Union has taken a
few steps down this path. The experiences of our union can serve as
valuable indicators for the pitfalls, potential, and necessity of
organizing through precarity against the corporate chains.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our Origins</strong><br />
<br />
The Starbucks Workers Union was founded on May 2004 at a single store
in New York City. With the help of a website and the extensive network
of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), organizing has gone
public in Chicago, Maryland, and Grand Rapids. Baristas are also
self-organizing under-the-radar across the world.<br />
<br />
From the outset, it became clear that the government-sponsored system
of union elections would not work in a corporate chain environment.
When baristas at the 36th and Madison Starbucks in New York City filed
for a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election, Starbucks reacted
by using its political clout to gerrymander the bargaining unit from
one pro-union store to include every store in midtown and downtown
Manhattan. Seeing the writing on the wall, IWW baristas pulled their
election petition and have eschewed the election tactic ever since.<br />
<br />
For the AFL-CIO or &quot;Change to Win&quot; unions this would have been the end
of the campaign ; for the IWW, this was just the beginning. Our
subsequent organizing approach can be described as a combination of two
strategies : the &quot;Ground War&quot; and the &quot;Air War.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>The Ground War : Solidarity Unionism<br />
</strong>
<br />
What does it take to fan the flames of discontent in any corporate
workplace into a fire hot enough to withstand the union busting, high
turnover rates, and manipulative socio-psychological techniques of
retail management ? In the Starbucks Workers Union, we have adopted an
approach known as Solidarity Unionism. The essence of this organizing
model it its underlying power analysis. We believe workers’ power is
greatest where the bosses need us most : on the shop floor.<br />
<br />
Instead of relying solely on the inadequate provisions of the National
Labor Relations Act (NLRA), we encourage workers to build solidarity
with their coworkers and take direct action on the job. This takes the
form of confrontations with managers in the stores, petitions, picket
lines, slowdowns, walkouts, work stoppages, amongst other tactics.<br />
<br />
While the above tactics are powerful, building solidarity with amongst
Starbucks workers is hard work. Because of constant turnover building a
memory of struggle amongst an informal work group is nearly impossible.
When conditions deteriorate, most workers simply move on to another
low-wage job. Constant surveillance prevents open discussion of
workplace issues or past action. Even if a committee is successfully
organized in one shop, there remains the challenge of reaching out to
workers in other locations whom you have almost no contact with. In the
face of these odds, the IWW Starbucks Workers Union has still
successfully organized numerous job actions in New York, Chicago, and
other cities. These actions have resulted in critical health and safety
improvements, reinstatement of fired workers, and a 25% pay raise iThe
Air War : Corporate Campaigningn the New York City market.<br />
<br />
However, the above list of victories does not touch on the most
valuable result of our struggle : its transformative effect on workers.
The primary goal of direct action is to win concrete gains and build
industrial power, but for many of us, the most inspiring result of
solidarity unionism is its transformative effect on workers.<br />
<br />
Through organizing, we catch a glimpse of the world we would like to
create. Workers who once watched the world pass them by from behind a
cash register begin taking control over their surroundings. People who
once turned a blind eye to their fellow workers’ suffering break the
silence and speak out for justice. Workers make nationalism obsolete
through organizing down the supply chain to coffee suppliers, and
through direct support from sympathetic organizations and individuals
worldwide. For example, the French CNT occupied the lobbies of several
Paris Starbucks to protest the illegal firing of Starbucks worker
Daniel Gross in 2006. In 2007, a delegation of New York City baristas
traveled to Ethiopia to make contact with hyper-exploited coffee
farmers. Through tireless organizing and outreach, our resistance is as
local as the coffee shop next door, and it is becoming as global as
capital.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Air War : Corporate Campaigning<br />
</strong>
<br />
The Starbucks Workers Union has augmented shop floor organizing with an
extensive effort to reveal the truth behind the brand. Widespread
popular misconceptions about the working conditions at Starbucks mean
that we must constantly explain the necessity of organizing a union at
this 100% part-time poverty-wage employer. We are eager to engage in
public debate on this subject. The management-promoted liberal
discourse of &quot;social responsibility&quot; has undermined the support of
higher-paid sectors of the working class for the workers’ movement in
general. By winning the debate on the necessity of organizing at
Starbucks, we hope to open the door to a much broader social awareness
of the need for workers to organize everywhere, not just at Wal-Mart or
another vilified exploiter-du-jour.<br />
<br />
In the last analysis, Starbucks’ brand image is an enormous asset to
our union campaign. Their rhetoric allows us to hold them accountable
to their own proclaimed values like &quot;dignity and respect.&quot; In addition,
because the company has cultivated such a high awareness of their
brand, we are able to piggyback on their own public relations efforts
to broaden awareness of our union, and union organizing is general. By
organizing a highly visible industry leader, we are able to lay the
foundations for a much broader working class offensive.<br />
<br />
<strong>Two, Three, Many Starbucks Workers Unions !<br />
</strong>
<br />
Will the revolution start at a Starbucks ? In a sense, it already has.
It will take a social earthquake on the scale of the Civil Rights
movement to defeat precarity, but we have to start small. The IWW
Starbucks Workers Union receives a steady flow of new members through
its website. These members are then trained by IWW organizers to reach
out to their coworkers and begin building power on the job. Every job
action, every organizing committee meeting, every conversation between
two angry workers on a cigarette break, every group confrontation with
the boss : these are the first tremors of the next cycle of workers’
struggle.<br />
<br />
What would happen if workers organized at every Starbucks in the world
? What if workers organized at every corporate chain in the world ?
What kind of demands would we articulate ? What kind of world would the
millions of our brothers and sisters held captive behind corporate
logos be able to create ? It is our desire to know the answer to these
questions that keeps us walking this path.<br />
