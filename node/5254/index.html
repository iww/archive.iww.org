<p><img src="../../graphics/agitators/classic/clocksm1.jpg" align="right" />When miners get tired of being buried alive for them, the few.</p>
<p>When keyboard pounders get tired of wearing their hands out for them, the few.</p>
<p>When the truckers get tired of the weariness of driving endlessly for them, the few.</p>
<p>When fast food workers get tired of producing large quantities of food quickly at near starvation wages for them, the few.</p>
<p>When women workers get tired of being paid less and used as sex objects for them, the few.</p>
<p>When farm workers get tired of picking the food for all to eat while being poisoned and not having enough to eat themselves for them, the few.</p>
<p>When workers of color get tired of racism and having to labor in the worst jobs for them, the few.</p>
<p>When hospital workers get tired of working for the profit of the bosses, caring for the sick and injured for long hours for them, the few.</p>
<p>When construction workers get tired of building the homes and buildings of society under dangerous conditions for them, the few.
</p><p>When child workers get tired of producing the latest fashion statements of the rich while having their childhoods robbed by them, the few.</p>
<p>When ship workers get tired of long hours in hot, miserable conditions and having to be far from home for them, the few.</p>
<p>When older workers get tired of bodies being worn out through years of labor for them, the few.</p>
<p>When younger workers get tired of getting the worst jobs and being dehumanized just because of their age for them, the few.</p>
<p>When retired workers get tired of being told that they are all used up and forced to live on less than when they labored for them, the few.</p>
<p>When service workers get tired of trying to serve the needs of people, while their own needs are not met by them, the few.</p>
<p>When house care workers get tired of working in the houses of the rich while hardly being able to afford housing for themselves for them, the few.</p>

<p>When the workers of the world get tired of being injured, sickened, and dying for the profit of them, the few.</p>
<p>When the workers of the world get tired of putting up with dehumanizing conduct where we are not only expected to labor to produce profit but also to endure abuse from them, the few.</p>
<p>When the workers of the world get tired of minimum gains for us and producing maximum profits for them, the few.</p>
<p>When the workers of the world decide that enough is enough and organize together in a one big union for the day-to-day struggles for a better life.</p>
<p>When the workers of the world decide that an injury to one is an injury to all and stand together in universal class solidarity.</p>
<p>When the organized power of the working class is greater than the organized power of the capitalist class, then workers will refuse to produce or provide services for them, the few, and take control of our labor, the means of production and services, and at that time we, the workers of the world, will have our new society. A society that ends all class conflict by eliminating classes all together. A society where production and services are for needs and the well-being of all. A society where the earth matters and we workers take responsibility for the effects our labor has on the environment that we all are dependent upon.</p>
<p>It is up to each of us, Fellow Workers, to build this new society, for it is built one worker at a time.</p>
<p>So Fellow Workers with whom do you stand? With the exploiters and oppressors, those who would doom our world, or with your Fellow Workers to help create a new society? The choice is up to you!</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_256 first"><a href="../../taxonomy/term/256/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for all our membership branches.
