</p>
<p>
During the first week of September 2008, Republican Party delegates
gathered in St. Paul, Minnesota for the Republican National
Convention
(RNC) - the media spectacle and corporate sleaze-fest that completes
their
nominating process. An army of armor-clad riot police, National Guard,
and
private security with their humvees, rubber bullets, and tear gas
protected them. FBI-assisted sheriff's raids at more than a
half-dozen
activist homes and organizing centers in Minneapolis-St. Paul sought
to
hinder opposition. But thousands of protestors still took to the
streets
to emphatically reject the Republicans' vicious policies of war,
discrimination, and attacks on the working-class and poor.
</p>
<p>
Among the more important mobilizing efforts against the RNC was the
Anti-Capitalist Bloc, an initiative of the Industrial Workers of the
World
(I.W.W.) union - Twin Cities General Membership Branch. The
Anti-Capitalist Bloc was conceived as an organizing front for the week
of
the RNC that would unite those anti-capitalist activists with an
orientation toward organizing. The Anti-Capitalist Bloc issued a
&quot;Call&quot;
and adopted a set of &quot;Solidarity Principles&quot; that made clear our
opposition to not only the Republican party but the whole system of
capitalism. Ten other groups signed on including three other I.W.W
branches. Approximately 1800 full-color posters with the
Anti-Capitalist
Bloc message were distributed over the course of the week.
</p>
<p>
But as Wobblies, we know that words are not enough, and so a series
of
events, actions, and contingents were organized by the
Anti-Capitalist
Bloc.
</p>
<p>
SATURDAY AUGUST 30th
</p>
<p>
Police Raids and preemptive arrests:
In the days leading up to the RNC, police, sheriff and federal
officers
conducted raids on several activist's homes and organizing centers.
The
main target were members and supporters of the the anarchist umbrella
group the &quot;RNC Welcoming Committee&quot;. The Welcoming Committee promoted
and
provided logistical support for a strategy of shutting down the RNC
through direct action blockades around the convention. Eight core
meembers
of the group were charged with felonies and accused of &quot;terrorism&quot; by
the
authorities. The activist Convergence Center rented by the Welcoming
Committee was raided by the police, who detained, photographed and
ID'd
the dozens present. The media largely went along with the police
story,
presenting tires in garages, grey water sceptic systems, and kerosene
as
dangerous weapons.
</p>
<p>
One raid in St. Paul hit the home of a large group of activists
including
one of the main Anti-Capitalist Bloc organizers. Police with assault
rifles raided and detained several activists present, searched the
house
and copied computer hard drives. The police eventually backed off,
releasing everyone without charge, after a large number of media,
legal
observers and activists arrived on the scene.
</p>
<p>
Benefit Concert:
A benefit concert organized by the Anti-Capitalist Bloc at the Bedlam
theater featuring the Rude Mechanical Orchestra, the Brass Messengers,
and
Mic Crenshaw brought folks together in the wake of the police house
raids
and raised needed funds for the defense of protesters and the
I.W.W.'s
active and public campaign at Starbucks.
</p>
<p>
SUNDAY AUGUST 31st
</p>
<p>
I.W.W. Starbucks Ra1ly:
The next day, the day before the RNC officially opened, approximately
75
supporters of the I.W.W.'s local Starbucks campaign rallied. One of
the
worker-organizes who had been fired for union activity had just won
re-instatement. Rank &amp; file activists from AFSCME, CWA, MAPE, SEIU,
and
Wobblies from across the country spoke, chanted and waved picket signs.
Labor Professor, author, and activist Peter Rachleff spoke. A heavy
police
presence monitored the rally.
</p>
<p>
At the close of the rally, an invitation was extended to those
assembled
to accompany the I.W.W. barista back to his first day of work at the
Mall
of America Starbucks. In an orderly fashion, so as not to provoke
police,
folks left the picket signs, bought tickets and boarded the
Light-Rail
Train from Minneapolis to the Mall of America. Aboard the train,
wobblies
and their supporters, spirts high, belted out &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;
and
other songs, and engaged the other riders who wondered about the
police
presence.
</p>
<p>
The Mall of America is located in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of
Minneapolis. At the first LRT stop in Bloomington, a contingent of
riot-police stopped the train and engaged the I.W.W. about our
intentions
at the Mall. When it was made clear to Bloomington PD that we were
merely
accompanying our Fellow Worker back to his job and that we did not
intend
to picket, protest, riot, or engage in any of the other disruptions
being
bandied about the media, they allowed us to continue.
</p>
<p>
At the Mall of America, it was a different story. As the train pulled
in
to the Mall station, dozens of fully-equipped riot police were
visible.
When the doors opened, an armored cop stood in front of each door
preventing anyone from leaving the train. Attempts to negotiate were
fruitless. No one, either with the I.W.W or passengers completely
separate
were allowed to leave. Police at first refused, then finally relented
to,
our demand that a woman and her child be allowed to exit as the woman
was
having a diabetes emergency.
</p>
<p>
Mall officials were calling the shots and the police were enforcing
them.
Eventually, the doors simply shut and the train pulled out of the
station
back toward Minneapolis to the chants of &quot;Bullshit!Bullshit!&quot; from
the
unionists and the other passengers alike.
</p>
<p>
Although we did not enter the Mall in force as planned, we were able
to
mobilize a good group of people in support of the I.W.W. Starbucks
campaign. The action highlighted the crucial role workplace
organizing
must play in anti-capitalist strategy - something that would not have
otherwise happened during the RNC protests.
</p>
<p>
The reaction of the police at the Mall reinforced our perspective:
The
police answer to property, not &quot;public safety&quot;; the bosses fear
workers
organizing as much as they do protests and blockades on the
streets.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Labor Day&quot; MONDAY SEPTEMBER 1st
</p>
<p>
Anti-Capitalist Bloc:
The first day of the Convention, Monday September 1st, Labor Day (and so
a
legal holiday in the U.S.) was always going to be the biggest day of
protest against the RNC. Both the major permitted march (March on the
RNC
and Stop the War) and the anarchist-inspired blockade strategy were
scheduled for Labor Day.
</p>
<p>
The Anti-Capitalist Bloc contingent in the permitted march was
conceived
as a visible organized contingent promoting the politics of
working-class
direct action anti-capitalism to the mass of anti-war, labor,
immigrant
rights, and other demonstrators. In this it was quite successful.
</p>
<p>
Over 300 people eventually joined in with the Bloc over the course of
the
march. The Bloc was led by Red &amp; Black &quot;DIRECT ACTION AGAINST
CAPITALISM&quot;
banners in front, on the right by the new Twin Cities I.W.W. banner
proclaiming &quot;SOLIDARITY&quot; in 5 languages (English, Spanish, Hmong,
Somali
and Finish - Ojibwe or Dakota will be added soon), and flanked on the
left
by Solidarity &amp; Defense's tri-lingual (English, Spanish, Arabic)
banner
against the raids on immigrants. A &quot;NO WAR BUT THE CLASS WAR&quot; banner
took
up the rear. This &quot;wall of banners&quot; system kept the Bloc cohesive and
visible, and gave participants a sense of security. A 5-person
&quot;tactical-team&quot; from the local committee was in place to make
emergency
tactical decisions should that have been neccesary.
</p>
<p>
The Bloc was loud and feisty. &quot;Capitalism? NO! Patriarchy? NO! Racism?
NO!
Revolution... Yeeeaah!&quot; &quot;No War, But Class War!&quot; &quot;No Justice, No
Peace!
Police off the Streets!&quot; &quot;Ah!An-ti!Anticapitalista!&quot; were some of the
chants that caught attention. At different intervals during the march
the
Anti-Capitalist Bloc would come to a halt to give short speeches and
allow
space to seperate in front of us, a countdown would ensue and then
the
Bloc would charge forward to the cries of &quot;Revolution!&quot; The Bloc
recieved
compliments from many observers of differing political stripes. One
union
staffer offered this gem: &quot;The IWW...you guys are like the black bloc
of
the labor movement.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The full-color poster/statement of the Anti-Capitalist Bloc was
distributed to 1000-1200 people at the March on the RNC. The
professional
look of the poster helped the Bloc stick out and was incentive to
onlookers and demonstrators to hang on to it. This helped on a day
when
they were being inundated with literature from the full spectrum of
the
Left. Many of the participants asked for extra-copies to bring home,
or
share with friends - a sign that the Anti-Capitalist Bloc will retain
some
memory within the movement. The poster was worth the high cost and
should
be seen as part of any succesfull future major mobilization.
</p>
<p>
The Bloc consistenly announced its intention to be a space where all
anti-capitalists could be present including people with kids, elders,
and
people with differing abilities. It was not significantly different
in
composition from previous efforts however - majority young white guys
with
a bit of a Black Bloc look. This was by no means exclusively the case
-
lots of women participated and a few people of color. Only a couple
young
children and a few older people marched with the Bloc. The Bloc made
a
serious effort to vocally oppose all oppression, but clearly our
movement
still has a lot to overcome before it will look like the whole
working-class, especially its most exploited and oppressed sections.
Interestingly, a clear majority of those that marched with us were
not
members of the I.W.W. or any of the other endorsing groups.
</p>
<p>
The Anti-Capitalist Bloc organizers stressed on multiple occasions
that
the purpose of this Bloc was not to engage in physical confrontations
with
the huge numbers of heavily armored police and Guard, but to help
expand
the base and popularity of anti-capitalist ideas and methods. At the
same
time it was stressed that we were not opposed to or in competition
with
those attempting to blockade the Convention. The logic of the
Anti-Capitalist Bloc was embraced by all the participants - even
among
those that had clearly come ready to rumble.
</p>
<p>
As the march finished up back at the state Capitol, the
Anti-Capitalist
Bloc came to an official end. A meeting was convened for those who
wished
to attempt to go back into downtown St. Paul and unite with the the
blockades. A large percentage of those on the Bloc plus some others
headed
back down. One estimate put the returning group at 200.
</p>
<p>
The returning march group soon met a sizable police force who
eventually
began shooting tear gas, rubber bullets, bean bags, and concussion
grenades at the crowd. Police eventually gave up trying to detain
the
whole group, picking off a few for arrest while most escaped, ending
one
of the largest stand-offs of the day.
</p>
<p>
SEIU:
Across the Mississippi River within view of the clouds of tear gas
and
confrontation, SEIU was holding a huge &quot;Take Back Labor Day&quot; concert
with
Billy Bragg, Mos Def, Steve Earle, Atmosphere, and others. Concerned
that
the concert crowd (nearly equal to the size of the whole anti-war
march)
may be tempted to join the fray, police blockaded the main bridge
into
downtown St. Paul. Hopefully some of the performers and concert goers
wondered why SEIU had decided to schedule their concert to conflict
with
the march, and even more shamefully, become the only union listed as
one
of the corporate sponsors of the Republican National Convention its
self.
</p>
<p>
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2nd
</p>
<p>
Poor People's March:
The next day, Tuesday September 2nd the Anti-Capitalist Bloc had
called
for another contingent in the Poor People's Economic Human Rights
Campaign
March for Our Lives. This march was much smaller than the previous day's
-
approximately 800 at the start, but included a more significant
percentage
of working poor and people of color. The Anti-Capitalist Bloc gathered
50
around the I.W.W. banner - including wobblies from several states,
Solidarity &amp; Defense from Michigan, a couple NEFACers (and Jeff Monson
the
anarchist UFC mixed martial arts fighter!).
</p>
<p>
Riot police again had a heavy presence and made several provocative
forays
into the rally to nab individuals ID'd in actions the day before, or
in
one case to grab a flag pole deemed larger than city regulations
allowed.
Several undercover/plainclothes police were quite obvious in the crowd
as
well.
</p>
<p>
The Poor People's march weaved it's way through downtown St. Paul.
The
Anti-Capitalist Bloc marched and sang (at one point the Manu Chao
lyrics
&quot;We are the workers/and we are marching/bella ciao, bella ciao, bella
ciao!&quot;) Another 300-500 posters were distributed by membeers of the
Bloc.
The march continued up to the state Capitol lawn, where the &quot;Ripple
Effect&quot; concert (featuring Dead Prez, Anti-Flag, Michael Franti, and
others) was winding down. The police were refusing to allow Rage
Against
The Machine to perform as the concert permit had expired. Members of
Rage
Against The Machine encouraged the hundreds of young people there to
join
the march. They mostly did, and the march easily tripled in size.
</p>
<p>
The march permit held by the Poor People's Economic Human Rights
Campaign
did not prevent police from again opening up with their full barrage
when
demonstrators ended up back outside the Xcel Energy Center where the
RNC
speeches were happening.
</p>
<p>
Truckers Fuel Protest:
The Anti-Capitalist Bloc did not end up participating in the
independent
truckers fuel protest that we had endorsed and promoted (other than
one
SDS/IWW member from North Dakota who was a key organizer of the
truckers
action). There had been both logistical and political problems. None
of
the IWW OTR truckers were able to make it - originally we had thought
a
few were coming - and the main Truck Driver organizers had been
insistent
that all vehicles in their convoy prominently fly the American flag.
In
the abscence of actual revolutionary unionist truckers present for
the
action, we did not feel we had the capacity to challenge the American
flag
&quot;rule&quot; for the convoy.
</p>
<p>
The convoy ended up being much smaller than hoped for and, like the
other
actions of the week, heavily policed.
</p>
<p>
WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 3rd
</p>
<p>
Anti-Capitalist Bloc meeting:
The next day two dozen participants in the Anti-Capitalist Bloc
gathered
at a meeting hosted by the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
chapter
at Macalester College. Besides SDS and the I.W.W., members of Solidarity
&amp;
Defense, NEFAC, Class Action and WSA were also present. Discussion
ranged
from &quot;big picture&quot; analysis of the current situation to an evaluation
of
the RNC action that week to more general info-sharing on the
respective
groups' activities and plans. While obviously incomplete, the meeting
was
an important opportunity for folks who'd been running around together
for
several days to take a moment to introduce each other and exchange
ideas
and experiences.
</p>
<p>
Rage Against the Machine:
While their efforts to take the stage at one of the free outdoor
concerts
of the week were consistently snubbed by the police, Rage Against the
Machine did play a scheduled show Wednesday night at the Target Center
in
Minneapolis (at $60.00 a ticket!). When the crowd of 10,000 emptied
the
arena at the end of the show, police in riot gear were there to meet
them.
Many of the Rage fans chanted defiant lyrics at the police and
hundreds
occupied the street around the Target Center, many of them sitting down
to
get arrested civil-disobedience style.
</p>
<p>
Whatever one thinks of Rage Against The Machine's sound or their place
in
the music industry, there is no doubt that they are treated as
dangerous
by the police. Their political message and attitude has struck a
nerve
with a sizable fan-base who seem willing to follow Rage's lead out
into
the streets. Tom Morello, the ground-breaking guitarist for Rage,
explicitly promotes the I.W.W. with his solo side project, the
&quot;Nightwatchman&quot;.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 4th
</p>
<p>
No Peace for the Warmakers:
On the final day of the RNC, while John McCain prepared to give his
acceptence speech, the final official action opposing the convention
also
took place. Organized by the local Anti-War Committee (one of the
main
groups behind the Monday anti-war march also) the demonstration was
boldly
titled &quot;No Peace for the Warmakers&quot;. Some 800 protestors left the
State
Capitol grounds in an unpermitted march toward the Xcel. Individuals
from
the Anti-Capitalist Bloc were present but were not organized into any
contingent this time. Riot police blocked every path toward the
Convention
and succeeded in sealing in the march several times long stretches of
time. Despite the march's theme, the march organizers were not
preopared
for direct action confrontations with the police, but did encourage a
massive sit-in to block one bridge (already blocked by police). The
stand-off ended when police moved to make mass arrests, and one final
time
attacked with pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
SOME CONCLUSIONS
The Anti-Capitalist Bloc @ the RNC was a succesful intervention by a
small
revolutionary workers organization and our allies in the week of
protest
and activity in our Cities. The hard work achieved results. The
Anti-Capitalist Bloc was able to articulate a popular revolutionary
militancy through a number of different types of events that involved
hundreds and communicated to thousands more.
</p>
<p>
At a time when the State was seeking to take advantage of some of the
weaknesses of the RNC Welcoming Committee's strategy and base, the
Anti-Capitalist Bloc conveyed in a non-sectarian way another approach
for
radicals.
</p>
<p>
While the number of people from endorsing groups that came from out
of
town was small, those that came contributed significantly to the
collective success. In this way it was an important continuation of
the
new spirit of collaboration among the groups and militants of the &quot;Red
&amp;
Black&quot; revolutionary anti-authoritarian movement.
</p>

We welcome comments, clarifications, questions, and criticisms.
