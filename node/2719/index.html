<p class="submitted">Submitted on Fri, 07/21/2006 - 2:05am</p>
<p><strong>By Melissa Meinzer - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/news/story.cfm?type=News%20Briefs#6445"><em>Pittsburgh City Paper</em>, July 20, 2006</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img border="1" align="right" src="../../graphics/IU460/EEFC/2_0005_co-opnews.jpg" />For many workers at the <strong>East End Food Co-op</strong>, the road to union recognition gets longer with every step they trudge. Although union supporters say a majority of workers have voted in favor of a union, the co-op is declining to recognize the election, in part because of a rival union effort begun by a former manager. And there is another source of controversy: the co-op&rsquo;s hiring of <strong>Braun Consulting</strong> &mdash; an organization seen by many employees as anti-union.</p><p>Workers at the <strong>Point Breeze</strong> natural foods outlet, who have been trying unsuccessfully to unionize for years, thought that their most recent push would be enough to have management recognize the <strong>Industrial Workers of the World</strong> as their union. They say that more than half of the 55-person staff signed union authorization cards between May 19<sup> </sup>and June 7. While members of the <strong>Workers Committee</strong>, the employee group heading up the IWW push, won&rsquo;t reveal just how many signed cards they have, committee member <strong>Evan Wolfson</strong> calls it &ldquo;a clear majority.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Workers Committee began pushing for management recognition of the century-old IWW in May to address concerns of high employee turnover, working conditions and raises they felt were slow in coming. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a peer-run task force that everyone can participate in,&rdquo; says stockroom Manager <strong>Jim M. Steiner</strong>, who supports the IWW.</p> <p>The co-op&rsquo;s board had resisted a similar union effort in 2003. Today, the board is more hands-off, leaving Co-op General Manager <strong>Rob Baran</strong> in charge of day-to-day operations &mdash; and dealing with the union drive. </p> <p>&ldquo;We stepped out,&rdquo; says board president <strong>Mike &ldquo;Q&rdquo; Roth</strong>. &ldquo;To step back in would cause confusion as to whose role is what.&rdquo; </p> <p>On July 10, the signed IWW union cards were verified by a third party &mdash; <strong>Garfield</strong>-based social justice organization <strong>The Thomas Merton Center</strong>. Co-op management could have recognized the IWW based on the cards alone &mdash; had not a rival union drive suddenly appeared two weeks earlier, started by a former management employee (see &ldquo;Co-op or Co-optation,&rdquo; July 6). </p> <p>On June 28, co-op supplement buyer <strong>Dan Denlinger</strong> began circulating a call to form a <em>different</em> union at the co-op &mdash; the <strong>United Co-operative Workers</strong>, which Denlinger created himself. This forced management to consider the brand-new union as a potentially equally valid representative of the co-op staff, or risk breaking federal law.</p> <p>Denlinger&rsquo;s fledgling UCW has the same legal protection as the venerable IWW, according to <strong>Mike Joyce</strong>, assistant to the regional director of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s branch of the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong>. The recognition of one union via signed cards alone isn&rsquo;t valid once another union enters the picture, he says.</p> <p>&ldquo;I feel like this other union is being used as a crutch,&rdquo; says Wolfson, adding that, in light of high turnover among co-op workers, any delay could be magnified by the need to have a new crop of employees decide whether or not to sign union cards.</p> <p>&ldquo;If the card check would have gone through it would have been done and over,&rdquo; says Steiner.</p> <p>Denlinger had been on the co-op&rsquo;s management team for about five weeks before demoting himself (with no reduction in pay) to his previous level. He resigned after speaking out about the union at a June 27 co-op meeting &mdash; something management is forbidden to do.</p> <p>&ldquo;I went home that night and it was like a little miniature <strong>Big Bang</strong> within myself: whoom!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I had a vision of this [new union], designed for us.&rdquo; At first he announced that his union&rsquo;s dues would be a penny a month, in contrast to the IWW&rsquo;s sliding scale of between $6 and $18 a month. He later backtracked to say that there would be other fees involved.</p> <p>IWW organizers suspect that the UCW was ginned up to sow divisiveness and to create obstacles to recognizing the IWW.</p> <p>Denlinger acknowledges that his timing might seem a bit suspect &ldquo;It definitely walks like a duck.&rdquo; But, he says, &ldquo;That is the only way it resembles what&rsquo;s been alleged&rdquo; by IWW organizers. </p> <p>Today, Denlinger reports, up to eight other employees are on board with his union. Presenting employees with only one option, he says, is far from democratic.</p> <p>Baran, the co-op&rsquo;s general manager, says he has been relying on a stable of advisors to help him through the union drive: other general managers at co-ops across the country, labor law lawyers and professors, and <strong>Bob Braun</strong>, of <strong>Braun Consulting</strong>, hired on June 28. Before that, he&rsquo;d been informally consulting with Braun.</p> <p>&ldquo;Braun is definitely anti-union,&rdquo; says Workers Committee member <strong>Stacy Clampitt</strong> (and sometime <strong><em>City Paper</em></strong> photographer). Fellow committee member Wolfson cites as evidence the latest online Braun newsletter, which includes information for employers on how to resist unionization: &ldquo;A positive environment with open communication and fairness can be crucial in preventing or defeating an organizing campaign,&rdquo; says the newsletter. It warns companies to watch &ldquo;the distinction the NLRB makes between &lsquo;work time&rsquo; and &lsquo;work hours.&rsquo; The NLRB says it&rsquo;s OK to prohibit employees from engaging in union activity under one but illegal under the other.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;The co-op hasn&rsquo;t asked me to defeat the union or interfere with the union,&rdquo; Bob Braun says by phone from his <strong>Seattle</strong> office. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;anti-union&rsquo; means. That&rsquo;s an emotional term that people evoke. It&rsquo;s like saying you&rsquo;re anti-air.&rdquo;</p> <p>Braun says that all three of Braun Consulting&rsquo;s employees are <strong>Teamsters</strong> in <strong>Washington</strong> state. He declined to specify to which local they belonged, preventing confirmation among the many Seattle locals.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re just doing what other people tell us,&rdquo; says the co-op&rsquo;s Baran, defending his use of Braun. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re making our own decisions. We want them to be informed decisions.&rdquo;</p> <p>Baran and Braun both say they are committed to ushering in a legal, fair and democratic unionizing process, and that a secret-ballot election is the best way to do so. </p> <p>Co-op workers in favor of the IWW see such an election, pitting their union against Denlinger&rsquo;s newly minted effort, as just another way to delay the recognition of a union at the Co-op. </p> <p>&ldquo;There are loopholes and ways people can fight union campaigns,&rdquo; says Baran. &ldquo;We are <em>not</em> going to do that. It&rsquo;s staff&rsquo;s decision. The fairest thing for us to do is to have an election.&rdquo;</p> <p>Who will oversee such an election, and when, remains to be determined.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_244 first"><a href="../../category/branches/all-branches/pittsburgh-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our Pittsburgh General Membership Branch.
