<p>With
what ever parts I need that morning, I drag myself up the gangway of the
ship and go over to the gangbox to get my tools. I have found that if I
don't get a fast start in the beginning of the shift, the day will drag
by slowly. So in the first hour of the day is one of my most productive.
</p>
<p>Few working people know the true history of their class. This is not their
fault. The history of the working class is not taught in the schools and
the business unions don't touch on it much. What we are taught is the history
of the employers and the politicians, and how great the U.S. has always
been. The fact that everything that working people have gained has come
about through struggle, is a fact that has been censored out of the history
books used in schools. The Eight Hour Day Movement is one such struggle
that few workers today know anything about.
</p>
<p>One of the first universal demands of the U.S. labor movement was the eight
hour day. In the early 1860s this demand spread across the country as eight
hour day leagues were founded. Such labor organizations as the International
Labor Union of America (the forerunner of the AFL) made the eight hour
day their priority. The reasons given for this movement was the right of
leisure time for working people and that an eight hour day would reduce
unemployment.
</p>
<p>By 1867, several states and cities had granted public employees the eight
hour day. In 1868 Congress granted it to federal workers.
</p>
<p>Across the country the eight hour day movement continued to grow. Massive
marches and rallies were held and a number of strikes were called. Songs
and poems were written that were known by working people across the land.
One of the more popular ones was written by J.G. Blanchard.

<p>After
it was found that the passing of labor laws did little, because it was
hard to get them enforced, many eight hour day activists decided that only
economic action would win the demand. A general strike was called for the
eight hour day, to begin on May 1, 1886. Hundreds of thousands of workers
went on strike that day across the U.S. The next day even more workers
joined in. Unfortunately the general strike was lost because of a repressive
backlash after what history has come to call the Haymarket Affair in Chicago.</p>
<p>
Chicago had long been one of the most repressive cities in the U.S. when
it came to labor struggles. It was very common, back in those days, for
the Chicago police to beat peaceful unarmed strikers and marchers, sometimes
even shooting down these people in cold blood. The employer's newspapers
encouraged these acts by the police against working people. it is inevitable
when any group of people are treated in this manner, that someone will
strike back in self-defense.
</p>
<p>On May 1, 1886 over forty thousand workers in Chicago had joined the general
strike. The next two days thousands more were added to the ranks of striking
workers. Workers throughout Chicago were holding marches and rallies in
support of their demand. One such rally was being held by striking lumber
workers on May 3rd. Near where their rally was being held was the McCormick
Reaper Works that had locked-out the union workers, and brought in scabs
to take their jobs.
</p>
<p>When the factory whistle signaled the change of shift, many of the lumber
workers went over to the picketline in solidarity. The police and the hated
Pinkertons attacked these workers and after beating many of them, the police
opened fire with their guns, killing three workers, and wounding many others.
</p>
<p>Members of the International Working People's Association were among the
speakers at the lumber worker's rally. After they witnessed this bloody
affair, they organized a protest meeting that night in a place called the
Haymarket Square.
</p>
<p>At that meeting many labor activists denounced the murders of working people
by the Chicago police. The meeting was almost over when the police showed
up to breakup the peaceful gathering. At the police line began to move
in on the peaceful working people someone threw a bomb into the ranks of
the attacking police. After the bomb went off the police panicked and began
to shoot blindly. Contrary to how many history books have recorded this
event, the medical reports show that only one of the police died directly
from the bomb. The deadly wounds to the other policemen included bullet
wounds. And many of those wounds came about because of the panic gun fire
of the police.
</p>
<p>The media and the employers created a state of hysteria that allowed for
much of the labor movement to be suppressed. Eight labor activist of the
International Working People's Association and the Central Labor Union,
who were also anarchists, were put on trial for murder and conspiracy.
There was no evidence connecting these men to the bomb or bomb thrower.
However these eight labor activists were found guilty. The unfairness of
the trial was even denounced by a number of conservative judges. Four of
these men were hanged, August Spies, George Engel, Adolph Fischer and Albert
Parsons. One man, Louis Lingg, cheated the executioner by taking his own
life the night before the hangings. Samuel Fielden, Michael Schwab and
Oscar Neebe were sent to prison.
</p>
<p>After the country regained a bit of its sanity, working people once again
started to demand the eight hour day. The lumberjacks of the Industrial
Workers of the World (IWW), found the most direct means of winning the
eight hour day. In the northwest lumber camps, the IWW workers just walked
off the job every day after working eight hours.
</p>
<p>The eight hour day became the norm throughout industry after long struggles
by thousands of working people. Today the eight hour day is being lost
because the labor movement has become passive in defending this gain.</p></div> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
