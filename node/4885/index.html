<p><img align="right" alt="" src="../../graphics/IU330/Ray_Jessop_3204695.jpg" />On December 8th, FW Vale Ray Jessop died in an industrial accident, while at work.&nbsp; Below is one obituary for the Fellow Worker, and a link to an article about the accident.<br />
<br />
On the 6th December Fellow Worker Ray Jessop of Hull was killed in a workplace accident. Enquiries are continuing into the circumstances of Ray's death, but evidence is emerging that the cost-cutting policies of his employer, Kier, played a large part. It will be some time before a formal inquest takes place, but I have heard that UCATT, of which Ray was a member, is seriously considering making a case for a corporate manslaughter prosecution.<br />
<br />
Although Ray was not well known in the OBU he was a loyal member and supporter of our union which he joined in 2002. He was not a passive member of UCATT and spoke out against managerial abuses. Workmates had tried to persuade him to take the shop steward's position, but he declined as he did not feel that he was the right person for that task.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ray was also active in other areas of struggle, and was particularly active in the animal rights movement, among whose ranks he had many friends. He was a conscientious member of the Hull branch of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, and active in the Campaign Against the Arms Trade and the Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases.<br />
<br />
Ray was also a very sociable person who enjoyed a drink and a (vegan) meal with like minded friends, and he was particularly fond of live music, his preferences being reggae and ska. He will be sorely missed by those who knew him, as the outpouring of tributes and affectionate memories testifies.<br />
Ray was 53 years old. <br />
<br />
If the measure of someone is how people are remembered then Ray was truly remarkable he has drawn tributes from pagans, trade unionists, animal rights activists and in the local paper where people can comment on articles people who said they didn't agree with him on anything still respected him and regarded him as honest. Many commented &quot;this country needs more people like Ray&quot;. As well as a large gathering at Ray's funeral, he has also been honoured by his favourite pub with a tree and a photo and a pagan ceremony is also arranged for next summer.</p>
