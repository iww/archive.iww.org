<p><img src="../../graphics/IU460/NYCmisc/83196.jpg" align="right" border="1" />
Wouldn’t it be a real travesty to spend $50 on a wonderful
lobster dinner at New York City’s highest rated restaurant, only to
find out after your meal that the food was rotten?
</p>
<h2>Behind the scenes at New York City’s #1 rated restaurant</h2>
<p>
Of course, fine dining establishments must comply with health and
safety standards in their kitchens. Of course, establishments ranked as
NYC’s most popular wouldn’t dare serve rotten seafood. But there may
not be any rotten seafood at all—this is only on the surface. Something
happens well before the seafood even reaches the kitchen and it will
make you even sicker.
</p>
<p>
It’s actually the company which supplies seafood to some of the
city’s favorite restaurants that’s rotten; that systematically treats
its workers rotten—they’re called Wild Edibles.
</p>
<p>
Wild Edibles supplies seafood to a range of locations
throughout New York, including some of the highest-rated spots in
Zagat’s guide, including a chain of restaurants operated by -famous NYC
restauranteur Danny Meyers. With such high-profile customers, it
wouldn’t seem that company CEO Richard Martin needs to cut costs, but
in light of illegal labor practices he may need to start worrying about
losing business.
</p>
<h2>The last step in the NYC food chain</h2>
<p>
Beginning shifts at 2 in the morning and continuing with physically
demanding delivery and factory work into the early afternoon, workers
at the Queens-based seafood company usually work more than 8 hours per
day with few breaks and inadequate pay. While the conditions in
themselves are hardly tolerable, continued discrimination and
harassment have resulted in some people quitting and others getting
fired.
</p>
<p>
Former employee Augustin Meza says that in his five years at
the company, he witnessed and experienced consistent racial
discrimination and eventually quit out of frustration. Meza said that
Latino workers were denied rights and privileges that were granted to
their white co-workers. Meza saw evidence of this in comparing
timecards. He said that while Caucasian workers never worked more than
8 hours per day, Latino workers would work 10 or more hours without
receiving overtime pay. Additionally, Latinos were generally made to
work “half-time” on holidays because it would make the next day’s work
“easier for everyone else.”
</p>
<p>
Latinos also faced higher scrutiny. They were made to pay for
soft drinks when white workers received them for free, and management
constantly watched them like hawks.
</p>
<p>
“(Martin) was always telling us ‘you have to do something’ and
making us work. But when white people were outside smoking and laughing
with each other, he didn’t say anything,” Meza said.
</p>
<p>
After years of working under these conditions, Meza made three
attempts to speak directly with owner Richard Martin about his
concerns, but was simply ignored.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Meza is not the only person who has had to deal with
wretched conditions at Wild Edibles. His co-workers dealt with similar
exploitative conditions, and after years of tolerating discriminatory
practices, they united together and stood up to the bosses.
</p>
<h2>Organizing and union-busting</h2>
<p>
In mid-July 2007, New York City Industrial Workers of the World
(IWW) organizers reached out to Wild Edibles truck drivers and
warehouse workers to build organizing efforts. Within a little more
than a month, workers were actively organizing with the union to demand
an end to exploitative conditions.
</p>
<p>
One worker who immediately took on a leadership role in
organizing, Raymundo Lara Molina, was fired after a month because of
his involvement. According to IWW organizer Billy Randal, workers at
the plant “felt someone had identified him as an active union
supporter.”
</p>
<p>
Following this, workers became increasingly concerned about
being targeted and picked out, but this did not hamper their efforts.
</p>
<p>
On August 20 at 2 AM, IWW supporters and members joined Wild
Edibles workers and marched on the plant--demanding that Martin pay
overtime, reinstate Molina, and cease further retaliation against Wild
Edibles employees for union involvement.
</p>
<p>
During the action, Martin retaliated on the spot by firing
another organizer, Jason Borges. According to public testimony, Martin
called Borges into his office, asked him what he wanted, and when
Borges replied that he wanted to be paid overtime and receive benefits,
Martin refused and promptly fired him, yelling at Borges to “get the
f--- out” as Borges left the premises.
</p>
<p>
On August 24, Raul Molina was also fired in retaliation. In
the weeks following, Julio Cesar Moreno Gonzalez and Marco Antonio
Corona were forced to leave due to the high pressure that they faced.
</p>
<h2>Taming Wild Edibles</h2>
<p>
In response to illegal discrimination, sixteen current and former
Wild Edibles employees filed a Federal class action lawsuit against the
company on September 17. According to the complaint, Wild Edibles
violated New York Labor Law and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by
not compensating workers 1 ½ times the base wage for working more than
40 hours per week, and by discriminating and retaliating for protected
activity.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, a temporary injunction was filed in order to
protect workers from further intimidation and retaliation. Despite this
order, two more workers, Jose Fernandez and Limo Martinez, were fired
in late September.
</p>
<p>
As litigation continues, the six fired workers and their
supporters continue to draw attention to the company’s illegal
practices through the courts and beyond.
</p>
<p>
Just after the suit was filed in court, current and fired Wild
Edibles workers, members of the IWW and supporters from the
newly-formed workers’ rights organization Brandworkers International,
held a press conference in front of one of Wild Edibles’ largest
customer restaurants, an upscale French restaurant in the West Village
called Pastis. In addition to announcing the lawsuit, workers alerted
customers that Pastis was serving seafood processed under shameful
conditions.
</p>
<p>
With the spotlight shined on Wild Edibles' unfair employment
practices, Pastis owner Keith McNally agreed on October 4 to stop doing
business with Wild Edibles. McNally’s other fine dining
restaurants—Balthazar, Schiller’s, Morandi, Pravda, and Lucky
Strike—have also discontinued business with the seafood company until
the dispute is resolved. All in all, this created a significant dent in
Wild Edibles’ business, causing them to lose approximately 10% of their
revenue, or $1 million per year, according to court papers.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, current Wild Edibles workers are re-building union
presence in the shop, with a “very strong sense of solidarity,” said
Billy Randal. Because of the increased pressure from the IWW and
Brandworkers International, demands are slowly being met as the
campaign strengthens.
</p>
<p>
As litigation continues, workers are fighting together across
the food supply chain in the hopes that current employees will live and
work in humane conditions, that former employees will receive the
compensation that is owed to them, and that justice, not rotten
seafood, will be served.
