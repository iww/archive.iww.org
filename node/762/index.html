<div id="content"><div id="article-762" class="article article-full article-type-book">
<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>Some jobs will give you
breaks beyond your lunch break. I have worked thirteen shipyards and the
longest I have worked in one day is 23 hours, and only one shipyard gave
us any extra breaks. Many employers are so arrogant when it comes to their
workers that they will not even do things that will improve production.
Taking breaks to get some coffee and a little rest will improve production
and cut down on mistakes.
</p>
<p>It is not just the worker who suffers from having to work long hours. I
believe that the children may suffer the most. In toady's world many of
our children are being neglected because both parents must work, or the
family has but one parent that must work. If one or both parents are forced
to work overtime, then the situation is even worse. Some day care is good,
although often the day care that poorer workers can afford is not so good.
But regardless of the quality of day care, children need the love and special
attention that good parents provide.
</p>
<p>It is not the fault of working class parents that they have to work. And
when they are forced to work overtime the neglect of their children becomes
an added stress upon their lives. You can explain to a child the reasons
why you are not there. And the child may understand those reasons, but
that will not prevent the feelings of being abandoned that may set into
the child.
</p>
<p>When I am forced to work long hours, my son would have many difficulties.
Often he would ask me, how much longer that this must go on? No matter
what I could say or do, I knew that there was no way to regain the lost
time. He was growing up and at times
</p>
<p>I could not be there
for him. Even though I knew that I had to work those hours to keep my job,
still I could not prevent myself from feeling guilty.
</p>
<p>Children who feel unwanted or that they are a burden will often strike
out. They may hurt others around them or they may hurt themselves. In the
beginning this may be just a means of getting attention, a statement that
they are here too, and don't they count for something? Later on this may
turn to anger, for there is nothing more hurtful for a child than feeling
abandoned. As they grow older they may try to numb their hurt feels in
alcohol or drugs. They may find that missing feeling of belonging in gangs.
</p>
<p>The government's solution to young ones striking out is to cause them even
more pain by placing them in institutions or prisons. These places only
reinforce the child's negative feelings. In time as the young person grows
up in those places they become so harden sometimes that they end up doing
something terrible and then society wonders why.
</p>
<p>The politicians and preachers are such hypocrites with all their talk of
family values and the need of children to have good parents there for them,
if these concerns were real then they would be passionate advocates for
the 8 hour day, good wages and decent working conditions. They are all
fast to blame the parents if a child gets into trouble, but not one word
is spent about the many things that keep parents from being there for their
kids. They would rather send money on institutions and prisons than for
good community child care and programs for the young. The reason for this
hypocrisy is that if they were to talk about the real causes of the problems,
they would be forced to denounce their benefactors. For every super rich
parasite, there are thousands of children going without the things they
need. In that the politicians and preachers are saying that the need of
the rich to get richer is more important than the needs of our children.
</p>
<p>So who is really to blame for the troubled youth? The greedy few, that's
who!</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR SIX</p>
<p>Often the stress of working
long hours and living only to work for some boss will create anger. And
anger always seeks an outlet. The longer it grows the greater the outburst
will be. The outburst of anger is more often than not, directed at others
than at the real cause of the anger. When workers lack the proper rest
that they need and anger sets in because of that, arguments over minor
things are common on the job.
</p>
<p>A stressful society is a violent society. The increase of such things like
road rage and domestic violence are signs of an increasingly stressful
society. Though stress is no excuse for violence, it is a factor. And to
decrease violence we must decrease the factors that contribute to violence.
While it is true that we all must learn not to take out our anger on whoever
is near by, holding that anger in is no solution either, for it will only
build up making the outburst far worse.
</p>
<p>When your life is not much more that to eat, sleep and work, the outlet
for your anger will be either at work, on the road to or from work, or
at home. Every working person needs time off to relieve built up stress.
Thus, the 8 hour day is a vital factor in building a non-violent society.</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR SEVEN</p>
<p>Isn't it amazing how such
a small thing like taking a break for lunch can become something so enthusiastically
looked forward to? When you are working long hours it becomes even more
so. It is in part because there is so little else to look forward to. It
is not really the act of eating that you long for, but rather just not
having to work that is so desirable. I always seem to notice when it is
a hour before lunch. Then begins the daily ritual of checking the time.
45 minutes 'till lunch, 30 minutes 'till lunch, 15 minutes 'till lunch,
5 minutes 'till lunch, one minute 'till lunch. Then when lunch comes you
waste the good feeling dreading its conclusion.
</p>
<p>When you are working long hours, this over enthusiastic feeling for such
small things as lunchbreak, represents the dullness of your life. When
you are this weary there is but one dominating thought in your existence,
and that is the little time that you have for the pursuit of not working.
Nearly everything else we either have no time for, or we are just too damn
tired to do it. Life itself becomes dull, meaningless and our spirit fades.
We spend so many hours of the day hoping for time to pass by quickly, bring
us in fact closer to our death. Time that we can never get back.
</p>
<p>Overtime is a theft of our lives. And the robber is but a greedy parasite
that cares nothing for our existence but for the wealth we produce for
them. Damn I wish it were quitting time and not just lunch time!</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR EIGHT</p>
<p>Going back to work after
lunch is always a great let down. Its like only taking one bite of your
favorite food, it sure does taste good, but you are left with a longing
for more. Like the beginning of the shift, for me, it is important to get
a fast start after lunch. It is hard to explain how time slows down when
you are tired. But when that fatigue sets in, and the monotony of continuous
work drags upon the spirit, everything seems to be happening in super slow
motion. So getting active as much as possible puts off the slow down feeling.
</p>
<p>Stress and fatigue produces apathy and carelessness. Things that we normally
are concerned about become a burden. One of the things that suffers when
we are in this state of being is the environment. You tend to do what ever
is the easiest. And that may mean dumping something, rather than disposing
of it properly. You may see a problem developing, but your reaction time
is too slow because you are too tired to prevent it. Or you are just too
tired to gave a damn.
</p>
<p>To many of us fail to understand that the environment is not something
that we live apart from. Rather it is something that we live in and are
a part of . And within this ecological system all things are connected.
Thus, what we do that affects one part of the ecological system, has effects
throughout the ecological system, far greater than many of us image. Often
things work in a cycle, or as some may put it, the cause and effect cycle.
For every action there is a reaction. When we are abused, and being forced
to work long hours, then we pass along that abuse. And when we abuse the
environment, that abuse will return to us in countless ways.
</p>
<p>The suit and tie middle class environmentalists, for the most part, do
not understand that the human environment has a direct relationship to
the overall environment. You cannot change how we treat the over all environment
without also changing how humans treat each other. Thus, human abuse is
a part of the environmental cycle of abuse. And that makes the eight hour
day an environmental issue.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
