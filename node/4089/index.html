<p>
The syndicalist SAC union in Sweden has been campaigning for fair
wages for illegal immigrants in the last few months, resulting in
thousands of pounds in unpaid wages being paid to migrant workers.
</p>
<p>
The increasing organisation of illegal immigrants within the
syndicalist union SAC have lead to more and more blockades to force the
payment of unpaid wages, mainly from employment agencies in the
restaurant, cleaning, hotel and building industry. Millions Kronor in
unpaid wages have been have been won by the SAC. That these companies
and their customers don't want to attract attention to their
exploitation of illegal immigrants, in most cases the mere threat of a
union blockade has been enough to get the wages paid.
</p>
<p>
Parallel to this defensive work, the SAC have started
organising a list of workplaces where the employer is only allowed to
employ members from the syndicalist register, working as a closed shop
for illegal immigrant workers, setting wages, six-hour-workdays and
democratically electing bosses on the workplaces. At the moment these
workplaces are paying untaxed wages for illegal immigrants, exchange
students and asylum seekers but the aim is to organise this amongst all
forms of precarious labour.
</p>
<p>
The register has ben dominated by illegal latin american
workers, but after theese 2 victorys the SAC hopes 4 a breakthrough
with organise the growing amount off illegal indian/pakistan workers in
sweden.
</p>
<p>
But at the Pakistani restaurant Lilla Karachi in Stockholm, the
employers tried to set their foot down. The restaurant rejected demands
on 80,000 Kronor (£6,150) untaxed wage for a union member and a longer
blockade was begun. Since the restaurant is in the same neighbourhood
as the Swedish right wing government parties Moderaterna and
Centerpartiet, it was soon filled daily with &quot;solidarity eaters&quot;
specifically eating their to break the blockade. Leading right wing
politicians, led by the daily paper Svenska Dagbladets editorial Maria
Abrahansson, were ranting on blogs and in media, calling the blockade
an 'mafia tactic' and comparing the SAC with Hell's Angels and Bandits.
They have also demanded that police should arrest all the union
activists involved and that union rights allowing blockades to be
launched be repealed.
</p>
<p>
After 2 months off daily blockades and the SAC paper Arbetarens
explaining that Lilla Karachi owners have threatened the SAC member's
family in Pakistan, don't pay the minimum wage in their deal with the
social democratic union and have used a fake book-keeper as a witness
off innocence in media, the opinion shifted and a lot of the right wing
politicians officially regretted their solidarity eating. After a
couple of weeks with hardly any evening customers, the Lilla Karachi
restaurant agreed to pay out the wage.
</p>
<p>
The SAC has also started a conflict against McDonalds who have
used an employment agency with illegal immigrants for an hourly
pay-rate of 33 Kronor (£2.50) when the union deal is 90 Kronor (£6.90).
The same right wing politicians called it mafia behaviour but
McDonald's paid the salaries after only a week off conflict.
</p>
<p>
So far, the syndicalist register has been dominated by illegal
Latin American workers, however, its hoped that these two victories
will be a breakthrough for the SAC in organising illegal south Asian
workers in Sweden.
