Ten people from Pittsburgh traveled to Baltimore on April 18, 2009
for a B’More Fair and a Human Rights March hosted by the United Workers
Association (UWA). The United Workers Association is the Human Rights
Organization that organized the Camden Yards cleaners, part time
workers, “temporary” workers hired through a contractor, by putting
pressure on Maryland’s Stadium Authority and Peter Angelos, owner of
the Baltimore Oriels Baseball Club. They coined the terms “SweatFree
Baseball” in reference to the sweatshop working conditions at Camden
Yards at the same time as the Pittsburgh Anti Sweatshop Community
Alliance (PASCA) coined the term in reference to its demand that the
Pittsburgh Pirates accept the testimony of sweatshop workers sewing
Pirates apparel. The UWA came to Pittsburgh for the All Star Game in
2006 and joined with PASCA to make the demand that our local baseball
teams respect the Human Rights of all workers.
</p>
<p>
The UWA interviewed 150 workers at three restaurants in Baltimore’s
Inner Harbor development. The interviews demonstrated systemic
violations of workers’ rights such as poverty wages and sexual
harassment. The UWA has begun to process these worker rights violations
by using the International Declaration of Human Rights like a union
contract. By declaring the Inner Harbor a Human Rights Zone, the
restaurant bosses, the developer, the public officials who provided
subsidies to the Inner Harbor developers and the Baltimore community is
made aware that the workers know and intend to exercise their Human
Rights to remedy violations of their rights.
</p>
<p>
The enforcement of workers’ Human Rights is different from
traditional union organizing in that it emphasizes workers knowing
their rights and exercising them rather than a union contract. The
emphasis is not on achieving a union contract but on the community of
workers that educate one another and provide support to one another on
a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
There is an obvious similarity between the Human Rights Zone and the
Community Benefits Agreements that Pittsburghers have become familiar
with in the context the new Penguin’s Hockey Arena. In both cases
community groups try to leverage the huge tax subsidies to ensure
respect for workers on the job. However, a Human Rights Zone is built
on the job AFTER permitting process and tax subsidy is in place – the
implementation strategy is focused on workers demanding their rights
rather than the mobilization of political support on the boss’s
development time frame.
</p>
<p>
The symbol chosen to advertise and educate about the Human Rights
Zone was Harriet Tubman, emphasizing her leadership in the struggle
against slavery. Members of the UWA has previously traveled along the
Underground Railroad and educated themselves about the struggle against
slavery identified themselves as being part of a continuous struggle
for Human Rights that has gone on throughout our history. In that
spirit, members of the Pittsburgh delegation stopped at Harpers Ferry
before arriving in Baltimore to learn about John Brown and the armed
resistance he lead more than 20 years before the outbreak of the Civil
War.
</p>
<p>
All were strengthened and affirmed that the International
Declaration of Human Rights is indeed a living document. The
declaration of Human Rights Zones in Baltimore is similar to the best
organizing that has occurred in the world’s Export Processing Zones
where sweatshop workers have to organize at multiple work sites
simultaneously and cannot rely on local legal systems to protect them.
Members of the Pittsburgh Anti Sweatshop Community Alliance have long
asserted that the workers sewing Pirates apparel will be fired from
their jobs, or worse, with impunity when they try to exercise their
rights and that the “Civil Rights Bridge” we are building to the floor
of the global sweatshop is a necessary precondition for their success.
No Sweatshops Bucco!
</p>
<p>
Amongst the most exciting Pittsburgh/Baltimore connections made on
our trip was that with Baltimore’s organization of high school students
known as the “Red X Party” and the Algebra Project. The Algebra Project
uses the pedagogy of Bob Moses in a peer to peer algebra tutoring
program. The tutoring programs have been able to demonstrate it success
improving student test scores and describes education as a right
derived from the US Constitution. The Algebra Project pays its tutors
through grants and some funding from the Baltimore Public Schools. The
leadership that has developed through the Algebra Project has taken up
other kinds of organizing amongst the student body and advocacy for
public policies that effect young people. Members of the Algebra
Project will be hosted in Pittsburgh by B-PEP’s Regional Equity
Monitoring Project and the Community Empowerment Association in the
near future.
