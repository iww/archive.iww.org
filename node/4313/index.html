<p><img src="../../graphics/IU410/GhangiClemente72.jpg" align="right" />
Earlier this month, Gov. Ed Rendell endorsed an interstate effort to better
enforce anti-sweatshop policies. Pennsylvania is the first state to pledge its
support for a proposed anti-sweatshop consortium, made up of states, counties
and municipalities from across the country.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Rendell has taken the leadership of states nationally,&quot; says Kenneth Miller,
who has long been active in local anti-sweatshop campaigns. &quot;He requires the
disclosure of factory locations. He requires wage disclosure. And he's taking
the leadership in consolidating that information with different
jurisdictions.&quot;
</p>
<p>
During the July 11-12 weekend, which featured the National SweatFree Summit
in Philadelphia, Rendell's office announced that he signed a &quot;declaration of
intent,&quot; stating that Pennsylvania planned to participate in a nationwide
&quot;sweatfree consortium.&quot; The consortium is still in its planning stages, but
organizers are hoping that Rendell's decision will convince other government
agencies to get involved.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Taxpayer funds should not be used to support sweatshops that profit from the
sale of goods while workers are denied basic human rights,&quot; Rendell said in a
release. &quot;State and local government represent a major consumer block, by
committing to stop the purchase of goods made in sweatshops we can drive
companies to improve working conditions.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The governor's position is that it's the morally imperative thing to do,&quot;
says Rendell press secretary Chuck Ardo.
</p>
<p>
Pennsylvania joins Portland, Ore., Berkeley, Calif., and Lucas County, Ohio,
as the fourth government purchaser to announce its support for a consortium.
Additionally, Bjorn Claeson, the executive director of the national organization
SweatFree Communities, says, &quot;There are a number of public entities that have
officially declared that they want to cooperate to pool resources,&quot; even if they
haven't committed to doing so through the consortium.
</p>
<p>
Pennsylvania is one of seven states that already have anti-sweatshop laws,
Claeson says. But he adds, &quot;[I]t's unfeasible for a single state&quot; to verify
labor standards on the other side of the globe. &quot;Nor does a single state have
significant influence&quot; over vendors if it discovers abuses.
</p>
But a consortium of government agencies would have better resources to
investigate overseas working conditions. Such a consortium would also have more
purchasing power, and thus more leverage over distributors.
<p>
Claeson says he &quot;hope[s] to build upon the momentum that we have now with
Gov. Rendell's commitment.&quot; The timing of Rendell's announcement seems
auspicious. The SweatFree Summit included films and testimony from former
garment workers. Dennis Brutus -- a professor emeritus at the University of
Pittsburgh and (with Miller) a co-founder of the Pittsburgh Anti-Sweatshop
Community Alliance in 2002 -- also spoke.
</p>
<p>
The Summit coincided with the centennial celebration for the National
Governors Association, which also took place in Philadelphia that weekend.
Rendell became chairman of the NGA on July 14.
</p>
<p>
Claeson hopes that Rendell will &quot;create space for this issue&quot; at the winter
meeting of the NGA in February, and that his support will encourage other
governors to endorse the consortium.
</p>
<p>
Claeson says the consortium will officially launch when its members represent
a combined purchasing pool of $100 million. With the addition of Pennsylvania,
he estimates that the consortium has roughly $11 million in pledged buying power
now.
</p>
<p>
A steering committee of advocates, educators and public officials has already
assembled (www.sweatfree.org/sweatfreeconsortium). It's working to get more
cities and states to sign on, while also developing bylaws and an organizational
structure for the consortium once it launches.
</p>
<p>
Will Rendell use his new NGA position to push the anti-sweatshop agenda?
While Rendell &quot;believes that other states should join,&quot; Ardo says, &quot;I don't
think he has any plans to reach out [to other governors] at the moment.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Although, I think that given his prominence, it certainly gets the attention
of other states.&quot;
