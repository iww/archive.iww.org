</p>By Dave Zirin<br />
<br />
It's amazing how an eight-minute phone call can cloud a
charmed life. <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial" class="yshortcuts">Dallas
Mavericks owner</span> Mark Cuban, like Martha Stewart before him, is officially
in hot water with the SEC. They allege that Cuban sold 600,000 shares in the
search engine <a href="http://mamma.com/" target="_blank">Mamma.com</a> Inc. in June 2004, saving him $750,000.
Cuban has responded publicly and angrily on his blog that the entire imbroglio
is &quot;a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion.&quot; The entire story has
generated as much buzz as a battalion of mosquitoes. That's due to the Dancing
With the Stars alumnus at the center of it all. To some, he is a hero--the only
true fan/owner in existence. To others, such as sportswriter Tony Kornheiser, he's just a
&quot;preening schmo.&quot; But almost everyone in the basketball universe gives the
flamboyant 50-year-old billionaire a measure of respect.<br />
<br />
In the decade
before Cuban took over the Mavericks, the team went 199-507, one of the most
putrid records in all professional sports. They were owned, amid failure, by
Ross Perot Jr. Texas money and a legacy of losing defined the franchise. Then
came Cuban, a son of working-class parents who decided to wear Mavs jerseys to
games, sit in the stands, scream at refs, rev up the fans, pamper his players
and even e-mail with hoi polloi. Despite a slow start this season, the Mavericks
have been perennial championship contenders.<br />
<br />
&quot;He took one of the worst
teams in the NBA and made it one of the best,&quot; Nets point guard Devin Harris said recently. &quot;He gutted everything, changed the whole culture.
He's very hands-on, obviously very good taking an organization and remaking it.&quot;
He also earned respect when he took the racist e-mails directed at Mavericks
all-star Josh Howard and posted
them on his own &quot;blog maverick&quot; site--with the actual e-mail addresses of the
senders.<br />
<br />
<p>
How did Cuban become the ultimate owner-fan? It's less a Horatio Alger story
than Cuban's becoming, as USA Today wrote, &quot;the luckiest man from the dot-com
era.&quot; Cuban made his billions by getting out of the dot-coms before they bombed.
He and partner Todd
Wagner sold their company, <a href="http://broadcast.com/" target="_blank">Broadcast.com</a>, to Yahoo!
for billions of dollars, a ridiculously large amount for a company earning no
more than $100 million in revenues. Cuban was smart enough to see how idiotic
this inflation was and cashed out before his company, like most of the industry,
saw its stock price plunge. Some would call this smart business, but most in the
media choose to see it as dumb luck. Others see Cuban as just plain dumb. Rick
Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune wrote that Cuban proves &quot;it's OK to be vapid as
long as you're loud.&quot;
</p>
<p>
He may be loud, but vapid he is not. Cuban was the executive producer of the
Enron documentary The Smartest Guys in the Room. He was also behind George
Clooney's Oscar-nominated McCarthyism drama Good Night and Good Luck, and the
powerful look at sexism in Hollywood, Searching for Debra Winger. His
independent-film streak earned him an enemy last year: David Horowitz, the radical turned reactionary.
Horowitz's website FrontPage blared this headline about Cuban: &quot;World's Most
Annoying Sports Fan Now Jihadist Propaganda Producer.&quot; <span class="yshortcuts">Bill O'Reilly</span> called for people to boycott the
Mavericks after the release of an antiwar film produced by Cuban called
Redacted. And Cuban has taken on Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT). Hatch raised
Cuban's ire by sponsoring the Induce Act, a bill that would allow a company to
be sued if it was found to have induced individuals to download Internet music
illegally. Cuban also abhors Hatch for saying that computers storing pirated
downloaded music should be destroyed. On Salt Lake City radio station KCPW,
Cuban said that he thinks the senior Republican is &quot;the digital <span class="yshortcuts">Joe McCarthy</span>.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Cuban embodies a peculiar blend of politics. He touts the credo of the
wealthy: that anyone can make it in America with desire, moxie and elbow grease.
The literary muse of bootstrap billionaires like him is Ayn Rand, the
sleep-inducing author behind <span class="yshortcuts">Atlas
Shrugged</span> and <span class="yshortcuts">The
Fountainhead</span>. Cuban's favorite book is, you guessed it, <u>The Fountainhead</u>.
As he said to Slate, &quot;It was incredibly motivating to me. It encouraged me to
think as an individual, take risks to reach my goals and responsibility for my
successes and failures.&quot;
</p>
<p>
But this hyper-libertarian bootstrap mentality comes into conflict with
Cuban's Pittsburgh populism. When Bush was planning the most expensive
inauguration parties in history, in January 2005, Cuban wrote, &quot;Could there be
anything more confusing and shocking than to read that our country was offering
$35 million in aid to the areas affected by the Tsunamis, but that the cost of
inauguration parties would be about $40 million? Does anyone else think that
this is wrong?&quot; Cuban has also bankrolled a website, <a href="http://sharesleuth.com/" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts">Sharesleuth.com</span></a>, the goal of which is &quot;to create
a new line of defense by using investigative journalism techniques and a
worldwide network of amateur and professional stock detectives to identify
suspect companies.&quot;
</p>
<p>
So far, so good. But he has also made clear that he could use information
that the site uncovers to buy and sell stock. &quot;A journalistic conflict you say?&quot;
Cuban wrote two years ago. &quot;Not anymore. Not in this world. It will be fully
disclosed and explained. This site is for the profit of its owners and we will 
buy and sell stocks that are discussed, before they are made available on the
site...if we can uncover companies whose stock is public and that can be bought
or sold and that allows us to pay for more in depth research and effort. I'm
good with that.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Maybe it's this very confusion, or conflation, of populism
and personal profit that has gotten him into trouble with the SEC. Maybe an
aspect of this has finally caught up with Cuban--the idea that since he lives a
fantasy life, the rules of reality just don't apply. Or maybe he's being
targeted for lacking the bloodlines and birthright to skirt the law. Either way,
Cuban finds himself in a world of trouble. But one thing is certain: when it
comes to Cuban, we will all be able to follow the drama in digital real
time.
