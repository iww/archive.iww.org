<b>1. Appeal for hurricane relief for Haitian workers</b></p><p>
Dear friends and comrades,</p><p>
For two week in late-April and early-May four members of the Industrial Workers of the World traveled to Haiti to meet with labor leaders and document the plight of the Haitian working class. During our trip we encountered a Haiti still reeling from food riots which had gripped it just weeks prior. We found the workers and organizers that we met with
to be extremely competent and passionate, but almost completely immobilized by a severe lack of resources.</p><p>
Now a new crisis grips the Haitian people in the form of over a thousand dead and one million out of a total population nine million people displaced as a result of the recent hurricanes which have battered the island.</p><p>
Haiti's government struggles to respond to what can only be called a humanitarian disaster, but no longer has the infrastructure after years of brutally enforced hollowing out as a result of neo-liberal economic policies. With the shell of the government unable to respond, and profoundly corrupt and bloated NGOs unable deliver aid to where it is needed, the best hope for Haiti lies in the response of citizens and organizers who live and work in the country.</p><p>
The Haitians themselves have the skills, the energy, and the organization to accomplish this task, what they lack is the resources. We are making this urgent appeal for aid in order to help those we met in Haiti, who hosted us in their homes, who fed us when they were hungry, who showed us that they have the know-how and the energy, they just need the resources to get the job done. The International Solidarity Commission of the IWW has established a fund to help get money and aid to the people on the ground that need it most. Please send your donations to:</p><p>
*ISC Haiti Fund c/o General Headquarters PO Box 23085, Cincinnati OH 45223*.</p><p>
Thank you for your support,</p><p>

<b><i>2. IWW News</i><p>
IWW General Assembly held in London, England</p><p></p></b>
For the first time in the union's 103-year history, the IWW General Assembly was held in London, England between August 30th and 31st. In addition to members from Britain, the United States, and Canada, the membership of the German-language area regional organizing committee and Portugal were represented. Union's from continental Europe were also invited to send delegations to the assembly by the IWW General Executive Board, the International Solidarity Commission, and the host London General Membership Branch. Present were members from the Confederation Nationale du Travail (CNT-F), Comités syndicalistes révolutionnaires (CSR), and Workers' Initiative from Poland. On the last day of the assembly, members from each organization spoke about labour struggles and organizing in their respective countries, regions, and industries.</p><p>
<b>IWW, International Support for Fired IWW Cinema Worker<p></p></b>
On the 21st August Chris Lockwood, union organiser and member of the Industrial Workers of the World was fired from his bar job at the Showroom Cinema in Sheffield (UK). In response, the Sheffield IWW organized a picket in front of the cinema on September 12th.</p><p>
The picket was a huge success. Overall, throughout the day, there were probably somewhere between 40-50 Wobblies on the line, and approximately 20-30 at any given time. In addition to Sheffield IWW, members of Leicester, Nottingham, Manchester, Leeds, and London IWW were present. The police presence was minimal, with a few bored cops in a cruiser earlier in the day, and a couple of bike cops who stuck around for an hour or two in the evening before finding something better to do.</p><p>
The support from both movie goers and people passing by was really positive. Picketers were able to turn away a fair number of customers. Some, who already had tickets to a show, chose to support the picket by going for a drink at a local pub around the corner rather than in the cinema bar. Needless to say, most people were surprised at the actions taken by the management of a "progressive", independent cinema, and pledged to call or write letters expressing their concerns. Union members walking the picket line were also happy to see passing taxi and bus drivers honking and waving in support. </p><p>
Support wasn't limited to Wobblies and locals. Sheffield IWW received solidarity letters from the Batay Ouvriye union in Haiti, the Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) in France, and IWW workers from Shattuck Cinema in San Francisco.</p><p>
Perhaps the most impressive factor was the level of support inside the cinema itself amongst the workers. This picket, and the firing of Chris Lockwood, is the culmination of several months of organizing work, which clearly explains management's real motivations for firing Chris. The IWW presence inside the shop seems solid, and with this show of solidarity, is going from strength to strength.</p><p>
<b>Twin Cities Starbucks Worker Reinstated Amidst Heavy Police Presence</b><br />
(compiled from files from <a href="../../">iww.org</a>)</p><p>
Twin Cities IWW members were pleased to hear that Starbucks barista, Erik Forman, had been reinstated with compensation for his unfair dismissal – fired by the multinational coffee chain for union organizing. On August 31st at 1pm the Twin Cities IWW assembled at the Lake and Hiawatha Light Rail Station in solidarity with Starbucks workers and to celebrate Erik Foreman's reinstatement. The rally was a great success with about 100 people showing up. At about 1:45 IWW members legally boarded the light rail (using rail passes) and headed o the Mall of America in order to escort Forman back to his first shift. </p><p>
Everyone was peaceful and orderly on the train as they headed south. At the Bloomington Station they were met by police who asked to speak with the group regarding their plans. They informed the police that they did not wish to cause any trouble, to protest inside of the mall, or to unlawfully assemble in any way inside the mall. The police informed the group that they would not have any trouble. At the Mall of America stop, the train was surrounded by police in full riot gear. They threatened to arrest IWW members if they left the train. They were trapped inside the train for about 20 minutes. The police even prohibited a woman with a child who needed insulin from leaving the train, endangering the child's health. After about 10 minutes and only after repeatedly insisting that they had a
medical emergency did the police permit the woman and child to exit the train. When asked why they were being detained a policeman said: "the mall doesn't want you here." The officers' badge numbers were mostly covered by their gear.</p><p>
After about 20 minutes the police ordered the train back the way it came and, with people stuck inside, they didn't have much choice in the matter. No arrests were reported.</p><p>
This action by the Minneapolis/Bloomington Police Departments is clearly a violation of basic union rights to public picketing, lawful assembly, and further evidence that forces of “law and order” protect corporate capitalism rather than the rights of citizens. </p><p>
<b>Solidarity Requested: Demand the Reinstatement of Joe Richards</b><br />
(compiled from files from <a href="../../">iww.org</a>)</p><p>
On Tuesday, September 2nd, Joe Richard was fired from Ward's Supermarket. He believes, as do his co-workers, that the firing was illegal and was direct retaliation for his workplace organizing efforts. On August 8th, Joe and 14 other employees in the Natural Foods Department submitted a petition to management requesting an increased employee discount (raising it to 20%, which is not uncommon for the industry) and a regular schedule of employee performance evaluations. The petition was largely ignored for three weeks while the owners, Billy and Trish Ward, went on vacation. After they returned, on August 25th they held one-on-one meetings with the employees who signed the petition, elaborating a new 'open door' policy, by which employees could have 100% access to management if they had a concern or grievance. Beyond that, the requests listed in the petition were largely ignored.</p><p>
Just over a week later, Joe was fired, ostensibly for 'stealing' a bag of coffee, which is donated by Sweetwater Coffee Company explicitly for the personal use of Natural Foods Department employees. This free coffee, which was and continues to be intentionally given for employees to drink at work and take home, was routinely taken home and made every morning by numerous Department employees, including Joe. To our knowledge, no employee has ever been punished (either received written warnings or been discharged) for the offense of taking home this free product, which the store never paid a single cent for. Joe did not receive a written warning (as the employee handbook stipulates is appropriate for minor infractions) but was fired two days after checking out with the coffee in hand (buying eggs and donuts as well, on a Sunday morning).</p><p>
It is obvious that Joe was illegally fired for taking part in the petition drive, as someone who vocally and outspokenly supported improvement in the working conditions of all the employees in the store. Having been identified as a 'troublemaker' by the Wards, he was made an example of. As the National Labor Relations Act stipulates in Section (7)a, 'Employees shall have the right to self-organization…for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid of protection.' And thus, 'It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7.' Ward's has broken the law by firing Joe, and they've sent a chilling message to the rest of his co-workers who still insist on bettering their conditions. Please, support the workers at Ward's in their demand for a better life, and support their demand for Joe's immediate reinstatement. What they did is illegal, and the community must not stand for it. We all benefit from having Ward's as an alternative to corporate grocery stores. Because of the important role Ward's plays in our community, it is imperative that they set a high standard in treatment of employees. We expect more from Wards - the community supports them and they should support the community.</p><p>
Here's what you can do to support Joe Richards:</p><p>
1) Call the store and demand that they reinstate Joe. The number is (352) 372-1741 ext. #4.<br />
2) Write a letter to the Wards expressing that this was an illegal firing and demanding reinstatement. The address is 515 NW 23rd Ave, 32601.<br />
3) Tell the Wards the next time you shop that what they've done is illegal and unfitting for a family business that prides itself on being better than Wal-Mart</p><p>
<b><i>2. ISC Action and Events</i><p>
Boston IWW pickets Lionbridge’s global headquarters</p></b></p><p>
IWW members from Boston picketed the global headquarters of translation services provider Lionbridge corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts in late September. The informational picket was an act of solidarity with Jakub G., a member of the ZSP labor union in Poland who was illegally fired by Lionbridge in February for his organizing efforts. Ever since the firing, Jakub and his supporters have been fighting fiercely in the courts and in the media to hold Lionbridge accountable for its actions. On several occasions, unionists around the world staged protests on his behalf. Now, with the recent action by the Boston IWW, this struggle has finally come home to roost at corporate headquarters, forcing company executives to take notice.</p><p>
The informational picket was brief but effective. At one point, IWW members entered Lionbridge’s offices with a banner bearing the IWW’s motto: “An injury to one is an injury to all”. Wobblies also picketed outside the building and at the main entrance to the industrial park in which Lionbridge’s offices are located. Reports and photos have been sent to Jakub and his union, who were excited by the action. Although this action was not as large as some of the previous demonstrations in Europe, it nonetheless shows Lionbridge bosses that the global working class is united and the company cannot commit an injustice across the ocean without facing consequences back home.</p><p>
<b>ISC delegate to attend CNT-F Congress in Lille, France</b></p><p>
The ISC has authorized Michael Ashbrook, of the IWWs German-language area regional organizing committee, as an official delegate to the CNT-F congress in Lille, France from September 19th to 21st. Ashbrook will extend greetings and good wishes on behalf of the IWW and ISC, will report about relevant labor struggles in France including the recent disciplinary of CNT-F postal worker Serge Reynaud (see article below).</p><p>
<b>ISC delegate launches speaking tour in Germany and Sweden</b></p><p>
ISC delegate Stephanie Basile of the New York City General Membership Branch conducted a 7-city speaking tour through Germany (where she addressed the NYC IWW 460 organizing campaign), and in Malmo, Sweden during the European Social Forum. FW Basile will continue to travel and speak in other locations in Europe between September and October. During her tour, FW Basile is also making contacts, exchanging information, and extend greetings to independent labor and working class organizations on behalf of the ISC. For her latest speaking schedule, email <a href="../solidarity%40iww/">solidarity@iww.org</a> </p><p>
<b>ISC releases documentary to raise money and awareness for workers in Haiti</b></p><p>
The ISC’s highly anticipated documentary about our April-May 2008 delegation to Haiti is now available for screenings and individual purchases. The approximately 20-minute video, co-produced by wobbly film-maker Diane Krauthamer and ISC delegates Nathaniel Miller and Justin Vitiello, features interviews and direct footage of Haitian workers and union activists struggling for justice in the midst of government corruption, lack of basic social services, and one of the worst food crises in recent history. All proceeds of the film go to support the rank-and-file organizing efforts of the CTH labor union in Haiti.</p><p>
To order the documentary on DVD or to request a screening in your community, email <a href="../solidarity%40iww/">solidarity@iww.org</a>. The ISC delegates who travelled to Haiti may also be available to speak or introduce the film. </p><p>
<b><i>3. Solidarity Statements and Appeals</i></b></p><p>
<b>Solidarity with Post Worker Serge Reynaud</b></p><p>
The ISC was dismayed to learn that Serge Reynaud, a long-time post worker from Marseille and CNT-F member, was summoned to appear before a disciplinary committee for alleged wrong doing during a strike during the “Postman of the Future program.” This project involves restructuring the entire network by which mail is transported and distributed and could threaten 1000 jobs in the region. It involves closing down sorting centres, regrouping distribution centres, new work norms and speedups, and making workers responsible for their own replacements in case of illness.</p><p>
In response, the ISC issued lodged a letter of protest against this discriminatory action by the French postal service. The letter urged management to drop all charges against Renaud while pointing out the relevant articles and union rights n the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union that this case clearly violates. </p><p>
At the time of writing, the ISC has learned that the disciplinary has been moved to the 26th of September. Also, the Spanish CGT and Workers' Initiative in Poland have organized protests in front of the French embassies in their respective countries.</p><p>
<b>Justice for Kashmiri/Pakistani Seamen,</b></p><p>
The ISC sent a letter strongly protesting the unfair dismissal of 19 Kashmiri and Pakistani seamen, members of the Central Organization of the Workers of Sweden (SAC), working aboard the cruise ship Birger Jarl owned by Rederi Allandia shipping company. </p><p>
Although Rederi Allandia justified the firings on the pretext new European Union (EU) employment legislation makes it more expensive to hire non-EU workers, the ISC noted that Birger Jarl is making a profit. As such, we consider this a clear case of discriminatory firing practices, based on the fact that these workers earned better salaries (under Swedish law) than the cheaper Eastern European labor. The ISC also pointed out that many of the seamen in question have worked for over 20 years aboard this ship and now face possible deportation. In its letter, the ISC demanded the withdrawal of termination notices for all 19 and an immediate end to all harassment of these workers. </p><p>
<b>Solidarity with detained Korean unionists</b></p><p>
The ISC signed on to a statement to the President of South Korea expressing solidarity with members and supporters of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Korean Metal Workers Union who are facing a heavy police crackdown for their peaceful participation in a general strike that swept the country on July 2nd. The statement has been signed by numerous unions and workers rights organizations around the world:</p><p>
The statement calls for the immediately release of all detained union leaders and activists of the KMWU, the dismissal of all charges against them, and the lifting of all pending arrest warrants against other union activists related to the July 2nd strike.</p><p>
The statement declares that these individuals have done nothing other than to carry our their mandate as trade unionists within the framework of ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, which provide for the right to organize, the right to represent workers, and the right to strike.</p><p>
<b>Protesting Police Brutality against Pakistani Workers</b></p><p>
The ISC sent a letter to the government of protesting the police violence and unjustified arrest of workers at the Naveena Textile Factory in Lahore, Pakistan.</p><p>
On July 30, 2008, more than 500 Naveena workers held a protest in front of the factory gate under the banner of All Pakistan Trade Union Federation and the Communist Mazdoor Kisaan party. The workers were protesting the lack of appointment letters, sub-minimum wages, long hours, forced overtime, violations of labor laws and ILO conventions by factory management. At the protest, workers peacefully chanted slogans for the implementation of minimum wage, an end to illegal lockouts, and acceptance of their demands.</p><p>
Suddenly and without provocation, the police charged at the demonstrators, beating them with batons and using tear gas to disperse the crowd. Some workers attempted to defend themselves and the police arrested the leaders of APTUF /CMKP along with 8 workers and took them to an undisclosed location. Hours later they were found at the notorious Chaung police Station.</p><p>
In its letter, the ISC declared its support for the following demand made by the APTUF:</p><p>
-Immediately Reinstate all workers<br />
-Release all arrested workers and leaders<br />
-Increase the minimum wage<br />
-Implement and enforce labor laws</p><p>
The ISC expressed its solidarity with the arrestees and the rest of the Naveena workers and pledged to take whatever further actions are appropriate to see that these injustices are corrected</p><p>
<b>Protesting the Illegal Suspension and Firing of Cambodian Union Leaders</b></p><p>
The ISC wrote a letter to the government of Cambodia and several international monitoring organizations expressing alarm at a wave of suspensions and firings of union leaders working at Seratex Co., LTD, Eayuan (Cambodia) Garment Co., LTD, Shoe Premier Factory and Va Prim Factory over the past eight months. The workers in question are all leaders of the Free Trade Union of the Kingdom of Cambodia (FTUKC), one of the few independent and democratic labor unions in Southeast Asia. The union leaders were suspended and/or fired without being given any reason. It is clear to us that these discipline actions are acts of retaliation to the workers’ union activities.</p><p>
In its letter, the ISC points out that these suspensions and firings constitute anti-union discrimination in violation of the labor laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia and ILO Conventions 87 and 111.</p><p>
Echoing a formal request to the Ministry of Labor by FTUKC leader Chea Mony, the ISC urged the Government of Cambodia to take prompt action against the law-breaking companies and to order the reinstatement and proper compensation of those union leaders who have been unjustly suspended or fired.</p><p>
<b>Protesting government repression of unionists in Iran</b></p><p>
The ISC wrote a letter to the government of Iran expressing outrage at the government’s recent wave of repression against independent unionists. In the letter, the ISC cited the following cases:</p><p>
- Ms. Sousan Razani and Ms. Shiva Kheirabadi each were sentenced to 4 months imprisonment and 15 lashes; Mr. Abdullah Khani was sentenced to 91 days prison and 40 lashes and Mr. Seyed Qaleb Hosseini was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and 50 lashes. The verdict was issued by the Criminal Court of Sanandaj-branch 101. The above labor activists are sentenced so severely only because of their participation in 2008 May Day celebration in Sanandaj. In addition, Mr. Khaled Hosseini, a worker activist, was sentenced to 91 days suspended jail and 30 lashes because of his efforts in support of Mahmoud Salehi who was imprisoned at the time.</p><p>
- On July 20, 2008, Mr. Farzad Kamangar was sentenced to death after having a seven minute-trial. Farzad Kamangar is a teacher, who has been brutally tortured because of unsubstantiated allegations such as collaborating with the Pejak Party, membership in the PKK, and transporting explosives, Many individuals and organizations from Iran and abroad have protested his detention and the recent death sentence against him but your government has disregarded all these pleas.</p><p>
- Another activist, Mr. Afshin Shams, was arrested in July 2008. Mr. Shams is a labor activist and a member of several workers rights and civil society organizations.
</p><p>
- Mansour Osanloo, the president of Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, has been imprisoned since July 2007 and is serving a five year jail term for his union activities.
</p><p> - There have been other arrests and charges against labor and social activists in Iran as well as dismissal of labor activists, including the recent dismissal verdict against nine members of the bus workers union.</p><p>
All the above arrests and repressive measures are clear indications of intensified offensives against the entire labor movement in Iran. The ISC called on the government of Iran to unconditionally and immediately release all prisoners of conscious and repeal all charges and sentences against labor activists in Iran. The ISC further demanded the immediate recognition and realization of human rights to all workers in Iran, including the rights to organize freely and to strike.</p><p>
