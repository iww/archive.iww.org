By John J. Cronan Jr - originally published on <a href="http://www.zmag.org/sustainers/content/2007-12/26cronan_jr.cfm" target="_blank">ZNet</a>, December 26, 2007
</p>
<p>
In
the United States, we can see the roots of an emerging militant labor
movement. Though in its infancy, rank-and-file initiatives are becoming
more common as traditional Labor continues to fail us. A militant labor
movement will be comprised of (or at least should be) self-managed
workers' organizations; subsequently, labor activists focus on
organizing the rank-and-file workers. This much I think we can all
agree on. However, there is disagreement on what the role of a militant
labor movement and organizing around class has in the context of
greater societal change. I think that much of the disagreement stems
from, in general terms, how we conceptualize how societal change
happens, and who are the agents of change. It is this question that I
will try to address, presenting a complementary and holistic approach
that recognizes the centrality of non-class oppressions, along with
class, in the struggle for radical societal change.
</p>
<p>
In all human societies there are four spheres of social activity:
economic, political, cultural/community, and kinship. And in each
sphere there are different oppressions based on various factors: In the
economic sphere, there is class oppression; in the political sphere,
there is oppression based on the order giver/order takers relationship,
usually embodied in the authoritarian state; in the community/cultural
sphere, oppression is based on race, ethnicity, and religion; and in
the kinship sphere, oppression is based on sex, gender and sexual
identity and orientation, and age . If we think that societal change, a
liberated society, is going to arise mainly from radical economic
change, because that has the most influence, then we will identify
workers as the central agent of change. Someone can have this view and
still be sensitive to the existence of, and need to combat, other forms
of oppression. Therefore, you don't necessarily have to be
&quot;economistic&quot; or a &quot;workerist&quot; to hold this view; but even though you
may recognize other oppressions, class is held as the most central and
critical to change.
</p>
<p>
Following this line of thought, strategies arise about how to deal with
other oppressions, such as sexism, racism, heterosexism, etc. Two are
most common. There is the &quot;Unite and Fight&quot; argument: race, gender,
etc. only divides us, so let's put that aside and unite as the working
class. The other is a bit more subtle and strategic: race, gender, etc.
are important and the oppressions that stem from them are real and they
need to be addressed because the working class is heterogeneous, and
not to do so would inhibit class unity. The latter is better than the
former but it's still a problem.
</p>
<p>
Now, things change if we look at how to make radical change from a
different angle. Instead of holding economics as central (even if we
acknowledge the importance of other spheres of life), we look at change
in a more complementary and holistic way. In this view, radical change
is looked at in the context of all four spheres-understanding how parts
of the whole are interdependent and relate to one another. Therefore,
with this analysis, who are the agents of change? In the economic, it's
the working class. In the political, it's citizens/current
order-takers. In the cultural/community, it's oppressed ethnic groups
and people of color; and in kinship, it's women, transfolk, queers,
youth and older folk. However, these spheres do not exist independently
from each other, obviously. But, rather, they are highly entwined. The
hierarchies in each sphere are so embedded that they can actually
define and shape the institutional roles and relations of the other
spheres. For example, in the workplace we have seen how the division of
labor has been shaped by sexist and heterosexist societal norms (among
others). We see that the constructed role of women as caretakers and
nurturers within the family has resulted in them occupying positions
like nurses and hostesses, overwhelmingly. We see there is actually a
sexual division of labor that is not necessarily inevitable in a given
economy.
</p>
<p>
If we take this approach, a much different strategy evolves, and the
way we view workers organizations will, also. And, ironically, we'll
also see that even if you think class is central, by ignoring the equal
importance of the other spheres, you get class wrong.
</p>
<p>
As far as strategy goes, with this approach, instead of trying to
merely unite workers along class lines, we appeal to class interests,
as well as giving oppressed groups autonomous spaces within the workers
movement, such as caucuses. Not only does this provide space where
oppressed groups can possibly get together to talk about and air
grievances, but it actually allows the workers movement to be better
able to address the ways that hierarchies in other spheres have shaped
class and the economic realm. Also, we will be better able to organize
workers because we will not be telling people which oppression they
feel and which they shouldn't! We no longer only worry about how other
oppressions divide the working class, but rather we will have a better
understanding of how race, gender, sexuality, and authority shape class
relations. It will help the labor movement become more strategic in how
we approach workers-avoiding reproducing oppressive norms within our
organizations-and will inform us on what reforms to fight for. For
example, the labor movement could fight to overcome the sexual and
racial division of labor in the workplace. This approach will also have
implications for movement building in general. No longer will we feel
the necessity to assimilate women's, queer, national minority, etc,
movements into the workers' movement as the sole movement. Rather, we
have Autonomy within Solidarity, with each movement setting the agenda
for its respective area of influence for the larger &quot;Movement of
Movements.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Now here is the ironic part I briefly mentioned, and, I believe, to be
the most important. Say you think that everything that I just said is
wrong and muddleheaded, and you believe issues like gender are
secondary to class-whether this is theoretical and/or strategic. You
believe that class is central and it radiates its influence to all
other spheres (which I believe it does, but so do the others), then it
becomes ever more important that you focus on the other spheres because
they are are going to be shaped by oppressive class norms and
hierarchies!! For example, since kinship relations were adapted to and
shaped by class rule, they actually have the ability to reproduce the
same oppressive economic hierarchies. Therefore, if we have an economic
revolution-where the fundamental economic institutions are replaced
with truly classless, participatory ones-but the oppressions within
kinship are not given as much attention as they should and still remain
unscathed, we run the risk of the same oppressive class hierarchies and
norms coming back into existence in the economic sphere, rolling back
the gains that were made. Why? Because the institutional roles within
kinship have been shaped and defined by oppressive class relations to
the point where these relations are reproduced by the kinship sphere.
Hence the irony. By putting secondary importance to issues like gender,
the class advocate actually gets class wrong. This holds true with
oppressions in all four spheres.
</p>
<p>
What I have argued up to this point, is not to say that all workers
must be anti-racist, feminist, queer liberationist, non-ageist,
ant-authoritarians right off the bat. In fact, this would fly in the
face of the analysis I am putting forth. What I am saying, however, is
that if a militant labor movement is going to come to being that can
actually challenge economic hegemony by the ruling few, and build a
classless society, then we are going to have to address the oppressions
that stem from political, community and cultural, and kinship
relations. We cannot have a labor movement that reproduces the
hierarchies of oppressions based in other spheres of life. We will need
to do this in order to organize workers in the first place, and to
ensure that when we do win fundamental economic change, it will be
truly liberatory and long lasting. Some organizations are taking the
steps down the right path; however, if we are to build a militant labor
movement-with a complementary and holistic approach-that is part of an
ever greater Movement for a participatory society, much work is to be
done. And I hope what I have presented will contribute at least
something to this.
