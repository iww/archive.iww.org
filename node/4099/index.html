<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080421/ehrenreich" target="_blank"><strong>By Barbara Ehrenreich - <em>The Nation</em>, April 7, 2008</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
Until the beginning of this month, Americans seemed to have nothing to
say about their ongoing economic ruin except, &quot;Hit me! Please, hit me
again!&quot; You can take my house, but let me mow the lawn for you one more
time before you repossess. Take my job and I'll just slink off somewhere
out of sight. Oh, and take my health insurance too; I can always fall
back on Advil.
</p>
<p>
Then, on April 1, in a wave of defiance, truck drivers began taking the
strongest form of action they can take: <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h754857XlNi4En4IBAv5GxRgEYhQD8VPC1380">inaction</a>.
Faced with $4-per-gallon diesel fuel, they slowed down, shut down and
started honking. On the New Jersey Turnpike, a convoy of trucks
stretching &quot;as far as the eye can see,&quot; according to a turnpike
spokesman, drove at a glacial 20 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
Outside of Chicago, they slowed and drove three abreast, blocking
traffic and taking arrests. They jammed into Harrisburg, Pennsylvania;
they slowed down the Port of Tampa, where fifty rigs sat idle in
protest. Near Buffalo, one driver told the press he was taking the week
off &quot;to pray for the
economy.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The truckers who organized the protests--by CB radio and Internet--have
a specific goal: reducing the price of diesel fuel. They are
owner-operators, meaning they are also businesspeople, and they can't
break even with current fuel costs. They want the government to release
its fuel reserves. They want an investigation into oil company profits
and government subsidies of the oil companies. Of the drivers I talked
to, all were acutely aware that the government had found, in the course
of a weekend, $30 billion to bail out Bear Stearns, while their own
businesses are in a tailspin.
</p>
<p>
But the truckers' protests have ramifications far beyond the
owner-operators' plight--first, because trucking is hardly a marginal
business. You may imagine, here in the blogosphere, that everything
important travels at the speed of pixels bouncing off of satellites, but
70 percent of the nation's goods--from Cheerios to Chapstick--travel
by truck. We were able to survive a writers' strike, but a trucking
strike would affect a lot more than your viewing options. As Donald
Hayden, a Maine trucker put it to me: &quot;If all the truckers decide to
shut this country down, there's going to be nothing they can do about
it.&quot;
</p>
<p>
More importantly, the activist truckers understand their protest to be
part of a larger effort to &quot;take back America,&quot; as one put it to me. &quot;We
continue to maintain this is not just about us,&quot; JB--which is his CB
handle and stands for the &quot;Jake Brake&quot; on large rigs-- told me from a
rest stop in Virginia on his way to Florida. &quot;It's about everybody--the
homeowners, the construction workers, the elderly people who can't
afford their heating bills... This is not the action of the truck
drivers, but of the people.&quot; Hayden mentions his parents, ages and 81
and 76, who've fought the Maine winter on a fixed income. Missouri-based
driver Dan Little sees stores shutting down in his little town of
Carrollton. &quot;We're Americans,&quot; he tells me, &quot;We built this country, and
I'll be damned if I'm going to lie down and take this.&quot;
</p>
<p>
At least one of the truckers' tactics may be translatable to the
foreclosure crisis. On March 29, Hayden <a href="http://bangornews.com/news/t/news.aspx?articleid=162283&amp;zoneid=5">surrendered</a>
three rigs to be repossessed by Daimler-Chrysler--only he did it
publicly, with flair, right in front of the statehouse in Augusta.
&quot;Repossession is something people don't usually see,&quot; he says, and he
wanted the state legislature to take notice. As he took the keys, the
representative of
Daimler-Chrysler said, according to Hayden, &quot;I don't see why you
couldn't make the payments.&quot; To which Hayden responded, &quot;See, I have to
pay for fuel and food, and I've eaten too many meals in my life to give
that up.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Suppose homeowners were to start making their foreclosures into public
events--inviting the neighbors and the press, at least getting someone
to camcord the children sitting disconsolately on the steps and the
furniture spread out on the lawn. Maybe, for a nice dramatic touch, have
the neighbors shower the bankers, when they arrive, with dollar bills
and loose change, since those bankers never can seem to get enough.
</p>
<p>
But the larger message of the truckers' protest is about pride or, more
humbly put, self-respect, which these men channel from their roots. Dan
Little tells me, &quot;My granddad said, and he was the smartest man I ever
knew, 'If you don't stand up for yourself, ain't nobody gonna stand up
for you.'&quot; Go to <a href="http://www.theamericandriver.com/home.html">TheAmericanDriver.com</a>,
run by JB and his brother in Texas, where you're greeted by a giant
American flag, and you'll find--among the driving tips, weather info,
and drivers' favorite photos--the entire Constitution and Declaration
of Independence. &quot;The last time we faced something as impacting on us,&quot;
JB tells me, &quot;There was a
revolution.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The actions of the first week in April were just the beginning. There's
talk of a protest in Indiana on April 18, another in New York City, and
a giant convergence of trucks on DC on April 28. Who knows what it will
all add up to? Already, according to JB, some of the big trucking
companies are threatening to fire any of their employees who join the
owner-operators' protests.
</p>
<p>
But at least we have one shining example of defiance of the face of
economic assault. There comes a point, sooner or later, when you stop
scrambling around on all fours and, like JB and his fellow drivers all
over the country, you finally stand up.
