<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_02/b4115026911242.htm" target="_blank"><strong>By Moira Herbst - <em>BusinessWeek</em>, December 31, 2008 </strong></a>
</p>
<p>
Starbucks (<a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=SBUX" target="_blank">SBUX</a>),
once the undisputed leader in premium-price caffeine fixes, has long
cultivated a corporate image for social responsibility, environmental
awareness, and sensitivity to workers' rights. Now that carefully
crafted reputation is under assault, thanks to a messy legal dispute
with a group called the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) (part of the
Industrial Workers of the World, or IWW), which started recruiting
employees in 2004 and now claims 300 members.
</p>
<p>
The National Labor Relations Board found on Dec. 23 that <a rel="topic" href="https://bx.businessweek.com/starbucks/" target="_blank">Starbucks</a>
had illegally fired three New York City baristas as it tried to squelch
the union organizing effort. The 88-page ruling also says the company
broke the law by giving negative job evaluations to other union
supporters and prohibiting employees from discussing union issues at
work. The judge ordered that the three baristas be reinstated and
receive back wages. The judge also called on Starbucks to end
discriminatory treatment of other <a rel="topic" href="https://bx.businessweek.com/labor-unions/" target="_blank">pro-union</a>
workers at four Manhattan locations named in the case. The decision
marks the end of an 18-month trial in New York City that pitted the
ubiquitous multinational corporation against <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/aug2007/db20070817_127354.htm" target="_blank">a group of twentysomething baristas</a> who are part of the Industrial Workers of the World.
</p>
<p>
The timing isn't ideal for Starbucks, which faces lower demand from the
recession, an overall loss of panache for the brand, and a sliding
stock price. &quot;[The ruling] is a real thumb in the eye—a real gotcha
moment with potential for heartache,&quot; says Eric Dezenhall, chief
executive officer of Dezenhall Resources, a crisis management public
relations firm in Washington D.C. &quot;I don't think it's a crisis, but it
hovers between [being] a nuisance and a problem.&quot;
</p>
<h3>eyeing 401(k) contributions</h3>
<p>
Starbucks intends to appeal the decision. The company maintained
during the trial that the baristas were fired for perfectly legal
reasons, such as disrupting business in its stores or threatening a
manager. &quot;This is an issue with particular employees,&quot; says Tara
Darrow, a Starbucks spokeswoman. &quot;We felt we handled it consistently
and fairly. In this particular situation the NLRB disagreed. We're
disappointed with that.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The ruling comes at a time when Starbucks is trying to get its
groove back in a very grim economy. The company's shares more than
halved in value in 2008, now trading just above $9, while <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?capId=4245496" target="_blank">Dunkin Donuts</a> and McDonald's (<a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=MCD" target="_blank">MCD</a>)
continued to grab market share among coffee drinkers. As the recession
deepens, Starbucks recently said it may end or trim contributions to
workers' 401(k) accounts in 2009.
</p>
<p>
While the New York case marks the first that has gone to trial,
Starbucks has been the target of numerous National Labor Relations
Board complaints over unlawful violations of workers' rights. Starbucks
settled another case in New York concerning illegal firings for union
activity without admitting guilt in March 2006, paying $2,000 to former
employees and offering their jobs back. In early October 2008,
Starbucks settled the case of barista Erik Forman, who was fired for
talking with co-workers about managers' apparent efforts to fire him
for union organizing at a Minneapolis location. Starbucks ultimately
invited Forman back to work. A similar case is getting under way in
Grand Rapids, Mich.; the trial is expected to begin Jan. 7.
</p>
<p>
Employees involved in the New York case insist the company went to
great lengths to shut down union organizers. The &quot;decision shows that
Starbucks will go to great lengths to interfere with workers' freedom
of association,&quot; says 29-year-old Daniel Gross, who has led Starbucks'
organizing efforts in Manhattan and helped initiate the case. &quot;It's
clear that [Starbucks] Chairman [Howard] Schultz has an animosity for
workers articulating an independent voice.&quot;
</p>
<h3>&quot;Direct Action&quot; Union Tactics</h3>
<p>
Founded in 1905, the IWW has a colorful history of workplace
agitation. The &quot;Wobblies,&quot; as they were known, included prominent labor
leaders such as Eugene Debs, Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones, and William
&quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood. Their goal was to bring all workers into &quot;One Big
Union&quot; and ultimately to abolish the wage labor system. Rather than try
to negotiate with companies through contract bargaining or support
political candidates, the IWW engages in what Gross and others call
&quot;direct action.&quot; It pressures companies like Starbucks by assaulting
their public image, picketing stores, and organizing Internet
campaigns.
</p>
<p>
The SWU is especially keen on tarnishing Starbucks' image as a
&quot;socially responsible&quot; company. Gross says Starbucks has a systematic
problem with low wages, irregular working hours, and a lack of reliable
health care. One statistic the union likes to point to is that only 42%
of Starbucks workers use its health-care plan—even lower than the rate
at Wal-Mart. Starbucks maintains that it pays competitive wages and is
among the first large employers to offer health insurance to part-time
employees, who make up 100% of its workforce.
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, consumers don't stop patronizing companies that
encounter labor problems. But Starbucks, with its carefully cultivated
reputation for social responsibility, may be an exception. &quot;Bad news is
bad news,&quot; says Robert Passikoff, founder and president of the retail
consulting firm <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?capId=22850376" target="_blank">Brand Keys</a>
in New York. &quot;People who are paying attention to [employee relations]
tend to be in Starbucks' core audience. It's part and parcel of the
image of a brand that is wonderful being green, promoting free trade,
and helping people, and not being an oppressor of labor.&quot;
