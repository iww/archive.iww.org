<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>The employer's machines
have a valve that we working people do not. For the most part the machines
are not abused, and if a worker uses a machine in a manner that may damage
it the employer will get more than a bit upset. The machine is a capital
investment, the worker, beyond possible training, is not. The worker can
be abused and damaged, for they can be replaced easily. But some times
when working long hours you begin to feel like a machine with the only
purpose of existing is that of working.
</p>
<p>Within each person there is a creative spirit. Something that drives us
to do things creatively that we enjoy. We like to create things, many times
just for the act of creating alone. To draw, paint, write, make music,
to make things out of wood or stone, or to grow a garden. Each person is
different in their creativeness, likes and dislikes. Alone with our relationships,
our creative spirit is what makes life worth living. When we work long
hours our creative spirit becomes unfulfilled. We start to lose our individuality
and self-worth. We become like ants in a mass of production. Work to live,
live to work.
</p>
<p>Our creative spirit can do many amazing things. And we need to turn that
spirit into a struggle to reclaim our lives back from those who believe
that they own us.</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR TEN</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a zombie
movie where the zombies are moving around and performing physical functions,
but you look into their eyes and you know something is missing? A soul
or spirit or something. Round about the tenth hour I begin to feel like
that.
</p>
<p>Yes, I'm still functioning but something is missing. If it were not for
the fact of all the small pains in my body, I may even question if I were
still living.
</p>
<p>When we sleep, eat and exist all for just one purpose, that being to work,
we are nothing more than a 24 hour slave. We are robbed of all else that
should be a part of living. The boss is the slave master who drives us
to toil. And to the master, the slave should not think beyond work, should
not care about anything beyond the job, should not have desires more than
producing profits, they should only perform their required tasks. Those
functions off the job exist only for the slave to replenish themselves
for more work. The slave must eat, sleep and reproduce new slaves.
</p>
<p>For payment for being a slave we are given wages. But we turn around and
give our wages right back to the class that we received them from to pay
for those things that we need to continue to produce for our masters, a
place to sleep, food to eat, transportation to and from work.
</p>
<p>For all that is meaningful and sacred, the earth was not created for a
few to plunder, and the many were not created to be slaves for those few.
The slaves can resist; the slaves can rebel; the slaves can take back that
which is rightful theirs. The slaves can do away with all masters and slaves
and replace them with free people acting for the well-being of all.</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR ELEVEN</p>
<p>This is the hour that your
body finally goes into 'automatic pilot'. It is too early to start thinking
about quitting time, so you just function. The pusherman comes by and voices
his verbal whipping; "work harder, don't you care about your job?" You
would like to strangle the bastard just to see him die. But you don't,
you just keep toiling away, mentally cursing life itself.
</p>
<p>That ever important machine, the employer will pay for all its upkeep.
If the machine needs some form of energy to power it, that also the employer
will pay for. The employer will pay to shelter the machine from the weather.
But working people must pay the employing class for these necessities that
are needed for us to continue to produce for them. Why do we do this? Why
are we such accepting slaves? Because we are conditioned to believe that
this is the best of all possible systems. That the freedom to be a slave
is what freedom means.
</p>
<p>Freedom has come to mean two different things. There is the freedom of
the employers and the freedom of the workers. For the employers there is
freedom to exploit, the freedom to abuse working people, the freedom to
plunder the earth, the freedom to become rich off the labor of others.
To protect that freedom there are governments, laws police and the military.
For the workers there is freedom to be exploited, freedom to be abused
by the bosses, the freedom to chose their abusers, the freedom to buy our
needs from the owning class, and the freedom to be homeless, hungry and
die if we freely chose not to be freely exploited. These great freedoms
are protected by the government, laws, the police and military. We are
truly blessed to live with such great freedoms, are we not?</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR TWELVE</p>
<p>After a while working every
day drags on you and it becomes harder to talk
yourself into coming in every day. People start to take weekends off. On
the job that I have based this writing on, so many people were taking weekends
off that the employer posted signs that read "If you don't work the weekend,
you will be laid off on Monday." The idea was to get rid of the bad slaves
and replace them with new good slaves.
</p>
<p>Pipefitting on a ship takes a lot of thought and imagination. You cannot
just fit two lengths of pipe together, for on a ship there are many obstacles
and other considerations. You have to be able to see angles in your mind.
Every offset is a degrees that is an interception of two lines on a circular
arc. On a ship most pipes square to forward and aft or port and starboard.
This means that when you make an offset, at any degrees, most of the time
you must return to square of any of those directions. Thus, to get around
an obstacle it often requires two offsets. You may find that it is not
possible to run your pipe at the same elevation as where your first offset
is. Then you must figure the point to begin your offset, the degrees of
your offset, how long your offset will be, and if you must raise or lower
your pipe, every amount that it moves will add length to your pipe getting
from point A to point B, then you may find that you are able to only run
a short ways before you must offset out of the way of something else. This
means that one piece of pipe could have a number of offsets in it. Then
sometimes you are running two pipes together which means you have to figure
parallel offsets.
</p>
<p>Making mistakes in your figuring could cause bad results. If you are off
in your figuring and you are too tired to give a damn about what you are
doing, you may force two pipes together rather than refitting them. When
you do that you have created stress in the pipe. When there is stress in
a pipe there is a point where the stress is the greatest. This is called
a stress point. If that stress point is where two pipes are joined together
that could produce a leak over time. At sea everything on a ship stretches.
If that stress point is on a fuel system or seawater intake a leak can
cause you real trouble.
</p>
<p>There are many other mistakes that can be made, like welding or burning
next to fuel lines , ventilation uptakes, or foam initiation. It is hard
enough to get everything done right and watch out for dangers when working
an eight hour day, but when you are working more hours than that, with
each additional hour you work mistakes increase.
</p>
<p>You may think "well so what? I don't ride ships". And maybe you don't care
about possible ecological damage. But think about this; forced overtime
is common in most construction, including such things as nuclear power
plants and airplanes. And no amount of inspectors can catch every mistake.
The next time you are up there thousands of feet in the air in a plane,
think about what I have said about forced overtime. Consider that the plane
could have been built by tired workers. Then ask yourself if the eight
hour day is also your issue.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
