<div class="article-inner clearfix">
<p>The only way that I have found to handle long hours is to keep my
mind off the time. I will not even let myself think about what I wish
to do
after work. I try to keep moving at a steady pace, for if I slow down
or stop working weariness will set in. Sometimes I am unable to keep my
thoughts from turning to anger over my situation. But there is a good
side to such anger, it will gave you an adrenaline rush that will keep
you
awake. </p>
<p>The politicians will pass many so-called labor laws, but they don't
mean a damn thing if they are not enforced. It is a very clear fact
that
most labor laws (that is those that benefit working people) are not
enforced like those laws that benefit the employers. While the police
will
throw some worker in jail for breaking a law that protects the
employers, how often have you heard of an employer being arrested and
jailed for
breaking a law that protects a worker? </p>
<p>For example; if a worker steals from an employer, that worker can be
arrested and jailed. But if an employer withholds money due to a
worker,
and that is stealing, then the worker must take that employer to court.
Or if a worker goes out and kills someone that is called murder, but if
an
employer knowingly creates a situation that causes the deaths of
workers, the most that may happen is that they must pay a fine. </p>
<p>Many labor laws sound nice on paper, but more often than not, their only
purpose is to deceive working people into thinking they have something,
when in reality they have next to nothing at all. It is the old smoke and
mirror trick. The following are some of the ways they keep labor laws impotent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
They will
pass a law and not give any agency the authorization to enforce it.</li>
<br />
<li>
If they
do give it to an agency, they may under fund that agency so that it does
not have the ability to enforce the law.</li>
<br />
<li>
Sometimes
they will follow the letter of the law but not the intent of the law. I
was worked an overhaul of a large boiler on a ship that was covered with
asbestos insulation. Each morning before we went to work there was a test
for asbestos in the air. There was only one 12 hour shift working this
job. So they were doing their test after the asbestos had 12 hours to settle.
So were we being projected by the intent of the law? Hell no. Once we started
to work the asbestos dust was kicked up again.</li>
<br />
<li>
A large
percentage of employers violate heath, safety, environmental and other
labor laws because it is profitable to do so. The reason is that enforcement
is so weak that most of them never get caught. And if they do get caught
the fines are so small that it is even then more profitable to break the
laws. Some companies even go as far as doing cost analysis on breaking
laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the
government was serious about their labor laws the formula for enforcement
would be something like this. The forfeiting of all profits made while
the law was being broken, additional fines and the same type of criminal
liability that exists in the rest of society for deaths and injuries from
the result of breaking laws.
</p>
<p>Many states in the U.S. have overtime laws, and this you will have to research
to know if they cover you or not. The federal law covering time worked
is called the Fair Labor Standards Act. The agency that has jurisdiction
of the law is the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor.
Basically what this law says is that any worker (that is those that are
covered by the law) that works over 40 hours a week must be paid no less
than time and a half for overtime hours. The law does not set any industrial
standards that limits the amount hours workers can be forced to work.
</p>
<p>To depend upon politicians, laws and bureaucracies to safeguard the interest
of working people is foolish. Everything we have gained has come from the
direct result of working class economic force or threat of force. And every
gain that we will keep will also be the result of the same.
</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR THREE</p>
<p>Time starts to drag in the
third hour. A numbness sets in and apathy to your situation engulfs you.
All there is in life is work. The next piece of pipe to fit, the next flange
to tighten. Life is work, and work is life, all else is but a dream created
in ones imagination to pass the time.
</p>
<p>The employers are working us longer hours because it profits them to do
so. More hours means less employees, and less workers means having to pay
less benefits (if there are any) and less costs in Workers Compensation
Insurance and other such things.
</p>
<p>I have seen on many jobs where some workers will even compete with each
other to see who can work the most hours. I guess it is some type of macho
thing, a real man can work forever. I have often wondered if the definition
of a real man is having nothing between their ears. Poor foolish slaves.
They don't seem to understand that no matter how much money one can make,
you cannot buy back your life. And the boss is laughing at you all the
way to the bank. A sucker is born everyday they say.
</p>
<p>Some of the union bosses have gotten into this scam. In some of the business
unions, you not only pay your dues, but also the union gets a percentage
of all your wages. Thus, when you work overtime they get more money. And
the union boss is laughing at you all the way to the bank. A sucker is
born everyday they say.</p>
<p class="redbar">HOUR FOUR</p>
<p>This may be the most dangerous
hour of the day. It is still too early to think about your lunch break,
and the tiredness of your mind and body leaves you vulnerable to the dangers
around you. It is hard to explain to someone who has never worked 14 hours
a day, 7 days a week the true reality of being tired without end. Things
that you would not think were possible, become ordinary. I have fallen
asleep with a 10 pound sledgehammer in my hands while slamming steamjoints.
If the mind and body are tired enough you can fall asleep doing most anything.
Without knowing it you become careless. You may drop a tool or a part while
momentarily dosing. Or you may see a danger, but your reaction time is
too slow to act. Things around you seem to move in slow motion, but your
motion is even slower. Sometimes you are so exhausted that you may see
a danger, but you just stand there because you just don't give a damn anymore.
I remember once taking a fall and rather than being hit with fear I felt
a peaceful feeling of relief as I fell.
</p>
<p>The body and mind needs not only sleep, but also rest from work. Long hours
do not give you either. Off the job if you intentionally place someone
in a situation that could cause injury or death, you would find yourself
in a prison cell. But everyday employers place workers in that situation,
and if someone is hurt or is killed, they call it just an industrial accident.
A dead or injured worker can be replaced.
</p>
<p>Now you may say to yourself that you don't work in such places as shipyards,
so why should you give a damn about some poor yardbird who you have never
met? But think about this, that damn old yardbird ain't the only one not
getting the rest that they should. Everyday, on every highway in America,
there are truck drivers driving rigs weighing thousands of pounds, who
are just as exhausted as that old yardbird. So as you are driving your
little car to and from wherever, the driver in that big rig next to you
could be driving in a state of great fatigue. This is something that I
understand, for I have also been a long haul driver. I can tell you about
driving hour after hour, day after day, sometimes up to six months at a
time without anything more than time off to sleep, eat and shit every ten
hours. Thousands of people die every year from truck car accidents and
one of the main causes is the fatigue of the driver.
</p>
<p>Have you ever seen what happens when a car and big rig get all tangled
up? If you truly understand what I am trying to say to you you will understand
why the eight hour day is important to you directly.</p> <div id="book-navigation-6767" class="book-navigation">
