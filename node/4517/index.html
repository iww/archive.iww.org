On the morning of Wed. (17 December 2008), the offices of the G.S.E.E. (at
the intersection of Patision St. and Alexandras St.) were occupied by insurgent
workers and the building was declared a liberated workers' zone. Their
declaration speaks of their wish &quot;[t]o disperse the media-touted myth that the
workers were and are absent from the clashes, and that the rage of these days
was an affair of some 500 &quot;mask-bearers,&quot; &quot;hooligans&quot; or some other such fairy
tale, while on the T.V. screens the workers were presented as victims of the
clash, while the capitalist crisis in Greece and worldwide continues to lead to
countless layoffs that the media and their managers portray as a &quot;natural
phenomenon&quot;.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
<strong>Communique #1 (17 December 2008):</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div>
We will either determine our history ourselves or let it be determined
without us.
</div>
<br />
<div>
We, manual workers, employees, jobless, temporary workers, local or
migrants, are not passive T.V. viewers. Since the murder of Alexandros
Grigoropoulos on Saturday night, we participate in the demonstrations, the
clashes with the police, the occupations of the centre or the neighborhoods.
Time and time again we had to leave our jobs and our daily obligations to take
the streets with the students, the university students and the other
proletarians in the struggle.
</div>
<br />
<div>
WE DECIDED TO OCCUPY THE BUILDING OF G.S.E.E.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- To turn it into a space of free expression and a meeting point of
workers.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- To disperse the media-touted myth that the workers were and are absent
from the clashes, and that the rage of these days was an affair of some 500
&quot;mask-bearers,&quot; &quot;hooligans&quot; or some other fairy tale, while on the T.V. screens
the workers were presented as victims of the clash, while the capitalist crisis
in Greece and worldwide continues to lead to countless layoffs that the media
and their managers deal as a &quot;natural phenomenon&quot;.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- To flay and uncover the role of the trade union bureaucracy in the
undermining of the insurrection.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- And not only this. The G.S.E.E. and the entire trade union mechanism
that supports it, for decades and decades, undermine struggles, trades our labor
power for crumbs, perpetuates the system of exploitation and wage slavery. The
stance of G.S.E.E. last Wednesday is quite telling: G.S.E.E. canceled the
programmed strikers' demonstration, stopping short and calling a brief gathering
in Syntagma Square, making sure that the people would be dispersed in a hurry
from the Square, fearing that they might get infected by the virus of
insurrection.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- To open up this space for the first time as a continuation of the social
opening created by the insurrection itself, a space that has been built by our
contributions, a space from which we were excluded. For all these years we
trusted our fate to saviors of every kind, and we end up losing our dignity. As
workers we have to start assuming our responsibilities, and to stop assigning
our hopes to wise leaders or &quot;able&quot; representatives. We have to acquire a voice
of our own, to meet up, to talk, to decide, and to act. Against the generalized
attack that we endure. The creation of collective &quot;grassroots&quot; resistance is the
only way.
</div>
<br />
<div>
-- To propagate the idea of self-organization and solidarity in working
places, committees and collective grassroots procedures, abolishing the
bureaucratic trade unionists.
</div>
<br />
<div>
All these years we gulp the misery, the pandering, the violence at work. We
became accustomed to counting the crippled and our dead in so-called &quot;labor
accidents&quot;. We became accustomed to ignoring the migrants -- our class brothers
and sisters -- getting killed. We are tired of living with the anxiety of
securing a wage, revenue stamps, and a pension that now feels like a distant
dream.
</div>
<br />
<div>
As we struggle not to abandon our life to the hands of the bosses and the
trade union representatives, likewise we will not abandon a single arrested
insurgent in the hands of the state and the juridical mechanism.
</div>
<br />
<div>
IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE DETAINED.
</div>
<br />
<div>
NO CHARGE TO THE ARRESTED.
</div>
<br />
<div>
SELF-ORGANIZATION OF THE WORKERS.

<div>

<strong>Communique #2 (17 December 2008)</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div>
An offhand answer to &quot;Mr.&quot; Panagopoulos regarding his statements on NET
channel (a state-run T.V. station in Greece).
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;Mister&quot; Panagopoulos stated on the channel, that &quot;some youngsters occupied
the building of G.S.E.E. [...] if they were manual workers, they'd be on
building sites now [...]&quot;.
</div>
<br />
<div>
This unearthy subject, belonging to the managerial staff of National Bank
of Greece, that &quot;represents&quot; the workers, where is he himself now, and what does
he know about building sites?
</div>
<br />
<div>
He has been a technocrat for his entire life, a manager in State Companies
(D.E.K.O.), a party wangler and a gravedigger of struggles. This spokesman of
P.A.S.O.K. politics within the workers' movement lives in the northern suburbs,
smokes cigars and gets a fat paycheck, from National Bank and G.S.E.E., while
administering huge state and E.U. funds.
</div>
<br />
<div>
He got promoted by his boss, while it is forbidden for trade unionists to
get a promotion during their service time -- and he accepted the
promotion.
</div>
<br />
<div>
He organized a conference for the 90 years of G.S.E.E. in the amphitheater
of National Bank, namely the amphitheater of his boss Mr. Arapoglou, with funds
from the Foreign Office, thus showing his intentions and his class
position.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Panagopoulos can go join his bosses, just as he does every day. Just as he
signs the collective agreement with the employers, giving us some of the lowest
wages in Europe.
</div>
<br />
<div>
How dare he reproach the insurgent workers, he who is the ringleader the
repression of every labor demand?
</div>
<br />
<div>
Here in the occupied G.S.E.E., there is plaque that commemorates each of
its leaders. Above the name of Panagopoulos, there are many other names of
bureaucrats who got the reward of becoming PMs: Kanellopoulos, Protopapas,
Polizogopoulos. On this plaque there are also the names of the appointed (not
elected) professional unionists during Junta and the Occupation. That's where
Panagopoulos' name deserves to be.
</div>
<br />
<div>
He can abandon us where we've been forever: at work, unemployed, in our
class position, in our night shifts, on the streets, on the insurrection during
daytime, on the street ...
</div>
<br />
<div>
If Panagopoulos worries about those who now are at work, let him stay calm.
They will turn up for the evening assembly, that will open up the building he
kept closed during all these years. They will not go to work tomorrow -- the day
he refused to call for a strike -- to hit the streets and express their
rage.
</div>
<br />
<div>
A rage Panagopoulos can't and does not want to comprehend, because that's
what his fat paycheck and his repressive role dictate ...
</div>
<br />
<div>
Here we are ...
</div>

G.S.E.E. building
</div>

<div>
<strong>Communique #3 (17 December 2008)</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div>
An answer from the liberated building of G.S.E.E.:
</div>
<br />
<div>
Panagopoulos declared this morning that we are not workers, since workers
are at work. This, among many other things, reveals what Panagopoulos' &quot;job&quot;
really is. Panagopoulos' &quot;job&quot; is to make sure that workers are at work, to do
everything within his reach to ensure that workers are at work.
</div>
<br />
<div>
But for the last ten days, workers are not only at work, they are out on
the streets. And this is a fact that Panagopoulos and every other Panagopoulos
can't hide, even if he succeeds in hiding the sun that brings light to our steps
and rage onto the streets of this city.
</div>
<br />
<div>
We are working people, we are jobless (paying in layoffs our participation
in strikes called by G.S.E.E., when they -- the trade unionists -- are rewarded
with promotions), we are working under contract moving from job to job, we work
insecurely either formally or informally in a &quot;stage&quot; progam or in subsidized
jobs to lower the unemployment index. We are part of this world and we are here.
Whoever wants to understand can understand.
</div>
<br />
<div>
We are insurgent workers, end of story.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Every single one of our revenue stamps is paid with blood, sweat, violence,
broken waists, broken hands, knees, feet, heads.
</div>
<br />
<div>
The entire world is made by us, the workers.
</div>
<br />
<div>
PS. We heard on the radio that our act was an artistic happening. We accept
this characterization, but only as far as the proletariat will abolish art and
philosophy (along with state and capital)...
