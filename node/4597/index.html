<p><strong>
By Adam W. - <em>Industrial Worker</em>, January, 2009
</strong></p>
<p>
Much
has been said in the United States labor movement around the Employee
Free Choice Act (EFCA), a bill many mainstream leaders tout as the
solution to the decline of unions. With the recent election of Barrack
Obama and the Democratic Party holding the majority of seats in both
houses of the US Congress, these same leaders have their hearts set
that their millions of dollars in campaign contributions will pay off
with the passage of the bill.
</p>
<p>
The
meat of the EFCA would amend existing labor law in the US to allow
unions to gain official recognition in a workplace through a majority
of workers signing authorization cards and avoid the perilous and
employer-dominated election route. Once a union is certified, employers
have to begin sitting down with the union within ten days. If no deal
is reached government mediators can force employers to sign a first
contract, even without the vote of workers. The EFCA also would
drastically increase the penalties companies face for violating workers
rights, such as with firing workers for organizing, which happen at
record rates in the US compared to the rest of the industrialized
world. Workers could receive up to three times the back pay owed and
companies could be fined up to $20,000 for willful or repeated
violations.
</p>
<p>
What
are members of the IWW to think of this? We are a small but growing
international union with a vision of a completely different world. Not
the vague change promised by both sides in the US presidential
elections, but a world without bosses, where everyday workers are in
the driver’s seat, and where hopes and dreams for a better world can
truly be realized. Will the passage of the EFCA move us closer to our
vision of a new world? There is certainly a great deal of hope in the
change that the EFCA could bring, but I think we need to look more
critically whether substantial change will come even if the EFCA should
pass.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Weighing the EFCA</strong>
</p>
<p>
Let’s
lead off the discussion on the positives. With the harsh reality of
unemployment, growing debt and long stagnant wages that many workers
throughout the US are currently facing, mainstream news coverage of
Congress merely debating workers rights is enough to make millions
consider the idea of a union at their workplace. This could provide an
opening in the narrow, pro-business discussion that dominates US
politics. Should it happen, members of the IWW would be wise to seize
this opportunity to talk with more workers and expand our organizing
wherever we can.
</p>
<p>
Further,
if the Act should pass in its existing form (as it could easily be
watered down) the increased penalties could provide us with greater
leverage over resistant employers. A prime example would be New
York warehouse employer Handy Fat Trading, which has fired IWW members
and defied several rulings by the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB). Both a national debate around unions and workers right and
greater enforcement of labor laws would help us in the IWW.
</p>
<p>
Now
let’s discuss why I think we should see the EFCA in a critical light.
Many labor leaders promote the bill in language that ranges from a
‘great step forward’ to a cure-all of sorts, which would usher in a new
era of unionization such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations
(CIO) organizing drives of the Thirties.
</p>
<p>
I think these views have some serious problems.
</p>
<p>
First,
I’m skeptical that it will pass and not just because Obama has
appointed a centrist cabinet of former Clinton officials. Labor’s
betrayal by Democrats and the game of “wait and see, they’ll deliver”
every time a Democratic president comes to power is a river so deep,
you may as well call it an ocean. Barring significant strikes or
actions by workers that begin to scare business elites into wanting to
offer labor a bone, I don’t see this history changing.
</p>
<p>
The
largest issue with the EFCA, though, is the use of card checks to gain
official union recognition. To join a union, a worker would sign a
membership card. If more than 50 per cent of the workers signed cards,
the employer would have to recognize the union.
</p>
<p>
While
the bill would undeniably make this process easier, I don’t think this
will lead to the huge membership increases we’re led to believe.
Canada, for instance, has similar card check recognition and enforced
arbitration laws yet it has a declining private sector union rate of
about 17 per cent, compared to eight per cent or less in the US.
Despite the laws, Canadian companies have continued to effectively use
union-busting to prevent workers from organizing and to decertify
existing unions at higher rates than new ones can be organized—exactly
the same situation as in the US.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Mainstream
labor’s embrace of this aspect of the EFCA is actually the most
troubling in my eyes because it represents the same problem that has
been plaguing mainstream unions since the passage of the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935: trading easier membership gains and labor
peace in exchange for the shop floor militancy that can actually fight
effectively to win against employers. If unions are able to gain
recognition through card check that they wouldn’t have been able to do
through fighting for voluntary recognition, this drastically increases
the likelihood that the large, centrally controlled business unions
will be meeting employers at the table with stacks of authorization
cards and passive bodies of workers, rather than the well organized
rank-and-file committees needed to win. These unions would rely on two
year, government-imposed contracts that workers will not be able to
vote down and which will bar workers from striking.
</p>
<p>
Overall,
much of mainstream labor’s framing of EFCA promotes short cuts to
rebuilding the labor movement, such as relying on government laws,
rather than the hard work of organizing and fighting the bosses that is
needed. This framing is a not an entirely subtle analogy drawn between
the EFCA and the mass organizing of industrial unions in the 1930’s
under the breakaway CIO that was allowed by the passage of the National
Labor Relations Act in 1935.
</p>
<p>
But
the analogy doesn’t hold water. The worker insurgency of the 1930s in
the US was a mass movement of workers who struck and occupied factories
largely without any leadership by unions and before the formation of
the CIO. The government reacted to this development by passing the NLRA
in 1935, whose purpose was to cool disruptive strikes through offering
workers the legal right to collectively bargain. In the next several
years, the CIO was then able to sweep the insurgents into its
membership as the wave of sit-downs peaked in 1936-37. Over the next
decade, the CIO worked to create its own “labor peace” through signing
no-strike clauses, curbing the ability of workers to deal with
grievances on the shop floor, and channeling workers’ energies into
electoral politics (for more see Frances Fox Piven and Richard
Cloward’s chapter on the CIO in Poor People’s Movements). This
background should be kept in mind any time we hear arguments that
federal laws and union officials make history and not workers
themselves.
</p>
<p>
So,
in what light should labor radicals who want to rebuild the labor
movement and create a new world, see the EFCA? First, we should not
hold our breath or hold back in any of our organizing efforts by
waiting for its passage. Second, should the EFCA pass, we should take
every effort to take advantage of the increased discussion of unions.
This may be difficult in practice as workers may approach us wanting to
organize, but under the false impression that it is suddenly “easier”
under the new check recognition. We need to stick to our guns, though,
and continue our practice of solidarity unionism, even when it involves
strategically using the card check process.
</p>
<p>
Above
all, we should remain critically cautious and skeptical around the
promises of the EFCA and even more skeptical of those in the labor
movement who promote it.
