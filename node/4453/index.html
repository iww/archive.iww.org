</p>
<p>
A peaceful union march is brutally attacked by police. A union activist’s
leg is horribly disfigured and nearly amputated. Maimed possibly for
life, she is charged with multiple felony offenses.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The
battleground is not the coalfields of Harlan County in the 1930s or
1970s; it's not an example of anti-union violence in Colombia or the
Philippines. Our setting is present day Providence, Rhode Island.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">On
that brilliant Saturday, August 11 of 2007, Alexandra Svoboda didn’t do
what she was supposed to do. She didn’t stay home and watch TV. She
didn’t go shop at her local Wal-Mart. She didn’t waste away hours on
MySpace.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">That
beautiful Saturday afternoon, Alex chose action. A twenty-two year old
worker, student, and union activist, she had heard the call for
solidarity from a group of immigrant workers organizing at a Queens,
New York sweatshop. The sweatshop, known as HWH-Dragonland Trading,
distributed restaurant supplies and maintained labor conditions
horrendous even by the abysmal standards of the sector.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Some
of the workers at the company joined the Industrial Workers of the
World (IWW), the union which Alex is a member of. The workers were fed
up with rampant abuse, stolen wages, and work weeks over 100 hours.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">When
it became known that the sweatshop sold supplies to a restaurant chain
with a location in North Providence, Alex and her fellow IWW members in
Providence knew they had to act. They were motivated not by some notion
of charity, but by a belief in solidarity and mutual aid. That is, the
concept that as workers we all benefit when we stand together no matter
our race, immigration status, gender, or sexual orientation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">As
the mostly young IWW workers marched toward Jackie’s Galaxie restaurant
to raise awareness about its relationship to the Queens sweatshop,
North Providence police officers began their attack. Inexplicably,
three police officers singled out Alex and violently dislocated her
knee as they threw her into the ground. A cop then sat on the
horrifically injured Alex and handcuffed her. Meanwhile, fellow IWW
member Jason Friedmutter was taken down, cuffed, and arrested as well.
Other peaceful marchers were pepper sprayed. (Graphic photos of the
brutal police assault are <a href="http://jonathanmcintosh.smugmug.com/gallery/3293537">available here</a>.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">After
the attack, doctors conducted an emergency surgery on Alex’s leg. Had
the surgery not succeeded, they would have proceeded with amputation
plans. Three more surgeries, unspeakable pain, and countless hours of
physical therapy followed. The police had torn the popliteal artery in
Alex’s knee, fractured her tibia and fibia, and caused meniscus as well
as ligament tears. Because of her injury, Alex hasn’t been able to work
in over a year. Her life will never be the same.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Communities
of color, low-wage workers, and other groups familiar with police
brutality know that criminal charges or innuendo against victims is the
norm following police aggression. The case of Alex and Jason is no
different. Alex was charged ridiculously but not surprisingly with
three felony counts of assaulting a police officer as well as
misdemeanor resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Jason was charged
with obstruction of justice. Though Alex’s felony charges have now been
downgraded to misdemeanors, the pair still face a criminal trial in the
upcoming months.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Confronted
with the determined resolve of Alex and her fellow unionists, Jackie’s
Galaxie ultimately cut off all ties with the HWH-Dragonland sweatshop.
HWH-Dragonland has since reportedly gone out of business. While a union
shop with quality wages and working conditions would have been a better
outcome, at least there's one less worker abusing sweatshop on Planet
Earth and one more example of the consequences of union-busting for
other sweatshops.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Alex
Svoboda joins a long line of working class heroes who have been
severely wounded or killed struggling for justice against the
capitalists and their unchecked corporate power. In Thomas Paine’s
phrase, she “dare[d] oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant.” By
engaging in direct action on behalf of her class, she aroused the ire
of the State and suffered terribly for it.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Revolutionary
change comes about through the everyday hard work and sacrifice of
people like Alex. She was out there for us that fateful day --- all of
us who have felt the sting of indignity at work and who believe that
working people deserve better.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Let’s
be there for her now. Alex and Jason need financial and moral support
to have their innocence affirmed at trial. You can e-mail
providenceiww@gmail.com for details on how to lend a hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">When
you stand firm in your life not just against exploitation, but the
exploiter-corporations themselves, I hope you’ll be strengthened and
inspired by Alex’s example. I know I am.</span>
