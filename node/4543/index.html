<strong>By Melissa Allison - <em>Seattle Times</em> business reporter, Jan. 6, 2009</strong>

<div>
</div>
<div>
Starbucks has reached a settlement in principle over a Michigan barista
whom the National Labor Relations Board said was fired in June because of his
union activities.
</div>
<br />
<div>
An administrative trial that was scheduled for today has been canceled, and
the agreement is expected to be signed this week, said Chet Byerly, resident
officer for the NLRB in Grand Rapids. He would not disclose details of the
proposed agreement.
</div>
<br />
<div>
A Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed that it is working on a
settlement.
</div>
<br />
<div>
It is the third time in a month that Starbucks has faced action from the
NLRB regarding the Industrial Workers of the World union.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Last month, an NLRB administrative law judge found that Starbucks took part
in unfair labor practices at several of its New York cafes.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Last week, the Seattle chain settled a separate NLRB dispute in
Michigan.
</div>
<br />
<div>
All three cases were initiated by baristas affiliated with the IWW, a
century-old union that has worked for several years to improve conditions for
Starbucks workers.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In New York last month, an NLRB judge ordered Starbucks to give back jobs
to three former workers and compensate them for lost earnings. The company also
must post notices informing employees of their labor-organizing
rights.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Starbucks plans to appeal the ruling, according to spokeswoman Tara
Darrow.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Such appeals often take a year and might last longer now that the NLRB's
board has lost three of its five members, said University of Tennessee law
professor Jeff Hirsch, a former attorney at the NLRB.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Last week's settlement stemmed from a complaint that barista and IWW member
Cole Dorsey made to the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration
about a leaky air conditioner.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In interviewing at least one Starbucks worker about the matter, attorneys
at a local law firm representing Starbucks neglected to issue legally required
warnings that help prevent coercive questioning.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;We contend that these warnings are not necessary when dealing with an
occupational safety charge. The NLRB disagreed,&quot; Darrow said in an e-mail. &quot;We
elected to settle the matter to avoid litigation.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
Starbucks did not admit wrongdoing but must post a notice in the affected
store in Grand Rapids &quot;saying they won't do it again,&quot; said NLRB Regional
Director Stephen Glasser.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Dorsey, the barista who complained about the air conditioner, was fired in
June after working for Starbucks almost two years. The NLRB charges that he was
dismissed because of his union activities.
</div>
<br />
<div>
He was fired eight months after Starbucks and the IWW settled an agreement
over unionizing efforts by employees at his Grand Rapids store. At that time,
Starbucks agreed to post notices in that store advising employees of their
unionizing rights.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Such settlements never come with fines and rarely with admissions of
wrongdoing. The Employee Free Choice Act, which stalled in the last session of
Congress, would allow the NLRB to order fines in some situations, according to
former NLRB attorney Hirsch. The bill faces strong opposition from the business
community.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In October, Starbucks settled a similar complaint in Minneapolis regarding
another employee who claimed he was fired for encouraging co-workers to join the
IWW.
