<p><u>Disclaimer</u> - <em>The following article is reposted here because it is an issue with some relevance to the IWW. The views of the author do not necessarily agree with those of the IWW and vice versa.</em></p><p><img border="0" align="right" src="../../graphics/agitators/modern/x351964/dhsg3.jpg" /><strong>By Chris Kutalik - June 2006</strong></p><p>During the countdown to&nbsp; Los Angeles truckers struck in solidarity with immigrants and over their own working conditions. Photo: Axel&nbsp; Koester the May Day immigrant&nbsp; walkouts, transportation industry commentators worried about the impact&nbsp; that immigrant strikes would have on the nation?s ports. Many feared&nbsp; repeats of the 2004 and 2005 strikes by mostly immigrant Latino port truckers (or troqueros), which crippled freight traffic up and down the&nbsp; West Coast. </p><p>Troqueros at the nation?s largest port complex, Los Angeles/Long Beach,&nbsp; did not disappoint. </p><p><strong>L.A. SHUT DOWN</strong> </p><p>The thousands of tons of goods that flow daily from the two combined&nbsp; ports came to a near, shuddering halt on May 1. Over 90 percent of the&nbsp; 12,000 truckers who service the port refused to come in to work, according&nbsp; to the California Trucking Association. Port terminal operators confirmed&nbsp; that 80-90 percent of truck traffic was halted for the day. </p><p>At mid-morning the next day the port was still running at only 20&nbsp; percent capacity, as drivers trickled back to work. Line haul drivers (who&nbsp; shuttle freight containers over longer routes between ports and rail&nbsp; yards) are also believed to have refused work that day throughout Southern&nbsp; California, further congesting traffic throughout the system. </p><p>Drivers as far away as Las Vegas and Phoenix were also reported to have refused containers along the overland freight corridor to the L.A./Long&nbsp; Beach port, as part of the shutdown. </p><p>&quot;The work stoppage flowed down the line,&quot; said Ernesto Nevarez, an organizer who has worked with California port truckers for 20 years. ?It&nbsp; didn?t stop because the harbor simply shut down &quot;it was caused by truckers,&nbsp; by labor. They made it happen with their own organizing.&quot; While rising fuel costs--a major cause of previous walkouts--are once&nbsp; again pushing drivers to action, troqueros have other concerns. Troqueros&nbsp; shoulder most of their own fuel, insurance, maintenance, and truck finance&nbsp; payments, while making an average wage of only $11.33 per hour from&nbsp; shippers and other contractors. </p><p>&quot;It isn't just about the price of diesel fuel?troqueros haven't seen&nbsp; cost of living increases since their strike in 1993,&quot; said Nevarez. &quot;Many&nbsp; are working double shifts or a shift and a half to make up the&nbsp; difference.&quot;</p><p><strong>ANGER OVER RAIDS</strong> </p><p>Though they are non-union, port truckers' location at a vulnerable&nbsp; point in the over-stretched freight distribution network gives them&nbsp; tremendous power. On May 1, this shop floor power turned into an&nbsp; expression of anger at their own work conditions and solidarity with the&nbsp; immigrant rights movement. Indeed, although many troqueros in the Los Angeles area have work visas&nbsp; or have been naturalized, some of the impetus for the action came from a&nbsp; familiar source of anger for many immigrant workers--aggressive raids by&nbsp; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>Two weeks before May 1, a line of 50 trucks was held up during one such raid. A number of drivers lacking full documentation on their person at&nbsp; the time were pulled out of their cabs and their trucks were towed&nbsp; away. &quot;Anger exploded over the raid,&quot; said Nevarez. &quot;Before all this we were expecting at best a 30 percent shutdown of the harbor.&quot; </p><p>More port actions are expected during the summer as gas prices--and&nbsp; troqueros' &nbsp;frustrations--continue to rise. </p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_273 first"><a href="../../category/campaigns/current-campaigns/freight-truckers/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for the Freight Truckers campaign.
