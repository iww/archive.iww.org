Companies are finding even more ways to screen job applicants — by
checking club discussion boards. Starbucks Corp., the nation’s leading
coffee retailer, is under scrutiny after a series of e-mails revealed
the company’s anti-union practices. The pinnacle of the events in
question came when Starbucks managers read through the discussion
boards on Cornell Organization for Labor Action’s website in order to
identify job applicants and current employees that were labor
activists.
</p>
<p>
In a series of e-mails uncovered by The Wall Street Journal,
Starbucks managers pulled names from the discussion board and then
cross-referenced them with an employee database. They found that three
employees were members of the University’s School of Industrial and
Labor Relations and active union supporters, and asked executives if
they could inform local managers of the workers’ identities.
</p>
<p>
Daniel Gross, an organizer for the SWU and a former Starbucks
barista, testified that Jim McDermott, a Starbucks executive, admitted
on the witness stand in a pending NLRB case that he had approved of
these activities.
</p>
<p>
The company has already singled out three graduates of the
University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations as union
activists — Tomer Malchi ’03, Peter Montalbano, and Sarah Bender. All
three worked as baristas and are members of the Starbucks Workers
Union, SWU, which is a part of the Industrial Workers of the World.
</p>
<p>
The SWU has been trying to organize Starbucks baristas since 2004.
The movement stems from some workers’ claims that Starbucks does not
treat its employees in a fair manner by paying low wages and not
providing enough hours to work. These two factors can make it very
difficult for someone to support themselves, according to the Starbucks
Union website.
</p>
<p>
Because the content on the discussion board is public information,
it is not illegal for managers to read through it. However, some
consider it a questionable practice to use the information against
current or prospective employees — similar to an employer’s use of a
person’s Facebook profile or MySpace account to find information that
could be used against them.
</p>
<p>
According to Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education
research, Starbucks was not looking to single out students and
graduates of the ILR school, instead they were aiming to target
individuals who were known labor activists and pro-union workers.
</p>
<p>
Bronfenbrenner said, “Cornell sends more students into the labor
movement than any other university in the country and corporate America
is aware of this.”
</p>
<p>
Currently, the IWW has taken Starbucks to court in New York arguing
that the corporation has committed at least 38 labor violations during
2005-2006. The National Labor Relations Board found that there was
enough evidence to support these allegations and has passed the case
onto to an administrative law judge, who will determine if there is
enough evidence to support these charges.
</p>
<p>
Gross claims he was fired because of his union activity, which is a subject of the pending NLRB case.
</p>
<p>
“This case is important because it tells about the reality of
employment at Starbucks. Starbucks has tricked people into thinking it
is a better place to work, but the trial has shown just like Wal-mart,
Starbucks will go to great lengths to coerce and restrain workers’
right to organize,” Gross said.
</p>
<p>
Starbucks maintains that it complies with all labors laws in New
York state and recognizes workers’ rights to organize. Forbes Magazine
ranked Starbucks as the number two “best company to work for” in the
large company category. It claims that the average hourly worker nets
$35,294 a year.
</p>
<p>
The e-mails are part of an exhibit in the case that exemplifies
Starbucks’ anti-union stance by denying workers the right to engage in
concerted activity and discuss working conditions on the premise. Gross
said the union-busting mentality stems directly from the top with
Chairman Howard Schultz.
</p>
<p>
“A company-wide message was sent out within days of our announcement
that we were going to try to organize the workers saying [Schulz] was
disappointed with the union. The union busting started immediately at
this point,” Gross said.
</p>
<p>
However, even if Starbucks is found guilty, Bronfenbrenner
speculates it will receive no more than a slap on the wrist. As
punishment for its action, it would merely have to hang a poster on the
wall stating that it will not terminate or discriminate against union
supporters. Starbucks would have to reinstate the worker and pay any
lost wages that accrued during the case minus any wages the worker made
in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the problem with American labor law… if a worker gets fired
for union activity he is not going to want to go back to that
employer,” Bronfenbrenner said.
</p>
<p>
In light of these revealed e-mails, COLA has been forced to modify
how they distribute information through online channels in order to
protect their members from being discriminated against.
</p>
<p>
“We are disgusted by the fact corporations read our e-mails to
screen out applicants. The reading of the e-mails itself is not
illegal, so there is not a lot we can do but we have switched to a
private list serve for specific campaigns like the one against
Starbucks right now. Fil Eden ’10, president of COLA, said. “Because we
are so integrated with our alumni network and it helps people who don’t
go to the meetings . . . It’s difficult to keep [names] anonymous on
the listserv . . . we know have to be careful about what we write.”
</p>
<p>
The last time Starbucks executives came to campus was more than a
year ago to recruit ILR graduates for positions in the human resources
department of the corporation.
</p>
<p>
This is not the first time the University has allowed an
organization facing labor law violations to recruit on campus. In 2003,
Cornell came under fire for violating the Open Hearts, Open Mind policy
by allowing the uniform manufacturer Cintas to recruit at on-campus
career fair after they had purposefully screened out applicants who
were labor activists. But due to pressure from students in COLA and
Students Against Sweatshops, University did not permit Cintas to
recruit at any more events.
</p>
<p>
“Employers do not want a unionized setting because it takes away
some of their control. Unionized workers make more money and have more
control of their schedules, while also providing a way for workers to
ensure there is just cause for discipline. They gain stability and
morale,” Bronfenbrenner said. “It’s an issue of what kind of country do
we have.”
