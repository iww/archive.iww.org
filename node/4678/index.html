<p><img src="../../graphics/portraits/Franklin%20Rosemont/franklin.jpg" align="right" /><b>
Franklin Rosemont, celebrated poet, artist, historian, street speaker,
and surrealist activist, died Sunday, April 12 in Chicago.
</b></p>
<p>
He was 65 years old. With his partner and comrade, Penelope Rosemont, and lifelong friend Paul Garon, he co-founded the <span class="ext">Chicago Surrealist Group</span>,
an enduring and adventuresome collection of characters that would make
the city a center for the reemergence of that movement of artistic and
political revolt. Over the course of the following four decades,
Franklin and his Chicago comrades produced a body of work, of
declarations, manifestos, poetry, collage, hidden histories, and other
interventions that has, without doubt, inspired an entirely new
generation of revolution in the service of the marvelous.
</p>
<p>
Franklin Rosemont was born in Chicago on October 2, 1943 to two of
the area’s more significant rank-and-file labor activists, the printer
Henry Rosemont and the jazz musician Sally Rosemont. Dropping out of
Maywood schools after his third year of high school (and instead
spending countless hours in the Art Institute of Chicago’s library
learning about surrealism), he managed nonetheless to enter Roosevelt
University in 1962. Already radicalized through family tradition, and
his own investigation of political comics, the Freedom Rides, and the
Cuban Revolution, Franklin was immediately drawn into the stormy
student movement at Roosevelt.
</p>
<p>
Looking back on those days, Franklin would tell anyone who asked
that he had “majored in St. Clair Drake” at Roosevelt. Under the
mentorship of the great African American scholar, he began to explore
much wider worlds of the urban experience, of racial politics, and of
historical scholarship—all concerns that would remain central for him
throughout the rest of his life. He also continued his investigations
into surrealism, and soon, with Penelope, he traveled to Paris in the
winter of 1965 where he found André Breton and the remaining members of
the Paris Surrealist Group. The Parisians were just as taken with the
young Americans as Franklin and Penelope were with them, as it turned
out, and their encounter that summer was a turning point in the lives
of both Rosemonts. With the support of the Paris group, they returned
to the United States later that year and founded America’s first and
most enduring indigenous surrealist group, characterized by close study
and passionate activity and dedicated equally to artistic production
and political organizing. When Breton died in 1966, Franklin worked
with his wife, Elisa, to put together the first collection of André’s
writings in English.
</p>
<p>
Active in the 1960s with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW),
the Rebel Worker group, the Solidarity Bookshop and Students for a
Democratic Society, Franklin helped to lead an IWW strike of blueberry
pickers in Michigan in 1964, and put his considerable talents as a
propagandist and pamphleteer to work producing posters, flyers,
newspapers, and broadsheets on the SDS printing press. A long and
fruitful collaboration with Paul Buhle began in 1970 with a special
surrealist issue of Radical America. Lavish, funny, and barbed issues
of Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion and special issues of Cultural
Correspondence were to follow.
</p>
<p>
The smashing success of the 1968 World Surrealist Exhibition at
Gallery Bugs Bunny in Chicago announced the ability of the American
group to make a huge cultural impact without ceasing to be critics of
the frozen mainstreams of art and politics. The Rosemonts soon became
leading figures in the reorganization of the nation’s oldest labor
press, <span class="ext">Charles H. Kerr Company</span>.
Under the mantle of the Kerr Company and its surrealist imprint Black
Swan Editions, Franklin edited and printed the work of some of the most
important figures in the development of the political left: C.L.R.
James, Marty Glaberman, Benjamin Péret and Jacques Vaché, T-Bone Slim,
Mother Jones, Lucy Parsons, and, in a new book released just days
before Franklin’s death, Carl Sandburg. In later years, he created and
edited the Surrealist Histories series at the University of Texas
Press, in addition to continuing his work with Kerr Co. and Black Swan.
</p>
<p>
A friend and valued colleague of such figures as Studs Terkel, Mary
Low, the poets Philip Lamantia, Diane di Prima, Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
and Dennis Brutus, the painter Lenora Carrington, and the historians
Paul Buhle, David Roediger, John Bracey, and Robin D.G. Kelley,
Rosemont’s own artistic and creative work was almost impossibly varied
in inspirations and results. Without ever holding a university post, he
wrote or edited more than a score of books while acting as a great
resource for a host of other writers.
</p>
<p>
He became perhaps the most productive scholar of labor and the left
in the United States. His spectacular study, Joe Hill: The I.W.W. and
the Making of a Revolutionary Workingclass Counterculture, began as a
slim projected volume of that revolutionary martyr’s rediscovered
cartoons and grew to giant volume providing our best guide to what the
early twentieth century radical movement was like and what radical
history might do. His coedited volume Haymarket Scrapbook stands as the
most beautifully illustrated labor history publication of the recent
past. Indispensable compendiums like The Big Red Songbook, What is
Surrealism?, Menagerie in Revolt, and the forthcoming Black Surrealism
are there to ensure that the legacy of the movements that inspired him
continue to inspire young radicals for generations to come. In none of
this did Rosemont separate scholarship from art, or art from revolt.
His books of poetry include Morning of the Machine Gun, Lamps Hurled at
the Stunning Algebra of Ants, The Apple of the Automatic Zebra’s Eye
and Penelope. His marvelous fierce, whimsical and funny artwork—to
which he contributed a new piece every day—graced countless surrealist
publications and exhibitions.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, between the history he himself helped create and the
history he helped uncover, Franklin was never without a story to tell
or a book to write—about the IWW, SDS, Hobohemia in Chicago, the Rebel
Worker, about the past 100 years or so of radical publishing in the US,
or about the international network of Surrealists who seemed to always
be passing through the Rosemonts’ Rogers Park home. As engaged with and
excited by new surrealist and radical endeavors as he was with
historical ones, Franklin was always at work responding to queries from
a new generation of radicals and surrealists, and was a generous and
rigorous interlocutor. In every new project, every revolt against
misery, with which he came into contact, Franklin recognized the
glimmers of the free and unfettered imagination, and lent his own
boundless creativity to each and every struggle around him, inspiring,
sustaining, and teaching the next generation of surrealists worldwide.
