<p>
Jul.
22--Some baristas at the Mall of America Starbucks are using the
company's recently announced plans to close 600 stores nationwide to
publicize a 4-year-old union organizing effort.
</p>
<p>
Starbucks plans to close 27 Minnesota locations.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, two workers walked off the cafe floor and delivered a demand
letter to the store manager asking for, among other things, a more
lucrative severance package for workers in Minnesota affected by the
store closings, according to the Starbucks Workers Union, an organizing
campaign of the Industrial Workers of the World.
</p>
<p>
Jake Bell,
one of the workers involved, said they returned to work after faxing
the letter to the Seattle-based chain's local offices in Bloomington.
The Mall of America store is not among those the chain plans to close.
</p>
<p>
Starbucks did not return a phone call and an e-mail requesting comment.
</p>
<p>
Erik Forman, a former Starbucks worker who is helping with the effort,
would not reveal how many workers at the mall store were supporters.
The union claims to have 200 current and former Starbucks employees as
members. The chain said in regulatory filings that it employed 144,000
workers in the U.S. and 172,000 worldwide as of last fall.
</p>
<p>
&quot;We went public with our union and basically told management that we
are forming a union and gave them a list of demands,&quot; said Bell, who
has worked at Starbucks for a year and a half and makes $8.37 per hour.
He and others started wearing union pins at work.
</p>
<p>
Since the launch of the IWW campaign at Starbucks in 2004, the company has been cited
multiple times by the National Labor Relations Board for trying to stop
union organizing activity, according to press reports. Forman claims he
was fired for union activities and has filed a charge with the NLRB.
&quot;You can discuss baseball at work,&quot; he said. &quot;You should be able to
discuss the union.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The IWW, which was at its peak in the 1920s,
is viewed by many as among the most radical of union organizations. At
times, it has rejected approaches to labor-management relations
championed by more mainstream unions.
</p>
<p>
The Starbucks Workers
Union essentially is a group of workers who are critical of Starbucks
and are trying to organize nationally in a store-by-store effort. It
has been particularly active in New York, Chicago and Grand Rapids,
Mich.
</p>
<p>
The union's core demands are fair severance, better
wages, an automatic annual cost of living increase, guaranteed minimum
hours and more staff members on shifts. According to Forman, the union
isn't seeking an election or a bargaining unit contract. Instead
members are relying on &quot;solidarity unionism&quot; to advance their cause.
</p>
<p>
That might not serve them as well as representation by a more influential union, one labor expert said.
</p>
<p>
&quot;The
workers at Starbucks would be better served by a strong institutional
union like the union that represents hotel and restaurant workers,
which is Unite Here,&quot; said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor studies
at Cornell University.
</p>
<p>
If that were the case, they'd have the
legal power and a strategic perspective to develop strong contracts
with Starbucks that would protect them.
</p>
<p>
&quot;However, Unite Here
has shown no interest in organizing these workers,&quot; Hurd said. &quot;For now
it may be that the best way for these workers to voice their complaints
is through the Starbucks Workers Union campaign.&quot;
