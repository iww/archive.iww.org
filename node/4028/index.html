<strong>
By David Rovics - <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/rovics03252008.html" target="_blank">Originally published at <em>Counterpunch</em></a></strong><br />
<br />
Last weekend I sang at an antiwar protest
in downtown Portland, Oregon, on the fifth anniversary of the
ongoing slaughter in Iraq. In both its good and bad aspects,
the event downtown was not unusual. Hard-working, unpaid activists
from various organizations and networks put in long hours organizing,
doing publicity, and sitting through lots of contentious meetings
in the weeks and months leading up to the event. On the day of
the event, different groups set up tents to network with the
public and talk about matters of life and death. There was a
stage with talented musicians of various musical genres performing
throughout the day, and a rally with speakers in the afternoon,
followed by a march. Attendance was pathetically low. In large
part I'm sure this was due to the general sense of discouragement
most people in the US seem to feel about our ability to effect
change under the Bush regime. It was raining especially hard
by west coast standards, and that also didn't help.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">The crowd grew to it's peak
size during the rally and march, but was almost nonexistent before
the 2 pm rally. There was only a trickle of people visiting the
various tents prior to the rally, and the musicians on the stage
were playing to a largely nonexistent audience. The musical program,
scheduled to happen from 10 am to 6 pm, was being billed as the
World War None Festival. The term &quot;festival&quot; was contentious,
however, and Pdx Peace, the local peace coalition responsible
for the rally, couldn't come to consensus on using the term &quot;festival.&quot;
In their publicity they referred to the festival as an &quot;action
camp.&quot; The vast majority of people have no idea what an
&quot;action camp&quot; is, including me, and I've been actively
involved in the progressive movement for my entire adult life.
The local media, of course, also had no idea what an &quot;action
camp&quot; was, and any publicity that could have been hoped
for from them did not happen. Word did not spread about the event
to any significant degree, at least in part because people didn't
know what they were supposed to be spreading the word about.
Everybody from all political, social, class and ethnic backgrounds
knows what a festival is, but certain elements within Pdx Peace
didn't want to use the term to describe what was quite obviously
meant to be a festival (as well as a rally and march). Anybody
above the age of three can tell you that when you have live music
on a stage outdoors all day, that's called a festival. But not
Pdx Peace.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Why? I wasn't at the meetings
-- thankfully, I'm just a professional performer, not an organizer
of anything other than my own concert tours, so I only know second-hand
about what was said. There's no need to name the names of individuals
or the smaller groups involved with the coalition in this case
-- the patterns are so common and so well-established that the
names just don't matter. Some people within the peace coalition
were of the opinion that the war in Iraq was too serious a matter
to have a festival connected to it. Because, I imagine, of some
combination of factors including the nature of consensus decision-making,
sectarianism on the part of a few, and muddled thinking on the
part of some others, those who thought that a festival should
happen -- and should be called a festival -- were overruled.
My hat goes off to the World War None Festival organizers (a
largely separate entity from Pdx Peace), and to those within
Pdx Peace who tried and failed to call the festival what it was,
and to organize a well-attended event.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">As to those who succeeded in
sabotaging the event, I ask, why is so much of the left in the
US so attached to being so dreadfully boring? Why do so many
people on the left apparently have no appreciation for the power
and importance of culture? And when organizers, progressive media
and others on the left do acknowledge culture, why is it usually
kept on the sidelines? What are we trying to accomplish here?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">It wasn't always this way.
Going back a hundred years, before we had a significant middle
class in this country, before we had a Social Security system,
Worker's Compensation, Medicare, or anything approximating the
actual (not just on paper) right to free speech, when most of
the working class majority in this country were living in utter
destitution and generally working (when they could find work)
in extremely dangerous conditions for extremely long hours, often
in jobs that required them to be itinerant, required them to
forego the pleasure of having families that they might have a
chance to see now and then, out of these conditions the Industrial
Workers of the World was born.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">The IWW at that time was a
huge, militant union that could bring industrial production in
the US to a halt, and on various regional levels, quite regularly
did. It was a multi-ethnic union led by women and men of a wide
variety of backgrounds, from all over the world. It's most well-known
member to this day was a singer-songwriter named Joe Hill, and
he was only one of many of the musician-organizers that constituted
both the leadership and membership of the IWW. While starving,
striking, or being attacked by police on the streets of Seattle,
Boston and everywhere in between, the IWW sang. Their publications
were filled with poems, lyrics and cartoons. Everybody knew the
songs and sung them daily. Some of the songs were instructive,
meant to educate workers in effective organizing techniques.
Others were battle cries of resistance, and still others celebrated
victories or lamented defeats. Their cause was nothing short
of the physical survival and spiritual dignity of the working
class. They put their bodies on the line and were often killed
and maimed for it, but they transformed this society profoundly,
and they sang the whole way through. Was their cause serious?
As serious as serious can get. And to this day, multitudes around
the world remember the songs of Joe Hill, Ralph Chaplin, and
T-Bone Slim, long after their speeches and pamphlets have been
forgotten. Like many other singer-songwriters throughout the
history of the class war, Joe Hill was executed by a firing squad
in 1916. Why? Exactly because he was so serious -- a serious
threat to the robber barons who ruled this country.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">A very different, much more
rigidly ideological organization that rose to prominence during
the declining years of the IWW was the Communist Party. This
is an organization whose early years are within the living memory
of close friends of mine, such as my dear friend Bob Steck, who
died last year at the age of 95, and spent most of his life fighting
for humanity. I spent hundreds of hours over the course of many
years interrogating Bob about his life and times (at least ten
hours of which are recorded for posterity on cassettes somewhere).
The Communist Party was very different from the IWW in many ways,
but in it's heyday it was also a huge, grassroots movement, whose
leadership and membership took many cards from the IWW's deck,
including their emphasis on the vital importance of culture.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">When Bob talked about the CP's
orientation with regards to organizing the revolution in the
USA, he said there were three primary components: the unions,
the streets, and the theater. Fighting for the welfare of the
working class by organizing for the eight-hour day and decent
wages (largely through the communist-led Congress of Industrial
Organizations, the CIO), organizing the starving millions in
the streets into the unions of the unemployed, and -- just as
importantly -- fighting for the hearts and minds of the people
through music, theater, and art. Among the musical vanguard of
the communist movement of the 1930's were people who are still
household names today for millions of people in the US and around
the world -- Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Paul Robeson, to name
a few. Traveling theater companies brought the work of Clifford
Odetts and Bertoldt Brecht to the people, educating and inspiring
militant action throughout the US. I remember Bob describing
the audience reaction to one of the early performances of<em>
Waiting for Lefty</em> in New York City, the gasps of excitement
and possibility in the packed theater when the actors on stage
shouted those last lines of the play -- &quot;Strike! Strike!
Strike!&quot; Ten curtain calls later, everyone in the theater
was ready to take to the streets, and did.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Bob and his comrades organized
and sang in New York, just as they sang going into battle in
Spain in the first fight against fascism, the one in which the
US was on the side of the fascists. Nothing unusual about that
-- soldiers on every side in every war sing as they go into battle,
whether the cause is just or unjust. They and their leadership,
whether fascist or democrat, socialist or anarchist, know that
the songs are just as powerful as the guns (regardless of what
Tom Lehrer said). You can't fire if you're running away, and
if you want to stand and fight you have to sing. Talk to anybody
involved with the Civil Rights movement and they'll tell you,
if we weren't singing, we surely would have lost heart and ran
in the face of those hate-filled, racist police and their dogs,
guns, and water cannon. Talk to anyone who lived through the
60's -- who remembers any but the most eloquent of the speeches
by the likes of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, or Mario Savio?
But millions remember the songs. Bob Dylan, Buffy Sainte-Marie,
James Brown, Aretha Franklin were the soundtrack to the struggle.
Open any magazine or newspaper in this country to this day and
you will find somewhere in the pages an unaccredited reference
to a line in a Bob Dylan song. (Try it, it's fun.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Around the world it's the same.
Dedicated leftists may sit through the speeches of Fidel Castro
or Hugo Chavez, but transcendent poetry of Pablo Neruda and the
enchanting melodies of Silvio Rodriguez cross all political and
class lines. You will have to try hard to find a Spanish-speaking
person anywhere in the Americas who does not love the work of
that Cuban communist, Silvio. You'll have to search hard to find
a Latino who does not have a warm place in their heart for that
murdered Chilean singer-songwriter, Victor Jara.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Talk to any Arab of any background,
no matter how despondent they may be about the state of the Arab
world, try to find one whose eyes do not light up when you merely
mention the names Mahmoud Darwish, Marcel Khalife, Feyrouz, Um
Khultum. Try to find anyone in Ireland but the most die-hard
Loyalist who doesn't tear up when listening to the music of Christy
Moore, whatever they think of the IRA. And ask progressives on
the streets of the US today how they came to hold their political
views that led them to take the actions they are now taking,
and as often as not you will hear answers like, &quot;I discovered
punk rock, the Clash changed my life,&quot; or &quot;I went to
a concert of Public Enemy, and that was it.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Music -- and art, poetry, theater
-- is powerful (if it's good). The powers that be know this well.
Joe Hill and Victor Jara are only a small fraction of the musicians
killed by the ruling classes for doing what they do. By the same
token, those who run this country (and so many other countries)
know the power of music and art to serve their purposes -- virtually
every product on the shelf in every store in the US has a jingle
to go along with it, and often brilliant artistic imagery to
go along with the jingle, shouting at us from every billboard
and TV commercial. (The ranks of Madison Avenue are filled with
brilliant minds who would rather be doing something more fulfilling
with their creative energy.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Enter 2008. Knowing the essential
power of music, the very industry that sells us music mass-produced
in Nashville and LA has done their best to kill music. For decades,
the few multi-billion-dollar corporations that control the music
business and the commercial airwaves have done their best to
teach us all that music is something to have in the background
to comfort you as you try to get through another mind-numbing
day of meaningless labor in some office building or department
store. It's something to help you seduce someone perhaps, or
to help you get over a breakup. It is not something to inspire
thought, action, or feelings of compassion for humanity (other
than for your girlfriend or boyfriend).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">There are always exceptions
to prove the rule, but by and large, the writers and performers
in Nashville and LA know what they're being paid to do, and what
they're being paid not to do -- if it ever occurred to them to
do anything else in the first place. But even more potently,
all those millions of musicians aspiring to become stars, or
at least to make a living at their craft, know either consciously
or implicitly that any hope of success rides on imitating the
garbage that comes out of these music factories. Of course, there
are the many others who write and sing songs (and create art,
plays, screenplays, etc.) out of a need to express themselves
or even out of a desire to make a difference in the world, but
they are systematically kept off of the airwaves, out of the
record deals, relegated largely to the internet, very lucky if
they might manage to make a living at their craft. Fundamentally,
though, they are made to feel marginal, and are looked at by
much of society as marginal, novelties, exotic. Although they
are actually the mainstream of the (non-classical) musical tradition
in the US and around the world, although the kind of music they
create has been and is still loved by billions around the world
for centuries, in the current climate, especially in present-day
US society, they are a marginal few.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">And no matter how enlightened
we would like to think we are, the progressive movement is part
of this society, for good and for ill. Most of us have swallowed
this shallow understanding of what music is. The evidence is
overwhelming. There are, of course, exceptions. Folks like the
organizers of the annual protests outside the gates of Fort Benning,
Georgia -- School of the Americas Watch -- are well aware of
the potency of culture, and use music and art to great effect,
inspiring and educating tens of thousands of participants every
November.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">On the other end of the spectrum
are the ideologically-driven people who have turned hatred of
culture into a sort of art. I have to smile when I think of the
small minority of Islamist wackos who tried to storm the stage
at one rally I sang at in DC in 2002, shouting, &quot;No music!
No music!&quot; Security for the stage was being provided by
the Nation of Islam, who faced off with this group of Islamists,
who ultimately decided that throwing down with the Jewels of
Islam behind the stage that day wasn't in their best interests,
apparently.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">But much more prevalent, and
therefore much scarier, are groups like the ANSWER &quot;Coalition.&quot;
(I put &quot;coalition&quot; in quotes because I have yet to
meet a member of a group that theoretically makes up the &quot;coalition&quot;
that has had any say in what goes on at their rallies, although
the leadership of ANSWER is of course happy to receive the bus-loads
of people that their &quot;coalition&quot; members bring to their
rallies, which seems to be the only thing that makes ANSWER a
&quot;coalition.&quot;) ANSWER, last I heard, is run by the ultra-left
sectarian group known as the Worker's World Party, which I strongly
suspect is working for the FBI. (Although as Ward Churchill says,
you don't need to be a cop to do a cop's job.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Millions of people in the US
who regularly go to antiwar protests are unaware of who is organizing
them. They just want to go to an antiwar protest. ANSWER has
become almost synonymous with &quot;antiwar protest,&quot; to
the extent that many people on the periphery of the left (such
as most people who go to their protests) refer to antiwar protests
as &quot;ANSWER protests,&quot; as in &quot;I went to an ANSWER
protest,&quot; whether or not the protest was actually organized
by ANSWER. (Just as many people say &quot;I was listening to
NPR&quot; when they were actually listening to a community radio
station that has nothing to do with NPR, broadcasting programs
such as<em> Democracy Now!,</em> which the vast majority of NPR
stations still will not touch with a ten foot pole.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">I always find it unnerving
and intriguing that ANSWER protests always seem to be mentioned
on NPR and broadcast on CSPAN, whereas rallies organized by the
bigger and actual coalition, United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ),
almost never manage to make it onto CSPAN or get covered by the
corporate media. ANSWER always seems to get the permits, whereas
UFPJ seems to be systematically denied them. Anyway, I digress
(a little). I tend to avoid anything having to do with ANSWER
or the little-known, shadowy Worker's World Party, but a few
years ago I was driving across Tennessee listening to CSPAN on
my satellite radio, and they broadcast the full four hours of
an ANSWER protest in DC. I sat through it because I wanted to
hear it from beginning to end, for research purposes, and Tennessee
is a long state to drive through from west to east, had to do
something during that drive. There was one song in the four-hour
rally. Although I've been an active member of the left for twenty
years, I recognized almost none of the names of the people who
spoke at the rally. Every speech was full of boring, tired rhetoric,
as if they were out of a screenplay written by a rightwing screenwriter
who was trying to make a mockery out of leftwing political rallies.
Judging from the names of the organizations involved, very few
of which I recognized either, they were mostly tiny little Worker's
World Party front groups. And since the Worker's World Party
apparently doesn't have any musicians in their pocket, there
was no music to speak of. (Or, quite probably I suspect, they
don't want music at their rallies because they don't want their
rallies to be interesting.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">ANSWER is an extreme example,
but a big one that most progressives are unfortunately familiar
with, whether they know who ANSWER (or Worker's World) is or
not. Inevitably, most people leave ANSWER protests feeling vaguely
used and demoralized -- aside from those who manage to stay far
enough away from the towers of speakers so they can avoid hearing
all the mindless rhetoric pouring out of them. Contrast the mood
with the protests at the gates of Fort Benning, where most people
leave feeling hopeful and inspired.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">I know I have no more hope
of influencing the leadership of Worker's World with this essay
than I have of influencing the behavior of the New York City
police department with it. But neither of these organizations
are my target audience. Those who I hope to reach are those who
are genuinely trying to create rallies and other events in the
hopes of influencing and inspiring public opinion, in the hopes
of inspiring people to action, in the hopes of winning allies
among the apolitical or even among conservatives. The people
I hope to reach are those who have been unwittingly influenced
by the corporate music industry's implicit definition of what
music and culture is and is not.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">And, here we go, I would count
among this group most of the hard-working, loving and compassionate
people who are organizing rallies, who are organizing actions,
who are organizing unions, and who are creating progressive media
on the radio, on community television and on the internet in
the US today.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">I'd like to pause for a moment
to make a disclosure. I am a professional politically-oriented
musician, what the corporate media (and many progressives) would
call a &quot;protest singer,&quot; though I reject the term.
I'm not sure what, if anything, I have to gain personally by
publishing these thoughts, but I think it behooves me to point
out that I am one of the lucky ones who has performed at rallies
and in progressive and mainstream media for hundreds of thousands
of people on a fairly regular basis throughout the world, and
I would like to hope that my words here will not be understood
as Rovics whining that he's not famous enough. I speak here for
culture generally, not for myself as an individual singer-songwriter.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">My desire is to reach groups
like Pdx Peace and their sister organizations throughout the
country. These are genuinely democratic groups, real coalitions
made up of real people, not sectarian, unaccountable groups like
ANSWER. These are groups, in short, made up of my friends and
comrades, but these are groups also made up of people who grew
up in this society and therefore generally have a lot to learn
about the power of culture to educate and inspire people. It
is not good enough to have music on the stage as people are gathering
to rally and as they are leaving to march. It's not good enough
to have a song or two sandwiched in between another half hour
of speeches -- no matter how many organizations want to have
speakers representing them on stage, or whatever other very legitimate
excuses organizers have for making their events, once again,
long and boring (even if they're not as long or as boring as
an ANSWER rally). It is not good enough for wonderful, influential
radio/TV shows like<em> Democracy Now!</em> to have snippets of
songs in between their interviews, when only two or three of
those interviews each year are related to culture. It is a sorry
state of affairs that NPR news shows do a better job of covering
pop culture than Pacifica shows do in terms of covering leftwing
culture.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">The vast majority of the contemporary,
very talented, dedicated musicians represented by, say, the &quot;links&quot;
page on &lt;http://www.davidrovics.com&gt;www.davidrovics.com,
have rarely or never been invited to sing at a local or national
protest rally (even if some few of us have, many times). The
vast majority of progressive conferences do not even include
a concert, or if they do, it's background music during dinner
on Saturday night. I can count on one hand the number of times
I have heard<em> Democracy Now!</em> or<em> Free Speech Radio News</em>
mention that a great leftwing artist is doing a tour of the US.
The number of fantastic musicians out there who have even been
played during the station breaks on<em> Democracy Now!</em> is
a tiny fraction of those that are out there -- of the dozens
of musicians featured on my &quot;links&quot; page for example,
only a small handful have even been played once. It is shameful
that it's easier to get a national, mainstream radio show in
the UK or Canada to plug a tour of such a musician than it is
to get any national Pacifica program to do this.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Radical culture needs to be
fostered and promoted, front and center, not sidelined as people
are gathering, or when the radio stations are doing station ID's.
Because if the point is to inspire people to action, a song is
worth a hundred speeches. If the point is to educate people,
a three-minute ballad is easily equal to any book. (They'll read
the book after they hear the song, not the other way around.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">It is often said that we are
in a battle for the hearts and minds of the people of this country.
It is us versus CNN, NPR, Bush, Clinton, etc. In this battle,
style matters, not just content. In this battle, it is absolutely
imperative that we remember that it is not only the minds we
need to win, but the hearts. At least in terms of the various
forms of human communication, there is nothing on Earth more
effective in winning hearts than music and art. We ignore or
sideline music and art at our peril. It's time to listen to the
music.</span>
