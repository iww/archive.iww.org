<p><em>The following is not an IWW campaign.&nbsp; It is posted in solidarity.&nbsp; An injury to one is an injury to all!&nbsp;</em></p><p>A few weeks ago the entire crew (including the captain and officers)&nbsp; of the Hawaiian Chieftain (a historic &quot;tall ship&quot;) were fired.</p> <p>The ship was grossly understaffed, lacking several licenced crew and&nbsp; an education coordinator.&nbsp; The ship's income relies on providing&nbsp; educational sail training programs to paying customers. The crew who&nbsp; were present were expected to perform multiple duties outside of their&nbsp; stated job descriptions. They were overworked and underpaid.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were also expected to sail with a group of new inexperienced paying&nbsp; trainees.&nbsp; This was felt to be unsafe because the ship did not have&nbsp; the necessary compliment of experienced crew.</p> <p>Last weekend the captain decided to stand the crew down from their&nbsp; educational sails to focus on making necessary repairs and training&nbsp; the new (paying) crew.</p> <p>The office/seaport did not support this action and chose to fire the&nbsp; captain and the crew for insubordination. The captain was the first to&nbsp; be fired, followed by officers and remaining crew.</p> <p>Included is the letter and demands that they crew delivered to the Seaport.</p> <p>Please take some time to write a letter or make a phone call in&nbsp; support of the crew of the Hawaiian Chieftain.</p> <p>Gray's Harbor Historical Seaport Authority (Hawaiian Chieftain and Lady Washington) Phone: 1-800-200-5239 Fax: 360-533-9384</p> <p>Executive Director Les Bolton les@historicalseaport.org</p> <p>Volunteer Crew Coordinator/ Vessel Operations Manager Inez Wall inez@historicalseaport.org</p> <p>*********************************************</p> <p>Hello All,</p> <p>We, the core crew of the Hawaiian Chieftain, are writing to inform you&nbsp; that we wholeheartedly support Captain Michael Kellick's decision to&nbsp; stand down the boat from education and purser duties from May&nbsp; 9th-12th. We feel that the negative impacts of this decision are far&nbsp; outweighed by the immediate and long term benefits to both the&nbsp; Hawaiian Chieftain and the Gray's Harbor Seaport Authority as a whole.</p> <p>This decision addresses an issue that has been on our minds for a very&nbsp; long time. We each have our individual viewpoints, experiences, and&nbsp; reasons for supporting our captain. After discussion of those reasons,&nbsp; we have found ourselves in agreement with the following statements:</p> <p>1. The Gray's Harbor Historical Seaport Authority has a history of&nbsp; under staffing and failing to plan ahead for crew rotation which&nbsp; continues to the present.</p> <p>2. The process of compensating for missing crew members puts a heavy&nbsp; strain on the crew.</p> <p>3. Without a full complement of officer crew, we do not function fully&nbsp; as a boat.</p> <p>4. The recurring lack of core crew on the Hawaiian Chieftain is an&nbsp; immediate hazard to the boat and a long term hazard to the very&nbsp; stability and existence of our organization, and needs to be addressed.</p> <p>5. The benefits we gain in recognizing and correcting this problem now&nbsp; are immediate and concrete.</p> <p>6. We as a crew have set upon this course of action only because we&nbsp; feel we have no other recourse. We do this out of a sense of affection&nbsp; and care for our boat, our crew, our organization, and our mission.</p> <p>In closing, we would like to state that it is not our intention to&nbsp; impugn the hard work and dedication of any individual or faction of&nbsp; the Gray's Harbor Historical Seaport Authority. There has historically&nbsp; been a level of alienation and animosity between the boats and the&nbsp; office which we wish to do away with. Things have gotten pretty awful&nbsp; here on the Chieftain recently, and this is the only way we could&nbsp; think of to effectively express the level of dysfunction we are&nbsp; experiencing. Our hope is that through this action we successfully&nbsp; express our need for our crew recruitment practices to change. We&nbsp; recognize that this responsibility lies with each and every one of us.&nbsp; This is an organization-wide dysfunction that needs to be addressed on&nbsp; an organization-wide level. We as a crew commit ourselves to doing&nbsp; whatever is necessary to support the Gray's Harbor Historical Seaport&nbsp; Authority, our boat, each other, the communities we interact with, and&nbsp; our mission as an organization. We regard this action as a painful and&nbsp; necessary step to honor those commitments.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Jesse Loge, Chief Mate Elizabeth Foretek, Bosun Nick Williams, Engineer Lee Newberry, Steward Sarah Cosper, Cook</p> <p>******************************************</p> <p>Full explanation of above concerns:</p> <p>Having made those statements, we wish for there to be no confusion as&nbsp; to our intentions or our reasons for supporting this action. We&nbsp; therefore provide the supporting logic and reasoning for each point&nbsp; below:</p> <p>1. The Gray's Harbor Historical Seaport Authority has a history of&nbsp; understaffing and failing to plan ahead for crew rotation which&nbsp; continues to the present.</p> <p>-For the past several years, it has been regular to experience gaps in&nbsp; staffing between the end of one crewmember's contract and the&nbsp; beginning of their replacement's. It has frequently been the case that&nbsp; the search for a new member of the core crew has not begun until the&nbsp; previous crewmember has left the boat.</p> <p>-Our organization also has a history of filling positions in a stopgap&nbsp; fashion by hiring crewmembers for two weeks or a month at a time, at&nbsp; which point the process begins again.</p> <p>-The Hawaiian Chieftain requires eight core crew plus three deckhands&nbsp; to fill all positions on an education sail and allow for crewmembers&nbsp; to get regular days off. In the past twelve weeks, the vessel has at&nbsp; no time operated with all eight core crew and three or more volunteers.</p> <p>-On April 15th, the Education Coordinator ended his contracted time on&nbsp; the vessel and left. On April 23 rd, the Purser's contract extension&nbsp; ended and she left. This was forseen months in advance. As of today,&nbsp; the Hawaiian Chieftain is still without a Purser or Education&nbsp; Coordinator.</p> <p>2. The process of compensating for missing crewmembers puts a heavy&nbsp; strain on the crew.</p> <p>-We do this by either dividing up the job, or asking one crewmember to&nbsp; pull double duty. For instance, if the Steward is missing, the&nbsp; Education Coordinator may handle tours and press interaction while the&nbsp; Purser handles ticket sales, sail bookings, and passenger&nbsp; interactions. Alternatively, the Purser may be assigned all Steward&nbsp; duties until a new Steward is hired. The decision is made based upon&nbsp; the position needing to be compensated for, the experience and skill&nbsp; level of the other crewmembers, and the length of time that the&nbsp; position will remain unfilled.</p> <p>-Each of the core crew positions demand a considerable amount of skill&nbsp; and personal resources to be carried out well. They require&nbsp; experience, specialized training, and sustained dedication on the part&nbsp; of the officer. They are not lightly taken up.</p> <p>-In addition to the specialized duties of the officer positions, every&nbsp; member of the core crew must bear a certain amount of the workload&nbsp; associated with the general operations of the boat. Maintenance, sail&nbsp; handling, teaching, public interaction and crew training constitute an&nbsp; enormous workload that requires a team effort to manage.</p> <p>-Between the specialized and general duties, each of the core crew&nbsp; jobs produces enough work to keep an individual occupied for twelve&nbsp; hours a day, every day.</p> <p>-When the crew compensates for an unfilled position, each individual&nbsp; crewmember must necessarily choose between fulfilling every task given&nbsp; to them or caring for themselves. For instance, an Education&nbsp; Coordinator who is filling in for the Purser must spend a certain&nbsp; amount of time after evening muster doing the paperwork associated&nbsp; with both positions instead of taking a shower or doing laundry.</p> <p>-By putting their personal needs on hold, a crew can compensate for an&nbsp; unfilled position for brief periods of time. After a period of weeks&nbsp; or even months, however, individual crewmembers begin to burn out as&nbsp; the effects of their self-neglect become apparent. Crewmembers become&nbsp; visibly weary, pessimistic in their outlook, cynical in their&nbsp; opinions, unkempt in their personal effects. A crewmember with a&nbsp; significant work related injury may have to fulfill sail handling&nbsp; duties instead of convalescing, because there was is crewmember left&nbsp; to cover for them.</p> <p>-Eventually burned out crewmembers leave the boat feeling badly about&nbsp; the Gray's Harbor organization as a whole, and speak badly of it on&nbsp; other boats. This diminishes our reputation and hurts our organization&nbsp; in the long run.</p> <p>3. Without a full complement of officer crew, we do not function fully&nbsp; as a boat.</p> <p>-While compensating for an unfilled position, crewmembers are also&nbsp; forced to choose between fulfilling their contracted duties and&nbsp; fulfilling their temporary duties. For instance, an Engineer who is&nbsp; also Mate must choose between organizing the crew in their daily&nbsp; routine and changing oil filters on schedule.</p> <p>-Each officer will prioritize their duties and choose the least&nbsp; pressing of them to leave unfinished. As time goes on, however, the&nbsp; unfinished duties begin to compound themselves and become pressing&nbsp; issues. For instance, a torn bit of chafe gear that is left unattended&nbsp; will allow a critical line to wear through, compromising the rig.</p> <p>-As the days and weeks wear on, the boat begins to break down in many&nbsp; small ways. The deficiencies begin to interact and create a hazardous&nbsp; work environment. For example, loose gear and personal effects clutter&nbsp; the hold, creating an unstable compartment underway.</p> <p>-In addition, the officers who have been given additional specific&nbsp; duties have less time and energy to devote to general crew tasks. The&nbsp; sail handlers on public sails become slower to react to commands.&nbsp; Fewer crewmembers are available to do necessary maintenance. Those who&nbsp; make themselves available become more likely to make simple mistakes.&nbsp; The rigorous habits that make shipboard life clean and safe get laid&nbsp; by the wayside. This creates an environment ripe for accidents.</p> <p>4. The recurring lack of core crew on the Hawaiian Chieftain is an&nbsp; immediate hazard to the boat and a long term hazard to the very&nbsp; stability and existence of our organization, and needs to be addressed.</p> <p>-If the boat goes without core crewmembers for a short period of time,&nbsp; small things get missed and are attended to when the crew roster is&nbsp; filled. When the crew positions go unfilled for a long period of time,&nbsp; critical systems begin to break down. The rig goes untuned for several&nbsp; months. The bilge pumps are not maintained properly. Scaling rust&nbsp; forms on the hull where the paint has been scraped. A critical piece&nbsp; of standing rig breaks and is replaced by a quick fix that is kept in&nbsp; the rig through multiple transits. New crew members are not fully&nbsp; trained in emergency procedures.</p> <p>-These breakdowns are not noticed on an organizational level because&nbsp; they do not interfere with the business of the boat on paper.&nbsp; Education programs, public tours, and sails all happen as scheduled.</p> <p>-Boat life is unpredictable. At any point, a crewmember may experience&nbsp; a family emergency, or a pipe may break in the engine room, or a spar&nbsp; may crack, or the boat may encounter fierce, unexpected weather. Part&nbsp; of what makes boat life safe is the buffer that is put in place for&nbsp; unforeseen emergencies. Compartments are cleaned rigorously, crew&nbsp; members are trained to handle the rig with incredible speed and&nbsp; efficiency, and every boat system is kept in meticulous order.</p> <p>-When core crew positions are left unfilled, this buffer goes away. If&nbsp; the crew is pushing hard just to sail the boat, nobody is available to&nbsp; help a passenger who suffers heatstroke. If a crewmember experiences a&nbsp; family emergency, the boat cannot spare him a day off to attend to it.&nbsp; If he takes the day regardless, the boat may find itself with too few&nbsp; crew to sail safely. A good example came up in the battle sail on May&nbsp; 5th. The crew member who was tending the Mizzen sail had to leave his&nbsp; post in order to instruct new volunteers on how to handle the braces&nbsp; during the middle of a tack. They had not been previously trained due&nbsp; to lack of available crew. Meanwhile, the Mizzen boom was swinging&nbsp; over the heads of passengers that no one was able to pay attention to.&nbsp; The Hawaiian Chieftain has a very tight and interdependent rig. When&nbsp; the core crew is reduced to six, situations like this become&nbsp; commonplace.</p> <p>-While we, as employees of the Gray's Harbor Historical Seaport, recognize the need to keep revenue programs running, we feel that we are putting&nbsp; ourselves and our organization to be in real danger by continuing in&nbsp; this fashion. All it takes is one lawsuit by a seriously injured&nbsp; passenger to jeopardize our entire operation. If a critical part of&nbsp; our rig breaks after months of neglect, we may lose tens of thousands&nbsp; of dollars in revenue as well as the cost associated with repair. A&nbsp; crewmember who has not had a day off in nine weeks or adequate sleep&nbsp; in two may make life threatening mistakes while climbing aloft.</p> <p>-If we are interested in the safety and health of our boats and our&nbsp; organization, we cannot continue as we are.</p> <p>-The specific situation we find ourselves in on the Hawaiian Chieftain&nbsp; is as follows: We have three crewmembers on board who have previously&nbsp; served on the vessel. They are the Captain, Mate and Steward. The&nbsp; Engineer, Bosun, and Cook all have previous experience in their jobs,&nbsp; but are still learning the specifics of this boat. We have no long&nbsp; term volunteers. There are additionally six volunteers from the&nbsp; Evergreen State College who are training as deckhands while engaging&nbsp; in their own scholastic program. Of these twelve crewmembers, four are&nbsp; well versed in the education program, including the Captain and Mate.&nbsp; The rest are somewhat familiar with it, but need training and&nbsp; attention to carry it out to the level of quality that schools have&nbsp; come to expect from Gray's Harbor tallships. The Captain is the only&nbsp; individual aboard who is trained to do the Purser's paperwork. The&nbsp; current Bosun is faced with catching up on months' worth of neglect in&nbsp; the rig. The decision, therefore, to stop education programs in favor&nbsp; of training the new crewmembers and attending to our badly neglected&nbsp; rig is a natural one.</p> <p>5. The benefits we gain in recognizing and correcting this problem now&nbsp; are immediate and concrete.</p> <p>-A full roster of eight core crew plus at least three volunteer&nbsp; deckhands allows the crew to:</p> <p>-Receive regular days off</p> <p>-Train new crew effectively</p> <p>-Do preventative maintenance on the rig and engineering systems</p> <p>-Practice and prepare for emergencies</p> <p>-Study for endorsements, such as AB Sail and Captain's licenses</p> <p>-Regularly attend to personal health and hygiene, emotional and physical</p> <p>-Communicate regularly and fully with the office</p> <p>-Respond quickly and effectively to emergencies</p> <p>-Step aboard other boats with words of praise and recommendation for&nbsp; Gray's Harbor tallships.</p> <p>-A regular, seasonal rotation of crew will lend an immeasurable amount&nbsp; of stability to our organization. We will save many man-hours of work&nbsp; training new officers to their duties. We will eliminate the&nbsp; insecurity associated with taking dock jumpers aboard as essential&nbsp; crew. We will be able to undertake significant, necessary maintenance&nbsp; projects on board knowing that we will have to crew to finish them. We&nbsp; will rid ourselves of much of the pessimism and cynicism that pervades&nbsp; the crew's attitude toward the office. We will have a crew that feels&nbsp; supported, energetic, and able to manage their duties effectively.</p> <p>-This goal is well within reach. All we need to do is change a few of&nbsp; our assumptions and habits. It is not easy, but it is necessary.</p> <p>-This is not a process that cannot happen without good communication&nbsp; between every level of our organization. Our inter-organization&nbsp; communications have gotten noticeably better over the past few years.&nbsp; Let us not forget this.</p> <p>6. We as a crew have set upon this course of action only because we&nbsp; feel we have no other recourse. We do this out of a sense of affection&nbsp; and care for our boat, our crew, our organization, and our mission.</p> <p>-We understand fully that by leaving the Education Coordinator and&nbsp; Purser duties unfulfilled we are doing an immediate disservice to the&nbsp; schools we have contracted with and our mission as a boat. We feel&nbsp; that the short term ramifications of this are far outweighed by the&nbsp; disservice we do to our passengers when we sail with a poorly&nbsp; maintained boat and a fatigued crew.</p> <p>-We believe sincerely that if the Education coordinator and Purser&nbsp; duties are carried out as usual in this port that this problem will&nbsp; cease to be addressed on an organizational level.</p> <p>-It is important to note that the crewmembers currently aboard have&nbsp; not chosen to stop or fail in their duties. We have simply chosen to&nbsp; focus on the duties we have neglected over the past several weeks&nbsp; instead of the duties that we have taken up to cover for missing&nbsp; crewmembers. The Mate is still organizing the crew, the Bosun is still&nbsp; maintaining the rig, the Engineer is still attending to the ship's&nbsp; systems, the Steward is still greeting the community and introducing&nbsp; people to the boat, and the Cook is still nourishing the crew.</p> <p>-The time for immediate stopgap fixes to recurring problems is past.&nbsp; We need to mature as an organization and look forward to the long term&nbsp; stability and well-being of our organization.</p> <p>- We must recognize our current problems as symptoms of a systemic&nbsp; dysfunction. Rather than simply attend to the symptoms, me must&nbsp; address the issue as a whole, looking toward the long term benefit&nbsp; rather than the short term obstacle. If we fail to so this, we will&nbsp; find ourselves in this predicament again and again.</p> <p>- If we successfully institute a new, healthy model of crew&nbsp; recruitment, the Gray's Harbor Historical Seaport Authority as an&nbsp; organization and the Hawaiian Chieftain as a boat will function&nbsp; significantly better. This will allow us to focus our energies on our&nbsp; core mission of education and community outreach.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_27 first"><a href="../../category/union-news/news-all-departments-and-unions/department-500-transportation-and-communication/index/" rel="tag" title="This page displays *all* news items from Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union 510.
