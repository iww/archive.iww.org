<p><b>Meet Joe Hill, By Tom Walsh - <i>Sacramento News and Review</i>
Editor's note.</b></p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/IU530/stockton/coversacto.jpg" align="right" border="1" /> "Hello?"</p>
<p><i>"You've got to get down here right away. They're tearing down the
Morrison grocery building."</i></p>
<p>"And the significance of that is ..."</p>
<p><i>"Geez. You don't know the story of the Wobblies and Joe
Hill?"</i></p>
<p>I didn't, but I would. I was working as a reporter in Salt
Lake City, and soon I would be fascinated by the Joe Hill arrest and
execution. Like many people my age, I was woefully under-informed about
the history of the radical labor movement in this country.</p>
<p>Joe Hill (actually Hillström) was an organizer for the very independent
union known as the Wobblies. The Wobblies were organizing in the dangerous
mines in Utah in 1914. Hill was known as the Wobbly troubadour, and he
penned many songs that delighted followers and infuriated mine owners.</p>
<p>A grocer named Morrison was killed when shots were fired during a
holdup. Two men were seen running from the store. And two men were
arrested while fleeing at a nearby rail yard; one was wounded. Both were
wanted in Arizona on a robbery charge.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hill got shot (many now believe it was by a jealous
husband), and he was turned in by a doctor.</p>
<p>Guess who was charged with the murder. Purely circumstantial evidence
somehow led to his conviction. A storm of protest ensued, and even
President Woodrow Wilson's request for clemency or a new trial was
denied.</p>
<p>Hill was resigned to the fact that he would be put to death by a firing
squad. He asked that his body be taken out of state, saying, "I don't want
to be caught dead in Utah." And his last message: "Don't
mourn--organize."</p>
<p>Hill and other strong characters in the Wobblies make for a fascinating
and sad history lesson. Many Wobblies were killed by mobs and vigilantes,
and many others were beaten and thrown in jail.</p>
<p>But perhaps more interesting than their history is the Wobblies'
resurgence in our area (see below), with an unlikely group of new
members.</p>
<p class="redbar">Here Come the Wobblies!</p>
<p><b>By Cosmo Garvin - <i>Sacramento News &amp; Review</i> - January 13,
2005.</b></p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/portraits/JoeHill/joehillposter.gif" align="right" height="247" width="170" />In a labor battle with roots dating back 100 years,
independent truckers and Starbucks employees are now joining the wild and
contentious Wobblies.</p>
<p>On a fog-soaked December morning, near an Interstate 5 offramp on the
outskirts of Stockton, about a dozen men huddled in a loose circle. Some
wore the traditional long beards and Sikh turbans of their native India.
The younger men were mostly clean-shaven and sported brand-name
windbreakers. To the north was a truck dealership. To the south, shrouded
in the fog, was a dog-food factory.</p>
<p>The men spoke animatedly in Punjabi and then broke up, shuffling around
the empty lot, talking on cell phones and killing time. Occasionally, a
taller man would call them together again for another meeting.</p>
<p>This is what a wildcat truckers strike looks like in the Stockton
Valley.</p>
<p>These were independent, short-haul truckers, mostly recent immigrants
from India. Although they own their own trucks and technically are
self-employed, these drivers usually contract exclusively with one company
and depend on that company for all of their work. In this case, the
company is Kach Transportation.</p>
<p>But, for three days in December, none of these drivers hauling for Kach
went to work. And the company couldn't move goods from the area rail yards
to the stores and warehouses in the surrounding communities, like
Stockton, Sacramento, Modesto, Woodland and points in between.</p>
<p>There were no angry chants or workers marching around with picket
signs. No fiery speeches by bullhorn and no press conference. Just a bunch
of fed-up truckers not going to work. And yet these men are part of a
unique labor tradition dating back a century.</p>
<p>The only real clues linking them to the tradition were a few signs
bearing a slogan from a bygone era--"An injury to one is an injury to
all"--planted in the wet ground around the perimeter of the lot.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/portraits/MotherJones/MotherJones.jpg" align="left" border="1" />"The company, they won't talk to us at all," the tall man
explained. "We said, 'Come talk to us. You know, we might let go of a few
things, you let go of a few things, and it will work out.' But they just
said no."</p>
<p>Like most of the Kach drivers, he asked SN&amp;R not to print his name,
fearing he would be singled out by employers and not be able to find work.
Indeed, the truckers seemed suspicious of reporters generally and had made
no efforts to contact the press about their spontaneous strike.</p>
<p>The Kach drivers went on strike December 14, demanding more pay for
rising fuel costs and an end to onerous "wait times," during which the
drivers must remain idle without pay while their trucks are loaded or
unloaded. It was a small strike but the latest in a string of labor
actions by short-haul truckers in the last year.</p>
<p>The Stockton drivers claim they sparked a wave of independent-trucker
strikes along the West Coast and then across the country in the spring of
2004. "We were the first. Then Oakland, then everywhere," the tall man
explained. Truckers as far away as Los Angeles and ultimately Miami and
Savannah, Ga., tied up ports and railheads with spontaneous work
stoppages.</p>
<p>The drivers, whether in Stockton or Seattle, are an important part of
the backbone of the "containerized economy" ferrying goods from ports and
rail yards to your local Costco or Wal-Mart, or the myriad warehouses and
distributors up and down the West Coast.</p>
<p>The loads they haul could be just about any dry goods, from laundry
detergent to toilet paper to children's toys. One load, from Stockton to
Sacramento for example, might net a driver $120. The truck operators pay
for their own insurance, gas and vehicle maintenance. Often, they are
still making payments on their rigs.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/photos/bandw/events/firehosesonworkerslawrence.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="136" width="170" />By and large, they don't belong
to unions.</p>
<p>Or, at least, not the unions you'd expect.</p>
<p>Over the summer, the Kach drivers, and the vast majority of short-haul
truckers in the Stockton Valley, recently joined the Industrial Workers of
the World (IWW), also known as the Wobblies. The union says it has signed
up around 220 of the 350 or so independent truckers working in the
area.</p>
<p>Not bad for a union that was considered extinct 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The IWW was founded 100 years ago in 1905. In the 1910s and 1920s, the
Wobblies were a fearsome presence in the American labor movement,
representing radical unionism in its most militant and subversive form. It
stood for anti-capitalist revolution and took as its motto "A world
without bosses."</p>
<p>Most of the Sikh truck drivers don't consider themselves radicals. But
they found the Wobblies were the only union that could, or would, help
them. And although trucking companies have refused to recognize their
union, the Wobbly truckers have been busy building the union, making
demands and sometimes winning concessions.</p>
<p>Most members live in Stockton, Modesto, Sacramento and other valley
towns and drive to work in Stockton. Companies like Kach do the
dispatching, working with brokers and the railroads to arrange pickups and
deliveries. The truckers then drive their rigs to the Stockton rail
yards--the Union Pacific, Santa Fe or Burlington Northern--pick up their
loads and deliver them to stores and warehouses anywhere within 150 miles
of Stockton.</p>
<p>The drivers are overwhelmingly Indian, and many are recent immigrants.
Drivers said this was partly due to the natural networking that occurs in
the local Sikh community, with truckers helping their friends and family
members get into the business. Others said it's not bad work for
immigrants with limited English skills, because interaction with the
public is brief at most.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/IU530/stockton/cover-4.jpg" align="left" border="1" height="166" width="250" /> "Mostly, it's Indian drivers, but we've made some
inroads into the Latino community," explained Harjit Gill, not a truck
driver but a Punjabi-speaking Wobbly organizer from Chico. "Once we sign
[the Latinos] up, we'll have everybody."</p>
<p>It would be a small campaign for a major union like the Teamsters or
the California Nurses Association. But to the Wobblies in this country,
it's a huge victory. In fact, it is the largest single influx of new
members that the Wobblies have seen in several decades. And it's a sign
that the IWW gradually is shaking the rust out and becoming something more
than an anarchist historical society. And the Wobblies could become a
force to reckon with again. Indeed, in 2001, the nationally known law firm
Bullivant Houser Bailey was warning its clients, "Employers should beware,
the Wobblies are back."</p>
<p>The Stockton truckers' campaign, combined with a small but steady
growth of Wobbly memberships in other communities and a high-profile
attempt to unionize Starbucks coffee shops on the East Coast, is getting
the IWW attention it hasn't seen in years. For Wobbly organizers, it's a
nice way to celebrate turning 100.</p>
<p>But on the fourth day of the Wobblies' Kach strike, it became clear the
company wasn't budging.</p>
<p>"They said they would only talk to us individually, not as a group,"
the tall man explained. Rather than submit to one-on-one meetings with the
boss, the Kach truckers decided on a more Wobbly-esque strategy of dealing
with an intractable employer: They quit hauling for Kach.</p>
<p>"We're going to try our best to put them out of business," Gill
explained. "They don't care about workers, so we don't care about
them."</p>
<p>Kach managers did not return calls from SN&amp;R. Truckers say that on the
day after they stopped work, Kach did offer to negotiate, but the drivers
refused to go back to work, in part to send a message.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/IU530/stockton/cover-5.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="211" />"We just told them it was too late. If they're going
to muck about, we can find work somewhere else," said one driver, who
already had lined up a job at another trucking company.</p>
<p>Although the Teamsters voiced support for the spring strikes, the
powerful trucking union--an obvious choice to help truckers looking for a
better deal--did little actual organizing among the Stockton truck
drivers. This is largely because they're independent operators, and
federal law doesn't allow them to join unions.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, these <i>were</i> union jobs, said Chuck Mack, the
national director of port operations for the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. "In the '80s, we had the whole Oakland waterfront organized,"
Mack explained. But then came the deregulation movement of the 1980s. Over
time, the carrier companies moved away from employing drivers directly and
created a system of independent contractors.</p>
<p>As a result, the drivers aren't technically employees and no longer
have the same rights to negotiate as a union. As the working conditions in
the trucking industry deteriorated, Mack said, the workforce changed,
drawing much more heavily from ethnic minorities and immigrants.</p>
<p>The Teamsters are working with these truckers, but "you have to be
very, very careful, or you might run afoul of antitrust laws," Mack said.
Federal laws like the Sherman Anti-Trust Act prohibit companies from
colluding to set prices. That includes independent business owners and
contractors. Conceivably, Mack said, a trucking company could sue a union
of independent truckers for violating the laws against price fixing.</p>
<p>"It's completely hypocritical," Mack complained. "That law is over 100
years old. It was intended to protect workers from the JP Morgans and
Rockefellers. Now it's being used against these immigrant workers who are
just scraping by."</p>
<p>Enter the IWW, with its historic disdain for any federal law it deems
"anti-worker." Gill, then living in Chico, teamed up with Bay Area IWW
organizers Bruce Valde and Adam Welch. After being invited by a few Sikh
truckers who participated in the spring strikes, the group took a chance
and went to Stockton to look into the possibility of organizing a truckers
union.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/IU530/stockton/cover-6.jpg" align="left" border="1" height="164" width="250" />Soon they had signed up a majority of the Stockton
Valley independent short-haul truckers as members of the IWW. In
September, drivers at Patriot Logistics, by then holding IWW union cards,
held another strike. They said that company officials had promised them
higher pay to make up for increasing gas prices. They also suspected that
the company already was collecting higher rates from its customers but
wasn't passing the increase on to drivers. "The brokers were paying them,
but they weren't giving it to us," said Patriot driver Dewey Obitinalla.
"We were each losing about $200 a week." They also sought more pay for
that downtime they spent waiting to pick up goods at area rail yards and
warehouses.</p>
<p>After staying off the job for three days (and losing three days' pay),
the drivers say they won about 80 percent of what they wanted--including a
small increase in their basic rates, to cover fuel costs, and an agreement
to increase pay for wait times.</p>
<p>The company, however, refuses to acknowledge that any bargaining
occurred with the IWW. "It simply didn't happen. We have contracts with
individual truck drivers. Those contracts haven't changed and won't
change," said Patriot Vice President of Marketing John Tucker from his
home in Atlanta, Ga. "We would not sit with a group of drivers and
negotiate," Tucker added. "And we certainly wouldn't talk to any union
people."</p>
<p>But negotiations did occur, the drivers say. They also contend the
manager that negotiated with the drivers no longer works for Patriot
because the man was fired. Although Tucker denied that, he refused to
elaborate, saying it was a private personnel matter.</p>
<p>Patriot drivers say that, whether the company wants to recognize the
union or not, their strike worked.</p>
<p>"It helped. Not a lot, but it helped," said Obitinalla. "This is really
the first time I've seen these kinds of demands negotiated. In the five
years I've been in this business, my experience is that the managers won't
do anything unless they see this kind of unity."</p>
<p>Not a bad result for the price of IWW dues, which are $6 a month. "They
don't really make you pay it anyway," Obitinalla remarked.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/IU530/stockton/cover-7.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="164" width="250" />Just the mention of the name Industrial Workers of
the World today evokes memories of the early American labor movement in
its most militant, most revolutionary and, in some cases, most terrifying
form.</p>
<p>To historians, the IWW means the 1912 strike in Lawrence, Mass., when
20,000 textile workers faced down the state's National Guard, chanting,
"We want bread and roses!" Or it evokes the now-forgotten bombing of the
California governor's mansion in 1917, blamed on the IWW--though the union
to this day disputes the charge. Or the execution of troubadour and IWW
organizer Joe Hill in Utah in 1915. Hill was convicted of shooting a shop
owner to death during a robbery gone bad. Hill and supporters claimed all
along that he was framed and executed only because the government wanted
the radical dead.</p>
<p>Of course, the Wobblies (some say the name comes from the "wobble saw"
used by loggers in the Pacific Northwest at the turn of the century) also
have a history of more joyful forms of subversion. Many Wobblies were
hobos and drifters, riding empty rail cars for free all over the country.
And Wobbly songwriters like Hill penned popular and irreverent tunes
skewering the bosses and celebrating the working class: songs like "Rebel
Girl," "Fifty-Thousand Lumberjacks" and "I'm Too Old to Be a Scab." In
California, carrying a copy of the Wobblies' <u>Little Red Songbook</u>
could land you in jail.</p>
<p>The Wobbly leaders of 1905 would become legendary hell-raisers, leaders
like Eugene Debs, Mother Jones and Big Bill Haywood.</p>
<p>Then there's the class of 2005.</p>
<p>"The working class and the employing class <i>still</i> have nothing in
common," explained the smiling Gill, updating the preamble to the
constitution of the IWW, written in Chicago in 1905.</p>
<p>Then, as now, they advocated "anarcho-syndicalism," in which workers
themselves seized the means of production--the factory works, the sawmill,
the city buses--and determined for themselves how production would be
organized and what working conditions would be.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/sabocats/sabcat_redgrey.jpg" align="left" height="178" width="170" />The Wobblies promoted the idea of the "One Big Union," also
called industrial unionism. Rather than splitting workers into trade
unions--carpenters, electricians or bricklayers, for example--the Wobblies
insisted that all construction workers struggle together to change the
construction industry.</p>
<p>And they had little patience for union bureaucracy, fussing over union
elections and contracts or asking the government (the National Labor
Relations Board, or NLRB) for the right to negotiate.</p>
<p>Instead, they adopted the slogan "Direct action gets the goods."
Strikes were to be used early and often. "General strikes" by workers
across industries, and hopefully shutting down a whole city, were even
better.</p>
<p>And they had a reputation, not entirely deserved, for industrial
sabotage. Although some workers did go in for destroying company property,
the IWW concept of sabotage tended toward work slowdowns or "working to
rule"--meaning adhering to job rules so carefully that work grinds to a
halt. Still, Wobbly lore is full of stories of chicanery, of machines
mysteriously missing belts or paint being mixed the wrong color by
accident. To this day, the Wobblies hold dear their mascot, "Sabo Kitty,"
an angry black cat with its hair on end, which came to be a symbol for
sabotage.</p>
<p>The IWW also became associated, rightly or wrongly, with terrible
violence.</p>
<p>Following the governor's- mansion bombing in 1917, 53 Sacramento
Wobblies were jailed, and three of them died in custody. But many
suspected the bombings actually were carried out by supporters of the
local district attorney, Charles Fickert, who had built his career
prosecuting Wobblies.</p>
<p>Fickert also sent the notorious Wobbly leader Tom Mooney to jail for
allegedly tossing a bomb into a San Francisco Preparedness Day parade,
killing 10 people. Again, Mooney's supporters said it was the work of
<i>agents provocateur</i>. Mooney was in fact pardoned in 1938 by Governor
Culbert Olson.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/IU530/stockton/cover-9.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="164" width="250" />At the height of their power before World War I, the
Wobblies boasted more than 100,000 members, who ruled the shipping and
transportation industries. They were the first to advance many causes of
the American labor movement, the first to include people of color in a
union with white workers and the first to fight for the eight-hour day and
the 40-hour week, all things that workers in America came to take for
granted in the late 20th century.</p>
<p>They also were feared and despised by big companies, the U.S.
government and the trade unions of the American Federation of Labor.</p>
<p>"They were a major threat, because they were so strong in these key
industries, because they were anarchists, and they totally opposed the
war," said Dana Frank, a professor of history at Merrill College. In 1917
and 1918, more than 2,000 Wobblies were jailed, many for criticizing the
war.</p>
<p>Government crackdowns and mass arrests during World War I smashed the
union, and it never really recovered to its prewar power. "After that,
they really turned into a movement to free political prisoners," namely
their own members, Frank explained. By 1990, some estimates put IWW
membership at around 1,000.</p>
<p>But the IWW did survive into the latter 20th century, mostly in leftist
strongholds like the Bay Area and the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Then, the IWW organized a big chunk of the city of Berkeley's curbside
recycling program back in 1988. For driver Dominic Moschella, joining a
Wobbly shop was a natural move because he was attracted to the union's
radical politics. But he also was attracted to the idea of a blue-collar
job that paid a decent wage. "Where else can you work 20 or 24 hours a
week and make $40,000 a year?" he asked.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Wobblies expanded their membership in the recycling
business, organizing the 20-person workforce at Community Conservation
Centers where residential recycling is sorted, by hand, into paper,
plastic and aluminum streams. After joining the Wobblies, workers there
hammered out a contract that increased the wages slightly and included
full medical benefits and paid time off.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/cartoons/iww/one-big-fist2.jpg" align="left" border="1" height="139" width="170" />The most recent Bay Area victory was at
Stonemountain and Daughter, a fabric shop on Shattuck Avenue. The workers
there, mostly older women who are skilled seamstresses and knitters,
formed a union two years ago. Their main complaints were of favoritism, a
lack of medical benefits and a lack of respect from the owner.</p>
<p>With organizer Bruce Valde's help, they landed a contract in the summer
of 2004. Starting pay was increased, and a regular raise schedule was put
in place. The company also has made some initial steps in providing health
insurance to its workers.</p>
<p>Whether it's recycling workers or the clerks at the fabric store or
truck drivers in the Stockton Valley, Valde said, the IWW radical politics
take a backseat.</p>
<p>"These people don't care about the ideology," Valde explained. "They
care about having a decent paycheck and a decent place to work. And they
want somebody to stand up with them and support them."</p>
<p>The Stockton campaign and the modest gains of shops organized in
Berkeley, Portland, Chicago and other places around the country are signs
of life not seen from the IWW in years.</p>
<p>"There is certainly a level of activity and a sense of our place in the
labor movement that feels very different," said Alexis Buss, the general
secretary treasurer of the IWW, headquartered in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>She said that the IWW membership has been gaining in steady, small
percentages since the late 1990s. "We just got a big bump this year
because of Stockton," she explained, adding that donations have been
coming in from union members all over the country to help with the
Stockton campaign.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/agitators/classic/OBUclassic.jpg" align="right" height="213" width="170" />The Wobblies stress that it's the workers, not the
IWW organizers, who call the shots. "If you want to get something done in
your shop, we're here to help. But we follow their lead," said Berkeley
organizer Valde. And though the IWW has become a full-time job for Valde
and the other Bay Area organizers, they remain unpaid volunteers. Of the
2,000 or so IWW members in the United States, Buss is the only one who
gets a regular paycheck from the union.</p>
<p>While bottom-up organization is a time-honored Wobbly tradition, so is
being in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>Daniel Gross is one of the main IWW organizers trying to get a union in
Starbucks in New York City. There, workers at one store won the right to
hold a union election from the New York regional office of the NLRB in the
summer of 2004. Even pursuing such an election was the subject of much
debate among the New York Wobblies, and IWW members around the country,
because the union sees the NLRB as mostly useless.</p>
<p>The point became moot, however, when Starbucks appealed the approval of
the election to the NLRB higher -ups. The Washington office accepted the
appeal, effectively stalling the election for at least two years.</p>
<p>Daniel Gross and other Starbucks workers protested these tactics during
the Republican National Convention in New York this past fall. Gross was
arrested for blocking the entrance to the store, and Starbucks decided to
press charges. His trial is set to begin January 14. Ironically, Gross
still works at the store he was arrested in front of. His lawyer, Leonard
Weinglass--the famous civil-rights attorney who defended members of the
Chicago 8 and Mumia Abu-Jamal--has described the charges against Gross as
"politically motivated."</p>
<p>He faces up to six months in jail for disorderly conduct and resisting
arrest, though he says his attorney will present plenty of evidence that
he did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>"It's all about chilling our First Amendment rights. I have no doubt
that if I'm convicted, Starbucks will use this to try and scare workers
away from the union," Gross said.</p>
<p>Starbucks spokesperson Audrey Lincoff said that the company had
absolutely nothing to do with Gross' criminal case, noting that it was the
local district attorney--not Starbucks--that brought the charges against
him.</p>
<p>And Lincoff said the company is not anti-union. "We are pro-partner,"
Lincoff explained. The company refers to all of its employees as
"partners."</p>
<p>"We don't try to influence their decisions. We do provide a progressive
and flexible work environment for all of our partners."</p>
<p>But the regional NLRB issued an unfair-labor-practices complaint
against Starbucks last week, accusing the company of trying to interfere
with workers' right to join the union. The complaint includes allegations
that the company interrogated employees about their support for the union
and promised promotions to workers who withdrew their support for it.</p>
<p>Lincoff wouldn't comment on the complaint, saying Starbucks was still
reviewing it.</p>
<p><img src="../../graphics/books/SongBook.jpg" align="left" border="1" />With the
IWW's striking, romantic symbolism and confrontational culture, it's not
surprising that younger activists would be attracted to it and would want
to dust off the <u>Little Red Songbook</u> and declare it time to "Fire
your boss!"</p>
<p>Gill himself, though only 23, is a veteran of protests against
multinational corporations and liberalized trade rules. He took to the
streets with the Black Bloc anarchists during the biotech conference in
Sacramento in June 2003 and said the World Trade Organization (WTO)
protests in Seattle 1999 were an awakening for him.</p>
<p>Radical unionism is simply an extension of the work he's done around
free trade and multinational corporations. "I know a lot of people my age
who are really conscious of the WTO and [the North American Free Trade
Agreement]. But they're not standing here in a dirty parking lot" with
striking truck drivers, he explained.</p>
<p>"We're back, but in a totally different way," Gill said. "I think
you're going to see this union go through something of a transformation.
You're going to see younger people and people of color. And you' re going
to see a more community-oriented approach to organizing."</p>
<p>For them, the IWW may be an appealing alternative to a labor movement
that has had the doldrums for two decades.</p>
<p>But just being alternative won't be enough, says Teamster Chuck Mack.
Short-haul truckers, in Stockton and across the country, need all the help
they can get, and the IWW is welcome, he said. "But I think it's a little
simplistic to say that what they are doing will move the ports and the
shippers and get them to open their wallets." Mack said real improvement
of working conditions for these truckers requires changing the rules. In
fact, Mack testified before a select committee of the California
Legislature on January 7, asking lawmakers to change the rules to allow
independent truckers to bargain as part of a union. "These [truckers] need
help, so whatever works. The IWW is out there doing the right thing, but I
think it's going to take a much broader coalition," Mack added.</p>
<p>Still, whether it's the WTO or a single trucking company, Gill puts his
faith in direct action.</p>
<p>"Everything in America moves on a truck at some point. An important
part of trying to change the way that trade works is having the power to
stop trade. That's what we did here. We said until people's rights to
survive are adhered to, we're not going to move things for them."</p>
<p>Stopping trade, backing up demands with economic consequences, has
always been the Wobbly way.</p>
<p>"I'm an anarcho-syndicalist. This is what we do," Gill explained. "For
me, this is another day at work."</p>
