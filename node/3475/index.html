<p><img width="198" height="238" border="0" align="right" src="../../graphics/agitators/modern/others/strike_chalkboard.jpg" />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p> <p>June 7, 2007</p> <p>CONTACT: Tristan Bunner: 805.798.5096, calfoodworker@gmail.com</p> <p>Student Worker Action Group</p> <p>Cal Student Workers Declare Victory But Continue Struggle to Win Other Demands</p> <p>WHAT: After over 7 months of struggle, Cal student workers employed by Cal Dining are declaring a partial victory today.&nbsp; They have been informed that, as of July 1, 2007, they will receive the base wage rate of $11.25/hr.&nbsp; This rate is equal to the rate non-Cal student full and part time staffs have received since August of last year, though some non-Cal student staff will soon be receiving $11.70/hr.</p> <p>Though they are happy that they will finally be receiving equal pay, Cal student food service workers still have many questions about the changes, and feel that many of their demands have not yet been met.&nbsp; When the new wage rate is implemented, will all Cal student food service workers receive $11.25/hr, or will senior workers who have received raises above the base rate in the past keep their difference in pay over those who have not?</p> <p>Through contacts in AFSCME, the union that represents UC service workers, Cal student workers have also learned that service workers within the AFSCME bargaining unit will soon be receiving a raise to $11.70/hr, retroactive to January 2007.&nbsp; The demand of the Cal student workers has always been pay equal to that of their coworkers, and they are angered that the pay inequity will only be continued this coming semester.</p> <p>Most of all, Cal student workers demand that they receive back pay for the last two semesters, since the time the wage difference began.&nbsp; They have worked 11 months with a pay rate over $2/hr less than their coworkers (including high school and community college students) simply because of their status as Cal students and they feel that they should be compensated for this gross act of discrimination.</p> <p>Though they feel that this is a victory, Cal student workers represented by Student Worker Action Group continue to make these demands and will continue to fight until they are met:</p> <p>We demand acknowledgement of our equal responsibilities!!&nbsp; This includes: 1.Equal pay to Food Service Workers. 2.Retroactive from August 2006 (the time the wage difference began). 3.Twice monthly paychecks. 4.All of the above reflected by the July 8, 2007 paycheck.</p>WHEN: Friday, June 7, 2007 <p>WHO: UC Berkeley student food service workers and their supporters who feel that it is unfair for Cal students to be paid over $2 less per hour than their coworkers doing the same job.</p><p>Student Worker Action Group (SWAG) is an organization formed by UC Berkeley student food services workers.&nbsp; One of its goals at this time is to bring attention the fact that Cal students working for Cal Dining are paid over $2 less per hour than their coworkers (starting wages are $9.11/hr and $11.25/hr), and to call for pay equity at UC Berkeley.<br /></p><p>WHERE : Cal Dining establishments on and off of the UC Berkeley Campus.<br /></p><p>STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR SOMETHING: &quot;EQUAL PAY TODAY!&quot;</p> <p>CAL STUDENT WORKERS DECLARE VICTORY BUT CONTINUE TO FIGHT.</p> <ul class="links term-links"><li class="taxonomy_term_224 first"><a href="../../category/branches/all-branches/san-francisco-bay-area-gmb/" rel="tag" title="This is the news page for our San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch.
