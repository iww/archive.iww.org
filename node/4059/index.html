RIDGEFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Tons of freight idled across the country Tuesday
as independent truckers pulled their rigs off the road while others slowed to a
crawl on major highways in a loosely organized protest of high fuel
prices.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Using CB radios and trucking Web sites, some truckers called for a strike
Tuesday to protest the high cost of diesel fuel, hoping the action might
pressure President Bush to stabilize prices by using the nation's oil
reserves.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;The gas prices are too high,&quot; said Lamont Newberne, a trucker from
Wilmington, N.C., who along with 200 drivers protested at a New Jersey Turnpike
service area. &quot;We don't make enough money to pay our bills and take care of our
family.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
On the Turnpike, southbound rigs &quot;as far as the eye can see&quot; staged a short
lunchtime protest by moving about 20 mph near Newark, jamming traffic on one of
the nation's most heavily traveled highways, authorities said.
</div>
<br />
<div>
By day's end, the protests ended up scattered; Major trucking companies
were not on board, and Teamsters union officials and the Owner-Operator
Independent Drivers Association denied organizing the protests.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Federal law prohibits the association from calling for a strike because it
is a trade association.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Meanwhile in Washington, top executives of the five biggest U.S. oil
companies said they know high prices are hurting consumers but deflected any
blame and argued their profits - $123 billion last year - were in line with
other industries.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Clayton Boyce, spokesman for the American Trucking Association, said diesel
prices are the worst he's seen but said his organization does not support or
condone the strike.
</div>
<br />
<div>
His group is pushing for a number of measures to keep the prices down or to
otherwise help truckers, including allowing exploration of oil-rich areas of the
U.S. that are now off limits and setting a 65 mph national speed
limit.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Newberne said a typical run carrying produce from Lakeland, Fla., to the
Hunt's Point Market in The Bronx, N.Y., had cost $600 to $700 a year ago. It now
runs him $1,000.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Outside Chicago, three truck drivers were ticketed for impeding traffic on
Interstate 55, driving three abreast at low speeds, the state police said. About
30 truckers drove in a convoy around metropolitan Atlanta at low speeds, police
said.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Near Florida's Port of Tampa, more than 50 tractor-trailer rigs sat idle as
their drivers demanded that contractors pay them more to cover their fuel and
other costs.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;We can no longer haul their stuff for what they're paying,&quot; said David
Santiago, 35, a trucker for the past 17 years.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Charles Rotenbarger, 49, a trucker from Columbus, Ohio, said he felt
helpless.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;The oil company is the boss, what are we going to be able to do about it?&quot;
said Rotenbarger, who was at a truck stop at Baldwin, Fla., about 20 miles west
of Jacksonville. &quot;The whole world economy is going to be controlled by the oil
companies. There's nothing we can do about it.&quot;
</div>
<br />
<div>
Jimmy Lowry, 51, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and others said it costs about $1
a mile to drive one of the big rigs, although some companies are offering as
little as 87 cents a mile. Diesel cost $4.03 a gallon at the truck
stop.
</div>
<br />
<div>
Rather than join the protests, some truckers were forced to sit idle
because of shippers' fears of a possible strike.
</div>
<br />
<div>
In western Michigan, independent trucker William Gentry had been scheduled
to pick up a load and take it to Boston, but his dispatcher told him there was a
change of plans.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;She told me that her shipper was shutting down,&quot; fearing that someone
would sabotage deliveries if their drivers worked during the protest, Gentry
said at the Tulip City Truck Stop outside Holland, Mich.
</div>
<br />
<div>
He and Bob Sizemore, 55, a 30-year veteran trucker, decided to return to
their homes in Ohio, 280-mile trips that would cost each one about $200 of their
own money for fuel alone.
</div>
<br />
<div>
&quot;We can't ride around here looking for freight,&quot; said Gentry, 47, a driver
for 23 years.
</div>
<br />
<div>
If something isn't done about fuel prices, the cost of consumer goods will
shoot up, Gentry said. &quot;People aren't seeing that the more we pay, the more
they're going to pay.&quot;
</div>
