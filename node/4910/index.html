<p class="submitted">Submitted on Mon, 01/18/2010 - 7:55pm</p>
<p><u>Disclaimer</u>: <i>the following is the opinion of the author and not the official position of the IWW.</i></p>
<p>
When the earthquake leveled much of Haiti, including the
Presidential Palace, it destroyed the capitalist state apparatus as well as
buildings and lives. In a country whose history includes bloody repression and
paramilitary death squads, all reports were that both the police and the
military had disappeared from the streets.
</p>
<p>
For several days, the US administration dithered,
uncertain of what to do. Then Obama announced the sending of troops to Haiti along
with the commitment of the miserly sum of $100 million in aid (one third less
than was spent on his inaugural ball). What is the purpose of those troops
there? 
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>“Restoring Order”</strong>
</p>
<p>
The conservative Heritage Fund spelled it out: <em>“<span style="color: black">We should rapidly
deploy sufficient US
military and civilian forces to help Haitians restore order in the capital of Port-au-Prince and in
surrounding areas,”</span></em><span style="color: black"> they write on their
web site.</span> They also clearly see the necessity of using the troops to
prevent the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes from increasing their influence in Haiti.
Nobody should be surprised if conflicts develop along these lines in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>
Obama also carried out the Heritage Fund’s recommendation of
appointing Bill Clinton and George Bush to head up US initiatives in Haiti.
Clinton has a long
history of helping foster neo liberal policies there (low wages and
privatization) as well as having supported the coup against Aristide. Bush is
famed for his administration’s “relief” effort in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The
failure to provide timely aid in Haiti
shows that the direction of efforts in New Orleans
was no mere accident, nor the product of the incompetence of one particularly
stupid US
president; it was the result of the policy of massive privatization. The fact
that these two are in their present position regarding Haiti shows
that nothing has changed.
</p>
<p>
One of the US
military’s first steps was to seize control of the port and the airport at Port-au-Prince. Their
priority has been to land more troops and lift out endangered US citizens. In fact, as the
British <em>Guardian</em> newspaper reports
(1/17/10) this is creating serious tensions with other countries – both rivals
and allies – who are seeking access to the airport. 
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Providing Urgent Aid</strong>
</p>
<p>
The main issue, though, is the delay in food, water and
medical supplies reaching the Haitians. The US media gives the impression that
the main reason involves “bottlenecks” at the airport, destroyed and blocked
roads, etc. However, the US
priorities are clarified by <span style="color: black">of </span><span>Jarry Emmanuel, air logistics officer for the UN's
World Food Program, who told the New York Times. <em>&quot;Most flights (allowed by the US
to land) are for the US
military. Their priorities are to secure the country. Ours are to feed. We have
got to get those priorities in sync.&quot;</em></span> This is the reason that,
as <em>al-Jazeera</em> reports, “<em><span style="color: black">People could see
helicopters flying overhead, US military vehicles in the city and aeroplanes
arriving at the airport with supplies, so it was difficult to understand why
little aid appeared to be reaching the people.”</span></em><span style="color: black"></span> 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, a few Haitian troops and police are back on the
streets. Already some clashes with crowds are reported. When US troops go
out on patrol, as they inevitably will, what will their focus be?
</p>
<p>
The US
press, ever a good predictor of coming US policy, is now full of comments
about “looters” and near riot situations. This is to establish the
justification here at home for direct repression by the US troops,
including orders to shoot to kill. 
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Return of State Apparatus</strong>
</p>
<p>
This shows priority of the US military which is, first to
establish the presence of some sort of (capitalist) state apparatus until the
Haitian ruling class can re-establish the Haitian state apparatus. Naturally,
during a time of utter crisis such as now, the state apparatus will have to
carry out some “humanitarian” aid. After all, capitalism cannot function and
profits cannot be made if the working class is in such desperate straits. But
this is purely a secondary by-product. 
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Neighborhood Committees</strong>
</p>
<p>
There is and was a clear alternative to reliance on US (and
UN) troops there. The 1985 earthquake in Mexico
City shows this. As opposed to Haiti, the Mexico
City earthquake did not devastate the nation as a
whole, and therefore the state apparatus was not nearly destroyed. However, in Mexico City it failed to
provide the forces for rescue and similar operations. As a result, neighborhood
committees developed to clear the rubble, carry out rescue operations, etc.
They showed how workers’ councils could start to develop. These neighborhood
committees continued and flourished and out of them developed a mass
community-based political movement in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>
In Haiti,
there was already the infrastructure for such a development in the existence of
the Lavalas Party, which has strong roots in the working class communities.
Their base was demonstrated once again just last April, when Lavalas was barred
from participating in the elections there. They called for a boycott and
practically the entire Haitian population responded. Voter turnout was between
3-10%.
</p>
<p>
With little but their bare hands, Haitian workers were
starting to organize to carry out rescue operations, including digging people
out of the rubble. Within a day or two of the earthquake, Aristide stated his
willingness to return to Haiti
from his exile in South
Africa. Given that the state apparatus – the
military and police – had disappeared, he would have been able to do so without
being killed. He could have then helped build an organizing center for rescue
operations. Neighborhood committees, possibly based on the Lavalas Party, would
have inevitably developed further and would have started to coordinate their
efforts. With the return of Aristide, these committees would have started to
take on a national role, including controlling both the port and the airport,
in order to coordinate aid. 
</p>
<p>
Naturally, these tasks would have spilled over to the tasks
of the daily running of society.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Working Class Appeal</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Most of the foreign troops are composed of working class
people. Especially given the history of racism in the US and the racial composition of the US troops, as well as the severe economic crisis
at home under which many of these US soldiers are suffering, they
would be very open to fraternization by Haitian workers’ committees.
</p>
<p>
Now, several unions are mobilizing aid for Haiti. These same unions have a
long history of acting as a front for the CIA and the US State Department.
Their efforts to mobilize aid are positive, but it is likely that it will be
used to buttress the aims of the US administration, rather than to
help Haitian workers free themselves from the chains of poverty. Especially on
the East Coast, many of these unions have a large Haitian membership. The IWW
and other anti-capitalist forces within the labor movement can play an
important role. We should involve ourselves in these efforts and through this
make direct contact with our Haitian fellow workers. Through this, we should
seek means of campaigning for: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A real, worker-based aid program.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All foreign troops – including US and
UN – out of Haiti.</strong></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black"><strong><span style="color: windowtext">Direct
links between the Haitian workers movement – community groups and unions –
and that of the rank-and-file workers here in the US.</span></strong></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black"><strong><span style="color: windowtext">Fraternization
between Haitian workers, international aid workers (including from Cuba and Venezuela) and US and other
troops.</span></strong></li>
