<strong>By John Reimann<br />
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Ronald Reagan ran for re-election for president in
1984, he declared that it was “springtime for America”. He should have said it
was “springtime for Corporate America.” Under his administration and those that
followed, Corporate America and the world wide capitalist class increased its
domination of the world, seemingly without an equivalent resistance from the
working class, especially from the US working class. While this has
started to change in recent years, the movement in the US has been
lagging far behind.
</p>
<p>
Now that is starting to change.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Youth Movement</strong>
</p>
<p>
In California,
a college and university student movement started over the last six months. The
attacks on college and university students that have generated this movement
are part of wider attacks on public education as well as on all public services
and on the working class in general. Almost immediately, the university
students grasped the slogan “defend free public education” – making the link
between their own situation and that of public education in general. At a California state-wide
student conference last October, it was agreed to organize a state-wide strike
for March 4.
</p>
<p>
Here in the working class town of Oakland,
California,
an “Outreach Committee” was set up build the movement in this area. One key
issue was decided immediately: Our intent was to actually disrupt the workings
of the state, and we were going to try to do that through setting up a protest
starting at noon, rather than at the end of the work day. We also wanted this
to be an event of, by and for the youth of Oakland.
</p>
<p>
This contrasted to San
Francisco, where the union officialdom conspired with
the Board of Education to block a day-time rally. There, they organized a rally
for 5:00 p.m. to ensure that workers didn’t walk off work and students didn’t
walk out of school. Throughout the region, those forces who sought to tame the
movement pushed for attendance at this San Francisco
rally rather than the one in Oakland.
</p>
<p>
A key focus in Oakland
was to organize in the high schools. However, the size of our effort was
limited by the extreme constraints on our actual forces and resources. As a
result, in most schools we were unable to establish regular working groups to
organize a strike. Yet on March 4, by 7:30 in the morning, there were some 30
or 40 students standing outside the high school near my home, with home-made
picket signs in hand, shouting and cheering. <em>With just the minimal outside help, these students had organized
themselves!</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Euphoria</strong>
</p>
<p>
The noon rally at the city center was one of the most
dynamic this particular participant has ever seen in his 40 years of activism,
as wave after wave of students came rolling into the rally. Hundreds of
students from Oakland
High School, came marching
in, shouting, cheering and dancing. Then came students from East Oakland, from
other parts of Oakland, and finally from Berkeley, including University
of California, Berkeley. Each contingent was greeted with
euphoria, and they responded in kind.
</p>
<p>
It was consciously decided in advance that we wanted the
real voice of the youth to be heard, not some pre-packaged speeches of
“important”, mainly older, people. An important part of this plan was to have
the music of the youth – rap or “spoken word” - be part of the program. Each
contingent of students decided for themselves who would represent them. No mere
quotes on an article can adequately portray the electricity of the event, no
more than a photograph can portray the splendor of the Grand
Canyon. With that in mind, here are some quotes from the event.
(Note that almost every other comment was greeted by hands and fists waving in
the air and youth cheering and shouting.):
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong><em>“They
Can’t Keep Us Down”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
From two high school students<em>: “We want all the students’ voices to be heard, no matter what… Si se
puede! (‘Yes we can’ in Spanish).”…. “You cut funding, you cut our dreams
away.” “Power to the people”<span> </span>“We know
that the schools in the hills (where the wealthy tend to live) aren’t being
cut; we know that the schools in the (working class) flats (flatlands) are
being cut.”</em>
</p>
<p>
From a young teacher: <em>“My
parents are immigrants. They came to the country for hope. I don’t see hope….
I’m glad to see that you all know that… you are the future, and I want every
one of you to feel that you have a future and a life that is yours, not someone
else’s…. I see a community here that is helping itself, and we got to let them
know that they can’t keep us down, can they? (</em>Chorus of<em> “noooo!”).”</em>
</p>
<p>
From short interviews with two community college students: <em>“Everything is broken… We need money. We
need teachers… this is the start of something (not just a one day affair).” <span> </span>…“This is the beginning of something…. This is
for the older generation, the younger generation, for everybody.”</em>
</p>
<p>
From a former substitute teacher, presently a construction
worker and socialist: <em>“You should be very
proud of the historical traditions of your city. The very last general strike
in the US took place in this
city (Oakland),
Dec. 1, 1946. Twenty years later, straight out of West
Oakland, Huey P. Newton, Bobby <span> </span>Seale and 16 year old Bobby Hutton started the
black Panthers…. We’ve taken the struggle forward. We are not stopping. This <span> </span>must be one of the opening shots. Are you with
me? (</em>Cheers and shouts of<em>“Yeaaahhh!”)
Should education be free? (Yeaaaahhhhh!”)”</em>
</p>
<div align="center">
<strong>Music and “Controlled Chaos”</strong>
</div>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is said that every movement of working class people
generates its own music. This was clearly seen here, as the music of the youth
– rap, or “spoken word” – was a central part of the program. The unrelenting,
driving energy of the rap artists permeated the entire event.
</p>
<p>
In the history of military strategy and tactics, it is often
noted that any plan for any particular battle almost always breaks down within
the first few minutes as it is impossible to account for all the factors
involved. To an extent, this was what happened at the Oakland protest; from the start, the enormous
enthusiasm led to a state of near chaos on the stage as dozens of students
nearly overwhelmed the stage, and the organizers were unprepared for this. It
was a state of near ‘controlled chaos”, but this very state was overall
positive. The youth, themselves, clearly saw and felt that this was <em>their</em> event, that it was <em>their</em> feelings and thoughts that were being
expressed in the way that <em>they,
themselves</em> express things.
</p>
<p>
The general mood was shown by an “after-party” event, when a
group of protesters went up onto the nearby freeway and blocked it off. Before
the police were able to arrest them and clear the freeway, a giant traffic jam
had been created. This was at the rush hour in the afternoon. Normally, workers
getting off from work are extremely angry if anything impedes their progress in
getting home. In this case, however, several of the traffic blockers reported
that many drivers were honking and waving in support.
</p>
<p>
The Oakland protest stands as
sharp contrast to that organized for 5:00 p.m. by the Oakland
school teachers’ union officialdom nearby and the one at the same time
organized in San Francisco by a combined effort
of the San Francisco capitalist politicians and
the San Francisco
union hierarchy. Both were tame and dull in contrast.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Movement Will Continue</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unlike developments of previous decades, this youth movement
is almost certain to carry on, since the issue that generates it – the economic
crisis and the resulting economic attacks – will not disappear. As it does, it
will tend to sink ever deeper roots into the working class as a whole. This is
so because, unlike the period of the youth movements of the 1960s and ‘70s, in
this period the working class as a whole has been facing major and ongoing
attacks. Combined with this has been the process of an ever-increasing
isolation between the rank and file of the unions and their own leadership. As
a result, the union hierarchy is in a far weaker position to control and co-opt
this growing movement.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Attempts to Co-opt</strong>
</p>
<p>
This doesn’t mean they won’t try. They are already combining
with the liberal wing of the (capitalist controlled) Democratic Party to divert
the movement. The main drive in that attempt is to tame it, to make it less
confrontational and less disruptive. Coinciding with this is an attempt to
channel its goals into those more acceptable to the union officialdom and the
liberal Democrats. They have two main goals: First is channel this growing
movement away from direct confrontation with and mass disobedience of the
forces of the state; they will attempt this through attempts to drag the
movement into liberal Democratic politics. In addition, they will try to divert
the movement into more tame goals.
</p>
<p>
It is inevitable that in the earlier stages of this youth
movement, the focus will be on public education. However, it was clear from
talking with different young people that they clearly see the link between this
and the attacks on all workers. It will be important to consciously foster this
as the movement develops. In addition, the issue of seeking a solution through
the established channels (the Republicans and Democrats) will be advocated.
There will be a natural suspicion to this, which the more independent forces
must base themselves on. In order to do so, it is this particular writer’s
opinion, that an alternative to the Democrats must be developed – that is, a
mass, working class political party, whose candidates are committed to
representing and living at the same level as the workers they represent.
</p>
<p>
No movement of any sector of the working class, however,
develops in a straight line towards confronting the system as a whole. However,
the conditions for this are more present now than at any time in this writer’s
experience. This is because of the economic crisis that capitalism as a whole
is experiencing and the resulting unrelenting attacks on the working class.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>Global Spring Time</strong>
</p>
<p>
This general mood in society was shown by an “after-party”
event, when a group of protesters went up onto the nearby freeway and blocked
it off. Before the police were able to arrest them and clear the freeway, a
giant traffic jam had been created. This was at the rush hour in the afternoon.
Normally, workers getting off from work are extremely angry if anything impedes
their progress in getting home. In this case, however, several of the traffic
blockers reported that many drivers were honking and waving in support.
</p>
<p>
Thus, a new “spring time” is dawning in America - a spring time for the US working
class. As opposed to how spring weather develops globally – where spring in the
Northern Hemisphere means fall in the global South – this springtime is a
global spring for the world’s working class.
