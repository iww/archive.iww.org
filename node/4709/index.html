</p>
<p>
WHEN BANK of America hosted a conference call to discuss how to
defeat the Employee Free Choice Act, one executive used a new
formulation: &quot;the Starbucks problem.&quot;
</p>
<p>
His worry: workers might follow the example of Starbucks baristas
and form their own unions without waiting for bigger &quot;traditional&quot;
unions to organize them.
</p>
<p>
In the past five years, the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU)--a part of
the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)--has spread from one
Manhattan store to win hundreds of members in New York City,
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Grand Rapids, Chicago and beyond.
</p>
<p>
The SWU has made inroads among a section of the workforce--low-wage
retail workers--that many unions have written off as too difficult to
organize. Indeed, organized labor represents just 5 percent of workers
in retail.
</p>
<p>
Since its formation, the SWU has won a series of important National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) rulings and achieved gains for baristas on
the job. Given the dire straits workers face today, if Corporate
America is worried about the &quot;Starbucks problem,&quot; then union members
and supporters should take a close look at the SWU.
</p>
<p>
Starbucks likes to present itself as a &quot;socially responsible
corporation.&quot; In reality, Starbucks workers face the same problems that
other retail workers face: unpredictable hours, inaccessible health
care, low wages and lack of job security.
</p>
<p>
&quot;The core of the problem boils down to this: Starbucks orders
'labor' the same way it orders coffee beans or paper cups,&quot; said Erik
Forman, who works in the Mall of America outside Minneapolis-St. Paul.
</p>
<p>
A major issue for Starbucks workers is the way the company organizes
hours. If baristas want a &quot;full-time&quot; workweek of more than 32 hours,
they must make themselves available for up to 70 hours a week.
&quot;Starbucks uses something known as 'automated labor scheduling'
software to determine how workers will be scheduled,&quot; Forman said. &quot;If
the system projects a slight downturn in business on a particular day
or week, baristas lose work hours.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The problems extend to wages and benefits. In the Minneapolis area,
starting pay hovers just above Minnesota's state minimum hourly wage of
$6.15, ranging from $6.50 to $7.50 an hour. Raises generally lag behind
increases in the cost of living. And while Starbucks widely promotes
the fact that it offers health insurance, the company spends far less
energy making sure employees are actually covered. Less than 42 percent
of Starbucks employees are on the company's health care plan--a lower
rate than Wal-Mart.
</p>
<p>
&quot;You have to work a minimum of 20 hours each week in order to
qualify,&quot; Forman said. &quot;With wild fluctuations in the number of hours
you are scheduled, workers and their families often lose their health
care for six months at a time.&quot;
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
WORKER DISCONTENT over Starbucks' pay and conditions set the stage
for organizing. In May 2004, workers at a midtown Manhattan Starbucks
launched the SWU.
</p>
<p>
From the beginning, the company went all out to bust the union. &quot;We
wanted to negotiate with Starbucks over our serious concerns,&quot; Forman
recalled. &quot;But rather than sit down at a table with us, the bosses
began writing checks to the union-busting consultants of Akin Gump and
the PR flacks at Edelman, the world's largest public relations firm.
They contracted Edelman to craft a facade of 'social responsibility.'&quot;
</p>
<p>
At first, workers filed for a NLRB election to vote on union
recognition. Starbucks responded by &quot;using its political clout to
gerrymander the bargaining unit from one pro-union store to every store
in midtown and downtown Manhattan,&quot; Foreman said.
</p>
<p>
The workers realized they couldn't win, so they tried a different
tack. Unable to go the traditional route to unionization via an NLRB
election, they drew on more radical traditions--fighting back around
wages, benefits and working conditions and recruiting baristas to the
union without official NLRB recognition. As Forman says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We've decided to go back to the basics of the labor movement. Workers
organized unions before 1935, before we had a &quot;right&quot; to organize...In
developing an organizing model that works in the service industry,
we've gone back to the roots of unionism, opting for a strategy that
puts &quot;direct action&quot; at the center. We've been able to spread because
we've done something that business unions would consider
unthinkable--we've put our organization entirely in the hands of
rank-and-file baristas.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Forman said that the SWU emphasizes what it calls &quot;solidarity
unionism&quot;--that is, the idea that &quot;workers are most powerful where the
bosses need us most: on the shop floor. Our power as workers comes from
our ability to withhold our labor, or interfere with the production
process in other ways.&quot;
</p>
<p>
At the Mall of America last summer, workers confronted management
about unbearable temperatures in the store. As Forman described it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We had been complaining about how hot it was for years, but management
refused to buy a fan or install air conditioning because it was &quot;too
expensive.&quot; At the same time, our store was pulling in $30,000 a week.
</p>
<p>
One morning, four of my coworkers walked into the back room of our
store and gave the boss an ultimatum: &quot;Will you buy the store a fan?
Yes or no?&quot; He stalled....so my four coworkers walked off the job, got
in a car and drove to Target, leaving the boss to cover the floor. He
was livid.
</p>
<p>
About 20 minutes later, my coworkers walked back in with a $14 box
fan. They plugged it in, wrote &quot;Courtesy of the IWW,&quot; drew a small
black &quot;Sabotage cat&quot; [the IWW logo] on it, and enjoyed the breeze.
</p>
<p>
This left management with a choice. They could either remove the
fan, in which case they would look like jerks. Or they could leave it
there, as a monument to their own negligence.
</p>
<p>
To their credit, they did the right thing. Two days later, the
district manager arrived with a $150 industrial floor fan. Two weeks
later, they began installing air conditioning. This is the power of
direct action. One week, $40 is too much to spend to bring the
temperature in the store to within OSHA standards. The next week,
management is spending $10,000 to keep the workers happy.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, in August 2008, a union member and single mother from the
Bronx, Anna Hurst, suffered heat stroke on the job at a New York
Starbucks and was forced off the work schedule for two weeks. In
response, a dozen baristas marched into the store during rush hours and
demanded she be compensated.
</p>
<p>
Forman recalled another situation at the Mall of America where workers' action on the job resulted in a quick victory:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of our coworkers had not been paid by Starbucks for almost a month
because of a bureaucratic mistake...When we found out about this, the
four of us who were working decided to stop work and demand that our
coworker get her paycheck. For about 10 minutes, we told customers we
were on strike, sending them elsewhere for their coffee. We called the
district manager to complain. He came to the store later that afternoon
and cut our coworker a check. We won.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
</p>
<p>
IN ADDITION to confronting management's abuse of workers on the job,
the SWU has organized pickets and rallies to draw attention to the
union and workers' fights against management.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Since 2004, we have made real progress.&quot; Forman said. &quot;After months
of pressure from the union, Starbucks conceded a wage increase for
baristas in the New York City metro area in 2006. We have fought
numerous battles over health and safety issues, discrimination, and
unfair treatment by management in the workplace. Despite Starbucks
nationally coordinated anti-union campaign, the union continues to pick
up steam.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Government documents show that Starbucks has spied on union members
(including after work hours) and transferred workers to keep down the
ratio of pro-union workers. In New York City, the company was found
guilty of nearly 30 violations of labor law--including interrogating
employees and firing union members.
</p>
<p>
As Forman explained, the Starbucks Workers Union has &quot;had to fight
tooth and nail for our right to exist as a union at Starbucks.&quot;
Starbucks management has already been forced to agree to four
settlements with the NLRB over the company's violations of the workers'
right to organize.
</p>
<p>
As a result, Starbucks has been forced to reinstate employees, pay
damages and make agreements with the union--for example, to allow
baristas to wear union pins at work. The company also faces outstanding
NLRB cases in New York, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, and Grand
Rapids, Mich.
</p>
<p>
Erik Forman himself was terminated for union activity in July last
year. The day after he was fired, workers at his store walked out in
protest, and more than 50 baristas in the Twin Cities area signed a
petition for his reinstatement. Within a month, he was rehired and paid
back wages.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, management continues to target SWU activists.
&quot;Recently, Chicago IWW barista Joe Tessone attempted to confront CEO
Howard Schultz about this treatment of baristas,&quot; Forman said. &quot;Two
weeks later, he was fired on specious grounds.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Faced with this level of harassment, Starbucks workers have put
international solidarity at the center of their campaign, including a
global day of action against Starbucks last July 5. That day, French
workers staged a sit-in at a Paris Starbucks in solidarity with fired
American baristas. As Forman said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Starbucks is a global company, so we have to be a global union. In
addition to labor solidarity, we have made efforts to build ties to
coffee farmers through our &quot;Justice from Bean to Cup&quot; initiative. We
sent Sarah Bender, a New York City barista, to Ethiopia to a meeting
with coffee farmers there who were demanding a decent price for their
beans from Starbucks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
</p>
<p>
EVEN THOUGH Starbucks remains profitable, the company is using the
economic crisis as a pretext to squeeze more out of workers. Management
tactics include cutting hours and closing stores, without cutting back
on workloads. In response, Starbucks workers have organized pickets
against layoffs and store closings, the lack of severance pay and a
speed-up in the pace of work.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Naomi Klein's recent book, <em>The Shock Doctrine</em>, comes to
mind,&quot; Forman said. &quot;While Starbucks profits have dipped, it's still an
immensely profitable company, bringing in over $300 million in pure
profit last year alone. And yet, Starbucks has used the language of
'crisis' to push through a string of anti-worker cutbacks.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Forman says the company is squeezing workers hard:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
First, they haven't increased the base wage in almost three years.
Second, they're making new demands on workers' schedules through what
management calls 'optimal scheduling,' laying off thousands of baristas
while forcing the remaining skeleton crew to be available for up to 80
hours out of the week.
</p>
<p>
On top of this, they have been running the stores at even lower
levels of staffing than in the past, leaving us scrambling to get work
done. And of course, since last summer, they've been shuttering stores,
kicking workers to the curb who made the record profits of the last
decade possible.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Liberte Locke, a New York barista, made a similar point to <em>The Epoch Times</em>
newspaper. &quot;In my store, the layoffs have been targeted at workers who
have been there the longest,&quot; she said. &quot;Employees were given no
warning: they didn't even let them finish their shifts, and they were
given no severance pay.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The company has the money to avoid these cuts. Thus, when Starbucks
recently purchased a corporate jet for $45 million, the SWU pointed out
that the money &quot;could provide over 5 million additional work hours to
employees in need or maintain its gutted 401k program for three years.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Given the scale of Starbucks' attacks, the SWU's gains are all the
more impressive. They point to how the sparks for a revitalized labor
movement could come from outside traditional unions, just as employers
fear. Other recent examples include <a href="https://socialistworker.org/2007-2/640/640_06_Cygnus.shtml"> the two-week strike by nonunion workers at the Cygnus soap factory</a> in 2007 in Chicago and <a href="https://socialistworker.org/topic/3872"> the Republic Windows and Doors factory occupation</a> in the same city in December 2008, led by the independent United Electrical workers' union.
</p>
<p>
For their part, SWU activists see themselves as part of the militant
tradition of unionism that the IWW championed at its founding in 1905.
</p>
<p>
&quot;There is a direct link between the revolutionary vision of the IWW
and the day-to-day dynamics of solidarity unionism in the Starbucks
campaign,&quot; Forman said. &quot;Our message for workers is that if we can do
it at Starbucks, we can do it anywhere. It is possible to organize,
even at Starbucks, even in the Mall of America.&quot;
