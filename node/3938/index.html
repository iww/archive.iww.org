<strong>By M.K. and other members of the Bay Area Utility Service Workers iu670 industrial organizing committee</strong>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../../graphics/IU670/EcologyCenter/iu670rally1.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="264" height="191" align="right" />
The
contract negotiations between the Bay Area IU 670 Recycling Workers
Union and the two Berkeley Recycling Companies has been a challenging
struggle, but workers have stepped up to fight for tremendous
improvements. The Bay Area IWW represents drivers at The Ecology
Center who do residential curbside pickup, and workers at The
Community Conversation Center yard who sort and process recycling
materials. Both workers have been waging shopfloor struggles to
resolve grievances and improve their working conditions. With both
contracts coming up for negotiations, workers stepped up the fight.
</p>
<p>
The
drivers met several times both at work and outside of work to draft
an ambitious list of roughly 15 demands including an across the board
wage hike, increase in pension payments by the company, and a change
to the current accident penalties. The existing agreement resulted
in termination of any driver who was involved in three accidents
incurring more than $1400 worth of damage. With the narrow winding
streets of Berkeley and the increasing costs of small accidents like
broken rear-view mirrors, we have seen several workers purposefully
dropping down to a loader after two incidents. This has resulted in
wage decreases of up to $10 per hour!
</p>
<p>
Several
months before negotiations began, workers were engaged in direct
action to maintain control over job conditions. Management had
attempted to add an additional route, and eliminate several “duo”
routes – routes picked up by a team of one driver and one loader.
After a week of headaches under these new route assignments, workers
met with IWW organizers outside of work to plan how they would get
back the old route system.
</p>
<p>
On
September 10, all of the workers met with Daniel Maher, the
operations manager and by a unanimous show of hands, demanded that
the routes be reset. Maher refused to agree and left the office.
One hour later he returned to find that that the workers hadn’t
budged – neither physically nor on their demands. In what amounted
to a seven-hour standoff, the entire workforce for the day refused to
drive the trucks and occupied the company office for the entire time.
</p>
<p>
The
crew from the buyback yard, who were holding a safety meeting at the
time, were informed about the action and decided to march over to the
Ecology Center office in solidarity. Daniel was still refusing to
agree to the route change as the drivers discussed their situation to
buyback workers.
</p>
<p>
With
the office filled to capacity by recycling workers from both shops,
Martin Borque, executive director of The Ecology Center was called in
to put out the fire. He tried to argue that the changes the company
had made would benefit the workers, but the union knew better. When
it was obvious that the crew would not back down, management conceded
to all demands. They then tried to get the drivers to agree to
perform all assigned work for the day. Since that would have had the
guys driving well into the night, they refused, promising only to
work until 5:30 PM. Again, management had no choice but to agree.
</p>
<p>
At
approximately 1:00 PM the trucks all rolled out, smiles on the
workers’ faces and the stage was set for the coming negotiations,
with workers in the driver’s seat.
</p>
<p>
The
start of negotiations was heard loud and clear on November 8th at a
rally in the Berkeley Recycling yard. The drivers took a break in
the middle of their route to come back to the yard, and the workers
from the Conservation Center walked off their posts to attend. Among
piles of recycled waste the two groups of employees laid out their
demands via bullhorn and several individuals spoke about conditions
at their workplace and how workers had to come together to fight for
a better life. The Rally finished with a 40-person strong march to
the Ecology Center office where Fellow Workers Joyce Guzman outlined
the demand list to Maher.
</p>
<p>
The
buyback workers had also been compiling their demands via an employee
survey which asked workers what most needed improvement at work.
Bargaining teams of four employees and three IWW organizers were
elected for each shop and the bargaining sessions began. At the
Ecology Center the bosses were quick to give in to several demands
including an unprecedented wage increase. No doubt this was due to
the strength and solidarity workers had demonstrated just a few
months prior.
</p>
<p>
But
by the same token, management was scrambling to eliminate the basis
for their employees’ power to stop production. They demanded
several destructive changes to the contract language including a
no-strike clause, a managements rights clause (both traditional
clauses had been absent from the Ecology Center contracts with the
IWW for almost two decades), and the elimination of the union
solidarity clause which allowed the workers to honor picket lines
during the life of the contract.
</p>
<p>
Workers
were conflicted, wanting the economic package management had proposed
but offended by the affront to their rights. After negotiations went
back and forth some compromises were reached. On
wages, Route Driver A will go from the current $24.87 to $26.50 and
Driver B will go from 22.96 to 24.50 for this coming year, with a
wage and benefits reopener for 2009. Most &quot;loaders&quot;
(assistants) will go into a new category of &quot;assistant driver&quot;
and their pay will go from the current $16.80 to $21 per hour. The
few who will remain as loaders (because they can't drive the trucks)
will go to $19.00. Improvements were also made in health benefits
and
</p>
<p>
On
the negative side, workers accepted some changes to the contract that
weren’t exactly positive. While they refused to accept the
elimination of the union solidarity clause, and management backed
down, there now exists a general “Managements Power” section, and
while they would not accept a No-Strike clause, per se, the grievance
procedure has been modified so that the union agrees to take no
strike action until the grievance procedure has been exhausted.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
at Buyback, a committee of 4 workers and three IWW organizers were
attempting to hammer out a contract with management. The main
demands were a wage hike, decreasing the health care costs, and
increasing management’s contribution to the workers’ IRA.
Management agreed to some of the union proposals, but dragged its
heels on the wage demand. After two months of negotiations and an
implicit threat of a strike by the workers, the bosses increased
their offer for a new wage table. At the time of this writing, the
workers are closing in on an agreement with management though some
issues are still unresolved. Why do Buyback workers so badly need a
raise? Fellow Worker Matt
Wathen wrote the following article about the conditions workers have
to deal with at the yard.
</p>
<p>
My
name is Matthew Wathen and I have been an employee at Berkeley
Recycling going on three years now. Over these three years I have
seen and been exposed to some of the most vile substances and
materials known to man. Working on the container line I've seen
everything from dead rats covered in maggots to human feces to used
syringes pass by. Having to grab the syringes and put them in a
special biohazard waste basket we're extra careful we don't
accidentally poke ourselves (God forbid). While sorting recyclables
on the container line I've been attacked by mosquitoes, had different
substances sprayed on my face and have had to go to the hospital to
get stitches from grabbing glass bottles even though I was wearing
glass protective gloves.
</p>
<p>
Down
by the paper line it's hard to take one step without stepping on a
pile of rat droppings. I think Berkeley Recycling is home base for
the entire population of rats in the city of Berkeley. Even though
management has done a lot to rid our work site of rat infestation,
they still roam around freely like they own the place. I say put 'em
to work!
</p>
<p>
Another
sanitary concern is the mess left by customers after they're finished
separating their materials. The customers are given a certain
section in the facility to sort their materials, and by the end of
the day that area is left knee-deep in garbage, which the employees
are left to clean up. Some of the garbage left on the ground
consists of everything from spilled food, half-empty drink
containers, broken glass, dirty socks and all sorts of disgusting
filth. Also since many of the customers are drug addicts and IV drug
users, we constantly are finding drug paraphernalia and used syringes
on the premises.
</p>
<p>
Now
everything that I have mentioned so far, as you can imagine puts the
employees at great risk, so being the end of the year, the time has
come for union workers and management to negotiate a new contract.
The starting pay here is only $11.05 per hour (keep in mind we have
families to support). Because the cost to live in the Bay Area is so
expensive and because of the risks of sanitary conditions, not to
mention the risks of accidents caused by heavy machinery (which have
happened), we have asked for an immediate increase of five dollars
per hour.
</p>
<p>
Their
counter offer is fifty cents.
