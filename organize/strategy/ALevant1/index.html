<p><b>By Alex Levant - <i>New Socialist</i>, Spring 2003</b></p>
<p>On September 7, 2000, over 100 people from the Somali community and
union supporters visited an immigration office in Toronto in defence of
four families facing deportation and waiting for decisions on their
appeals to stay on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Although they
were confident that their appeals would be successful, they feared that
they would be deported before a decision was made (a common practice for
Immigration Canada). At the families¹request, an action was called to
secure a commitment from the authorities that this would not happen.</p>
<p>The action was organized by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty
(OCAP) and supported by activists from a number of unions, including the
Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) Locals 40, 112, 199, 397, 504, 673, 707 and
1285, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Locals 79 and 3903, as
well as Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees (HERE) Local 75.</p>
<p>We all met at a nearby church, where members of each family explained
their situation. After the briefing, we walked to the immigration office
and unfurled our union flags in the lobby. Representatives from OCAP asked
to meet with management to discuss the cases in question. Immigration
Canada responded by calling security and the police. We continued to press
our demands while two small groups negotiated with immigration officials
and police. The presence of so many people in the office made it more
appealing for the officials to meet our demands than to endure the
disruption caused by our presence. As a result of our action a commitment
was secured, and the deportations were prevented.</p>
<p><b>What is a Flying Squad?</b></p>
<p>Most of the union activists at this action were organized in flying
squads. A flying squad is an association of union activists who confront
our bosses and their lackeys by disrupting the normal operations of their
organizations, much like during a strike. When workers go on strike we do
not only withdraw our labour, but we also disrupt the functioning of our
workplaces. Flying squads take this tactic beyond their own workplaces,
challenging the effects of capitalism and the forms of oppression that
capitalism mobilizes. Supporting striking workers, as well as unorganized,
unemployed, and unpaid workers, stopping deportations, challenging abusive
landlords, and mobilizing for mass protests against capitalist
globalization are some of the activities that flying squads in Canada have
engaged in.</p>
<p><b>Recent History</b></p>
<p>There is no definitive answer to when flying squads first emerged.
According to Joanne Beck of CAW 598 Flying Squad in Sudbury, flying squads
first formed in the early 1900s in the Industrial Workers of the World
(IWW). In his book, <u>Teamster Rebellion</u>, Farrell Dobbs contends that
their prototype, cruising picket squads, first appeared during the 1934
Teamsters strikes in Minneapolis. However, they re-emerged as a promising
force in Ontario in the CAW in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>According to Steve Watson, a National Representative in the Education
Department of the CAW, the first CAW flying squad was jointly started by
locals 195, 200 and 444. "In 1995-96, with the election of the Harris
government, in Windsor local activists first set up a flying squad to
ensure that there would be a rapid mobilization capacity around social
actions." This idea spread through the CAW Education Center and its Paid
Education Program, as part of the mobilization for the Ontario Days of
Action against the Tory government. Today there are flying squads in CAW
locals across Ontario, with the largest ones in Ingersoll, Kitchener,
Oakville, Hamilton, and Sudbury.</p>
<p>Inspired by the CAW flying squads, activists in CUPE began to form
their own flying squads. CUPE local 3903 (contract faculty and graduate
student workers at York University), formed its flying squad in July 2000.
This quickly grew into the largest and one of the most active flying
squads in the union movement, with 80 members on call. Flying squads also
formed in CUPE locals 79 (City of Toronto inside workers), 1281 (a
composite local of staff workers across Ontario), and 5500 (Ottawa transit
workers).</p>
<p>Our success at making immediate visible gains sparked an interest in
other unions. In the fall of 2002, following the opening of the "Pope
Squat" organized by OCAP, members of the Ontario Secondary School
Teachers¹ Federation (OSSTF), the Elementary Teachers of Toronto (ETT),
and the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association (OECTA) formed the
Toronto Teachers Flying Squad. "The motivation behind this was to give
teachers a more visible presence in protests as teachers," explains Rob, a
founding member of the Toronto Teachers Flying Squad.</p>
<p>The Toronto Teachers Flying Squad is unique because it draws its
members from several unions. "We are open to all educators," Rob
continues. "The idea behind this coalition was to have a space, which
crosses some of the unions, so that elementary teachers, secondary
teachers, and Catholic teachers could all work together, which we don¹t
often see from our unions." Although they just started a few months ago,
they already have more than 20 members on call.</p>
<p><b>Significance</b></p>
<p>The power of flying squads to make a significant difference in people¹s
lives has struck a chord among unionized workers with flying squads
sprouting across the union movement in Ontario. Their potential is vast.
"My dream is that anywhere an injustice is taking place, and people call
for help, to have union members there in force to help them in their
battles," says Watson. "A lot of repressive laws would become inoperable."
The significance of flying squads goes far beyond their capacity to
mitigate the effects of capitalism on specific individuals. What is
particularly exciting about their emergence is not only their success at
"beating back the corporate attack", but their potential to help end this
attack altogether.</p>
<p>By focusing on employed and unionized workers, flying squads tap into
the most potent source of resistance to the capitalist bulldozer. Employed
workers occupy a unique structural position in society. Since the
employing class depends on us selling our labour, we have a special power
(and responsibility) in the struggle for social justice.</p>
<p>However, our power as employed workers remains largely untapped. Unions
mobilize our collective strength to improve our wages and working
conditions, but this tends to be the limit and only scratches the surface
of our potential. In reality, we have much more power than our employers
would have us believe. There is no reason why we could not operate our
workplaces democratically, reaping the full product of our labour. Instead
of following the dictates of our employers and producing whatever makes a
profit for them, we could democratically decide what, when and how to
produce, taking into consideration our collective needs and that of our
shared environment.</p>
<p>But there is a gap between what we are objectively able to achieve and
what appears possible in the minds of most workers. While the global
justice movement has made considerable headway in recent years on this
front, most workers in the overdeveloped world still believe that another
world is not possible. This gap reflects the crisis of working class
self-organization. This crisis often paralyses the working class, and
flying squads are key to overcoming this paralysis.</p>
<p>The crisis of working class self-organization is produced not only by
deliberate disinformation and propaganda of the corporate media, but also
by our actual life-experiences under capitalism. For example, the
experience of having to compete with each other for work atomizes us and
stunts our capacity for collective action. Similarly, experiencing our
workplaces as dictatorships of our employers pacifies us. This contributes
to our transformation into spectators rather than actors. A whole range of
our abilities atrophy as a result of life under capitalism.</p>
<p>In response, flying squads help foster our capacities for collective
action. They give us an opportunity to experience our collective power to
effect change.</p>
<p>Such experiences are transformative: they develop our abilities and
feed our imaginations, extending the horizon of possibilities. By
developing abilities that normally atrophy under capitalism, flying squads
help overcome the crisis of working-class self-organization.</p>
<p><b>Flying Squads and Unions</b></p>
<p>Flying squads build on the achievements of unions and help to overcome
the crisis of working class self-organization by facilitating collective
action beyond the limits of unions. The "no strike, no lockout" clause
that is part of every collective agreement in Canada pacifies us by
cutting us off from our power to disrupt the functioning of our workplaces
during the lives of our collective agreements. This "class truce"
demonstrates both the power and the limit of unions today.</p>
<p>By mobilizing workers for direct action between rounds of bargaining,
when disruption of workplaces is prohibited by collective agreements,
flying squads maintain mobilization and continue to develop our capacities
for collective action.</p>
<p>But in order for flying squads to be effective, they must work as
autonomous organizations, rather than committees of union locals. This
approach is vital if flying squads are to exceed the limits of unions.</p>
<p>The CUPE 3903 Flying Squad maintains its autonomy by structuring itself
as a separate organization from the union with a common membership. It is
completely separate from all the decision-making and financial structures
of the local.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Toronto Teachers Flying Squad aims to maintain autonomy
with respect to the unions from which it draws its members.</p>
<p>According to Euan Gibb of CAW 707 Flying Squad: "There is no formalized
relationship" between flying squads and the local and national executives
in the CAW. Watson characterizes the relationship as one of "give and
take." "As a staff member of the union, I try to respect the autonomy of
the flying squads. At the same time they appreciate any support they can
get from the national union."</p>
<p>Beck is more critical of how this relationship actually takes place on
the ground. "Some local executives are still not completely for this
method of getting the message out, but they are in the minority."</p>
<p>Flying squads have generally been received by union executives with
caution and ambivalence. "They're not against it, but they're not
wonderfully supportive either," explains Rob specifically with respect to
the OSSTF executive. "They won't allow you to identify yourself as a union
member" at flying squad actions.</p>
<p>Flying squads have become a pole of attraction for activists in locals
dominated by conservative leaders who practice "business unionism" -
treating unions as businesses that provide services to members in exchange
for dues payments. Such locals themselves contribute to the crisis of
working-class self-organization by discouraging members' self-activity.
Flying squads pose a threat to such union leaders' positions by fostering
membership activism, which bolsters left opposition currents in these
unions.</p>
<p>But even unions that practice "social unionism" ­ making unions part of
struggles for social justice ­ have not fully embraced flying squads.
Progressive union leaders would be wise to recognize the different roles
flying squads and unions are able to play. Both unions and flying squads
work best by respecting each other¹s roles in our common struggle.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest mockery of the flying squad phenomenon has been
the Ontario Federation of Labour¹s (OFL) Solidarity Network. While the
objectives of this network were ostensibly similar to those of flying
squads, its top-down structure prevented it from being effective. All
actions had to be cleared by the OFL bureaucracy, including its President,
Wayne Samuelson. Rather than fostering workers" participation, the
Solidarity Network simply reproduced the same decision-making structures
that turn people into spectators under capitalism. As a result, the
Solidarity Network was a flop. The link to subscribe to it on the OFL
website aptly leads to a dead end.</p>
<p>In contrast, flying squads help overcome the crisis of working-class
self-organization and reduce the gap between what is objectively possible
for us to achieve and what appears possible in the minds of most workers.
They are a key next step in the development of workers' abilities to
govern themselves and hint at the self-management of our workplaces that
is vital if we are to build a truly democratic society.</p>
